    "description": ".. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/megaparsex/master/media/megaparsex.png\n   :alt: \n\ncredits\n=======\n\n-  name by Liam Moore\n\nintroduction\n============\n\n``megaparsex`` is a Python module that features parsing and associated\nutilities. It features parsing functions that detect keyphrases in input\ntext and that then return text, seek confirmations and run functions in\nresponse. It features functions that accept a list of parsing functions\nso that collections of parsing functions can be combined and new parsing\nfunctions can be added easily.\n\nIt features a confirmation class that contains the ability to check\nresponses for confirmation or denial while containing a function with\noptional keyword arguments to run on detection of confirmation together\nwith optional specialized prompts and responses to confirmation and\ndenial. It features a command class that contains the ability to request\nan input that is to be run as a command and to run that command, and\ncontains a prompt.\n\nSome associated utilities are functions for manual input, to run system\ncommands, to report IP information, to report weather information, to\nreport system status, to restart a script, and to make a reverse-SSH\nconnection.\n\nSee example code for basic usage information.\n\nsetup\n=====\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo pip install megaparsex\n\ncoding ideas\n============\n\nThe multiparse function can combine a number of predefined or custom\nparser functions. Simple interactions involve responding to a single\ntext input with text or by running a function. More complex interactions\ninvolve responding to a single text input but with a confirmation object\nwhich is used to ask for a confirmation before proceeding with defined\nactions. Still more complex interactions could involve nested parsers,\nwhereby a parser or set of parsers is used to extract a response and\nthat response can be used to propagate to nested parsers.\n",
