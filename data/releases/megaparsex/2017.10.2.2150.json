It features parsing functions that detect keyphrases in input\ntext and that then return text, seek confirmations and run functions in\nresponse. It features functions that accept a list of parsing functions\nso that collections of parsing functions can be combined and new parsing\nfunctions can be added easily.\n\nIt features a confirmation class that contains the ability to check\nresponses for confirmation or denial while containing a function with\noptional keyword arguments to run on detection of confirmation together\nwith optional specialized prompts and responses to confirmation and\ndenial. It features a command class that contains the ability to request\nan input that is to be run as a command and to run that command, and\ncontains a prompt.\n\nSome associated utilities are functions for manual input, to run system\ncommands, to report IP information, to report weather information, to\nreport system status, and to restart a script.\n\nSee example code for basic usage information.\n\ncoding ideas\n============\n\nThe multiparse function can combine a number of predefined or custom\nparser functions. Simple interactions involve responding to a single\ntext input with text or by running a function. More complex interactions\ninvolve responding to a single text input but with a confirmation object\nwhich is used to ask for a confirmation before proceeding with defined\nactions. Still more complex interactions could involve nested parsers,\nwhereby a parser or set of parsers is used to extract a response and\nthat response can be used to propagate to nested parsers.\n",
