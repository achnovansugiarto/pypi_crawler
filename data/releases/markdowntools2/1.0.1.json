    "description": "MarkdownTools2\n==============\n\nMarkdownTools is a collection of command line utilities for processing \nMarkdown text files. At the moment the collection includes only one \nutility: ``mdmerge``. Over time additional utilities will be added to \nsupport Markdown workflows. \n\n**Note:** if you are using Python 3, then you need the \n``MarkdownTools`` package.\n\nmdmerge\n=======\n\n``mdmerge`` is a command line utility that produces a single Markdown document\nby merging a set of Markdown documents. The merge can be accomplished by \nexpanding *include* declarations found in the input files, by concatenating\na list of files found in an index file, or both.\n\nWait, doesn't Marked 2 already do that?\n---------------------------------------\n\nBrett Terpstra's `Marked 2`_ application is a GUI product that runs on OS X;\nit watches Markdown text and displays the formatted output; it has \nextensive support for multi-file Markdown documents.\n*Marked* is my tool of \nchoice for viewing formatted Markdown. I use it whenever I'm creating or \nreviewing Markdown content on my OS X machine.\nThe invaluable multi-file document support in *Marked* is what drove me to\ncreate ``mdmerge``.\n\n.. _Marked 2: http://marked2app.com\n\n``mdmerge`` brings multi-file Markdown document processing to the command line.\nIt is useful in any automated scripting environment where Markdown is\nprocessed. For example, I use it in automated build scripts \n(e.g., using gmake or Grunt) to produce documentation for the\nsoftware I'm building.\nIt is cross-platform; you can pre-process the \nMarkdown files on any common OS that has a recent version of Python.\n\nWhat kinds of Markdown does it work with?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n``mdmerge`` has been tested with documents containing these Markdown syntax\nvariants:\n\n* classic (John Gruber's Markdown_ syntax)\n* MultiMarkdown (Fletcher Penny's syntax, MultiMarkdown_ version 4)\n* GHF (`GitHub Flavored Markdown`_)\n\n.. _Markdown:\n\thttp://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n.. _MultiMarkdown: http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/\n.. _GitHub Flavored Markdown:\n\thttps://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown\n\nHow do files get included?\n--------------------------\n\n``mdmerge`` accepts include declarations in these styles:\n\n* MultiMarkdown transclusions_\n* `Marked file includes`_\n* `LeanPub code includes`_ (as `interpreted by Marked`_)\n* `LeanPub index files`_ (also known as *book* files)\n* `mmd_merge index files`_\n\n.. _Marked file includes: \n\thttp://marked2app.com/help/Multi-File_Documents.html\n.. _interpreted by Marked: \n\thttp://marked2app.com/help/Special_Syntax.html#includingcode\n.. _LeanPub code includes: \n\thttps://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-code\n.. _LeanPub index files: \n\thttps://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-the-booktxt-file\n.. _transclusions: \n\thttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/transclusion\n.. _mmd_merge index files: \n\thttps://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support/blob/master/Utilities/mmd_merge.pl\n\nIncludes can be nested; that is, a file can include another file that itself\ninclude other files, and so on. Index (or book) files are only processed\nas such when they are the primary input; they cannot be nested -- files \nlisted in the index file are treated as normal input files (including\nexpanding include specifications found within).\n\nCommand Line Syntax\n===================\n\nThe command line looks like this:\n\n::\n\n\tmdmerge [options] [-o outputfile] inputfiles\n\tmdmerge [options] [-o outputfile] -\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n``options``\n\tOne or more of `--book`, `--export-target`, `--ignore-transclusions`,\n\t`--just-raw`, `--leanpub`, `--version`, `--help`, `-h`.\n\n``--book``\n\tTreat STDIN as an index file (a \"book\" file).\n\n``--export-target [html|latex|lyx|opml|rtf|odf]``\n\tIndicates the ultimate output target of the markdown processor, but \n\tprimarily impacts wildcard substitution in Marked inclusion.\n\n``--help``\n\tHelp information\n\n``-h``\n\tHelp information\n\t\n``--ignore-transclusions``\n\tLeave any MultiMarkdown transclusion specifications alone; do not include\n\tthe specified file. Useful if you want to mix Marked/LeanPub includes and\n\tMultiMarkdown includes, but have MultiMarkdown handline the transclusions.\n\n``--just-raw``\n\tIgnore all include specifications except for raw includes; useful for\n\tprocessing the output of the Markdown processor to pick up the raw file include\n\tspecifications that should have passed through untouched.\n\n``--leanpub``\n\tIndicates that any input file named `book.txt` should be treated as a\n\tLeanPub index file.\n\n``--version``\n\tGives the version information about the utility.\n\n``-o outputfile``\n\tThe filepath in which to store the merged text. If not specified, then \n\tSTDOUT is used.\n\n``--outfile outputfile``\n\tsame as `-o`.\n\n``inputfiles``\n\tA list of space separated input files that can be merged together. If\n\tmultiple files are given, they are treated as if they were specified \n\tin a LeanPub index file.\n\n``-``\n\tThe input comes from STDIN.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n**Note:** Requires Python 2.6 or later. For Python 3 environments use\nthe **MarkdownTools** package.\n\nInstall with::\n\n\tpip install MarkdownTools2\n\nThis will create the command ``mdmerge``. Use ``mdmerge --version`` and \n``mdmerge --help`` to confirm the installation.\n\nFor developers\n==============\n\nLicense and Copyright\n---------------------\n\nMarkdownTools is licensed with the `Mozilla Public License`_ Version 2.0. \n\nCopyright 2014 Dave Hein\n\n.. _Mozilla Public License: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/\n\nSource code\n-----------\n\nThe source for this project can be found on GitHub at:\n\nhttps://github.com/JeNeSuisPasDave/MarkdownTools",
