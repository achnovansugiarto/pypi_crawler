Build programmatic reusable layouts out of components, having full control of the rendered HTML without writing HTML in templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django, so it plays nice with any other form application.\n\n`django-crispy-forms` supports Python 2.7/Python 3.2+ and Django 1.8+\n\nThe application mainly provides:\n\n* A filter named ``|crispy`` that will render elegant div based forms. Think of it as the built-in methods: ``as_table``, ``as_ul`` and ``as_p``. You cannot tune up the output, but it is easy to start using it.\n* A tag named ``{% crispy %}`` that will render a form based on your configuration and specific layout setup. This gives you amazing power without much hassle, helping you save tons of time.\n\nDjango-crispy-forms supports several frontend frameworks, such as Twitter `Bootstrap`_ (versions 2 and 3), `Uni-form`_ and Foundation. You can also easily adapt your custom company's one, creating your own, `see the docs`_ for more information. You can easily switch among them using ``CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK`` setting variable.\n\n.. _`Uni-form`: http://sprawsm.com/uni-form\n.. _`Bootstrap`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html\n.. _`see the docs`: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\ndjango-crispy-forms is the new django-uni-form. django-uni-form was an application created by `Daniel Greenfeld`_ that I leaded since version 0.8.0. The name change tries to better explain the purpose of the application, which changed in a significant way since its birth.\n\nIf you are upgrading from django-uni-form, we have `instructions`_ for helping you.\n\n* Lead developer: `Miguel Araujo`_\n\n.. _`Daniel Greenfeld`: https://github.com/pydanny\n.. _`Miguel Araujo`: https://github.com/maraujop\n.. _`instructions`: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#moving-from-django-uni-form-to-django-crispy-forms\n\nExample\n=======\n\nThis is a teaser of what you can do with latest django-crispy-forms. `Find here the gist`_ for generating this form:\n\n.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/LSREg.png\n\n.. _`Find here the gist`: https://gist.github.com/1838193\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nFor extensive documentation see the ``docs`` folder or `read it on readthedocs`_\n\n.. _`read it on readthedocs`: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nSpecial thanks\n==============\n\n* To Daniel Greenfeld (`@pydanny`_) for his support, time and the opportunity given to me to do this.\n* The name of the project was suggested by the fantastic Audrey Roy (`@audreyr`_)\n* To Kenneth Love (`@kennethlove`_) for creating django-uni-form-contrib from which bootstrap template pack was started.\n\n.. _`@audreyr`: https://github.com/audreyr\n.. _`@pydanny`: https://github.com/pydanny\n.. _`@kennethlove`: https://github.com/kennethlove\n\n\n.. _Django: http://djangoproject.com",
