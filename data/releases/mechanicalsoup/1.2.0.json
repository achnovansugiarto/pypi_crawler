A Python library for automating website interaction.\n\nHome page\n---------\n\nhttps://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nA Python library for automating interaction with websites.\nMechanicalSoup automatically stores and sends cookies, follows\nredirects, and can follow links and submit forms. It doesn't do\nJavaScript.\n\nMechanicalSoup was created by `M Hickford\n<https://github.com/hickford/>`__, who was a fond user of the\n`Mechanize <https://github.com/jjlee/mechanize>`__ library.\nUnfortunately, Mechanize was `incompatible with Python 3 until 2019\n<https://github.com/python-mechanize/mechanize/issues/9>`__ and its development\nstalled for several years. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API, built on Python\ngiants `Requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__ (for\nHTTP sessions) and `BeautifulSoup\n<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`__ (for document\nnavigation). Since 2017 it is a project actively maintained by a small\nteam including `@hemberger <https://github.com/hemberger>`__ and `@moy\n<https://github.com/moy/>`__.\n\n|Gitter Chat|\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n|Latest Version| |Supported Versions|\n\nPyPy3 is also supported (and tested against).\n\nDownload and install the latest released version from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MechanicalSoup/>`__::\n\n  pip install MechanicalSoup\n\nDownload and install the development version from `GitHub <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup>`__::\n\n  pip install git+https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup\n\nInstalling from source (installs the version in the current working directory)::\n\n  python setup.py install\n\n(In all cases, add ``--user`` to the ``install`` command to\ninstall in the current user's home directory.)\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe full documentation is available on\nhttps://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/. You may want to jump directly to\nthe `automatically generated API\ndocumentation <https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mechanicalsoup.html>`__.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nFrom `examples/expl_qwant.py <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/blob/main/examples/expl_qwant.py>`__, code to get the results from\na Qwant search:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    \"\"\"Example usage of MechanicalSoup to get the results from the Qwant\n    search engine.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    import re\n    import mechanicalsoup\n    import html\n    import urllib.parse\n\n    # Connect to Qwant\n    browser = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser(user_agent='MechanicalSoup')\n    browser.open(\"https://lite.qwant.com/\")\n\n    # Fill-in the search form\n    browser.select_form('#search-form')\n    browser[\"q\"] = \"MechanicalSoup\"\n    browser.submit_selected()\n\n    # Display the results\n    for link in browser.page.select('.result a'):\n        # Qwant shows redirection links, not the actual URL, so extract\n        # the actual URL from the redirect link:\n        href = link.attrs['href']\n        m = re.match(r\"^/redirect/[^/]*/(.*)$\", href)\n        if m:\n            href = urllib.parse.unquote(m.group(1))\n        print(link.text, '->', href)\n\nMore examples are available in `examples/ <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/blob/main/examples/>`__.\n\nFor an example with a more complex form (checkboxes, radio buttons and\ntextareas), read `tests/test_browser.py <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/blob/main/tests/test_browser.py>`__\nand `tests/test_form.py <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/blob/main/tests/test_form.py>`__.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage Status|\n|Requirements Status| |Documentation Status|\n|CII Best Practices|\n|LGTM Alerts|\n|LGTM Grade|\n\nInstructions for building, testing and contributing to MechanicalSoup:\nsee `CONTRIBUTING.rst <https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__.\n\nCommon problems\n---------------\n\nRead the `FAQ\n<https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html>`__.\n\n.. |Latest Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/MechanicalSoup.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MechanicalSoup/\n.. |Supported Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mechanicalsoup.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MechanicalSoup/\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg?branch=main\n   :target: https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/actions/workflows/python-package.yml?query=branch%3Amain\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/branch/main/graph/badge.svg\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup\n.. |Requirements Status| image:: https://requires.io/github/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/requirements.svg?branch=main\n   :target: https://requires.io/github/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/requirements/?branch=main\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/mechanicalsoup/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n.. |CII Best Practices| image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1334/badge\n   :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1334\n.. |Gitter Chat| image:: https://badges.gitter.im/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup.svg\n   :target: https://gitter.im/MechanicalSoup/Lobby\n.. |LGTM Alerts| image:: https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup.svg\n   :target: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/\n.. |LGTM Grade| image:: https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/python/g/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup.svg\n   :target: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/\n",
