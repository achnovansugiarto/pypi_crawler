    "summary": "Doctr\n=====\n\nA tool for automatically deploying docs from Travis CI to GitHub pages.\n\nContribute to Doctr development on `GitHub\n<https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr>`_.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall doctr with pip\n\n.. code::\n\n   pip install doctr\n\nor conda\n\n.. code::\n\n   conda install -c conda-forge doctr\n\n**Note that doctr requires Python 3.5.**\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nRun\n\n.. code::\n\n   doctr configure\n\nand enter your data. You will need your GitHub username and password, and the\nrepo you want to build the docs for.\n\nThat repo should already be setup with Travis. We recommend enabling\n`branch protection <https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/>`_ \nfor the ``gh-pages`` branch and other branches, as the deploy key\nused by Doctr has the ability to push to any branch in your repo.\n\nThen add the stuff to your ``.travis.yml`` and commit the encrypted deploy\nkey. The command above will tell you what to do. You should also have\nsomething like\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n   language: python\n   python:\n     - 3.5\n\n   sudo: false\n   env:\n     global:\n       secure: \"<your secure key from doctr here>\"\n\n   script:\n     - pip install sphinx doctr\n     - cd docs\n     - make html\n     - cd ..\n     - doctr deploy\n\n\nin your ``.travis.yml``. See `the one\n<https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_ used by Doctr\nitself for example.\n\n**Heads up:** Doctr requires Python 3.5 or newer. Be sure to run it in a\nPython 3.5 or newer section of your build matrix. It should be in the same\nbuild in your build matrix as your docs build, as it reuses that.\n\nAnother suggestion: Add\n\n.. code::\n\n   html: SPHINXOPTS += -W\n\nto your Sphinx ``Makefile``. This will make Sphinx error even if there are\nwarnings, keeping your docs more accurate.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n- **Why did you build this?**\n\n  Deploying to GitHub pages from Travis is not amazingly difficult, but it's\n  difficult enough that we wanted to write the code to do it once. We found\n  that Travis docs uploading scripts are cargo culted and done in a way that\n  is difficult to reproduce, especially the do-once steps of setting up keys.\n  The ``doctr configure`` command handles key generation automatically, and\n  tells you everything you need to do to set Doctr up. It is also completely\n  self-contained (it does not depend on the ``travis`` Ruby gem).  The ``doctr\n  deploy`` command handles key decryption (for deploy keys) and hiding tokens\n  from the command output (for personal access tokens).\n\n  Furthermore, most Travis deploy guides that we've found recommend setting up\n  a GitHub personal access token to push to GitHub pages. GitHub personal\n  access tokens grant read/write access to all public GitHub repositories for\n  a given user. A more secure way is to use a GitHub deploy key, which grants\n  read/write access only to a single repository. Doctr creates a GitHub deploy\n  key by default (although the option to use a token exists if you know what\n  you are doing).\n\n- **Why not Read the Docs?**\n\n  Read the Docs is great, but it has some limitations:\n\n  - You are limited in what you can install in Read the Docs. Travis lets you\n    run arbitrary code, which may be necessary to build your documentation.\n\n  - Read the Docs deploys to readthedocs.io. Doctr deploys to GitHub pages.\n    This is often more convenient, as your docs can easily sit alongside other\n    website materials for your project on GitHub pages.\n\n  In general, you should already be building your docs on Travis anyway (to\n  test that they build), so it seems natural to deploy them from there.\n\n- **Why does Doctr require Python 3.5?**\n\n  There are several language features of Python that we wanted to make use of\n  that are not available in earlier versions of Python, such as `keyword-only\n  arguments <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/>`_,\n  `subprocess.run\n  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run>`_, and\n  `recursive globs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html>`_. These\n  features help keep the Doctr code cleaner and more maintainable.\n\n  If you cannot build your documentation in Python 3.5, you will need to\n  install Python 3.5 in Travis to run Doctr.\n\n- **I would use this, but it's missing a feature that I want.**\n\n  Doctr is still very new. We welcome all `feature requests\n  <https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr/issues>`_ and `pull requests\n  <https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr/pulls>`_.\n\n- **Why is it called Doctr?**\n\n  Because it deploys **doc**\\ umentation from **Tr**\\ avis. And it makes you\n  feel good.",
