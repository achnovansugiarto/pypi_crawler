    "description": "# django-menus #\n\ndjango-menus is an app that provides some useful template helpers for rendering and handling menus within django projects.\n\nTo use in in your django project, it needs to be installed:\n\n\t$ pip install -E /path/to/your/venv django-menus\n\nAnd `\"menus\"` needs to be in your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n## menu_item\n\nAn inclusion template tag that will create a single instance of a menu item, which will only be rendered if the logged in user can access the referenced view. Secondly, the currently active view will have a CSS class of `active` in it's menu item.\n\n    {% load menu_item %}\n\t\n    {% menu_item \"/foo/\" \"Foo\" %}\n    {% menu_item \"/bar/\" \"Bar\" %}\n\nIf we were viewing `/foo/`, this renders to:\n\n    <a class=\"active\" href=\"/foo/\">Foo</a>\n    <a href=\"/bar/\">Bar</a>\n\nUsing the standard template. If you want, you can override the `menus/item.html` template to change the display format.\n\nYou may also pass in a string like `\"url:foo_name\"` to the first argument. This will do a `reverse('foo_name')` call (with no args or kwargs) to find a matching url.\n\nIf the menu item title is `'home'` (case insensitive), or the url path is `'/'`, then an exact match will be required to mark it as active, otherwise a prefix match is done. This means that if you had a menu item as above, and were viewing the url `/foo/bar/`, then the first menu_item would be marked as active.\n\n\n## tree_menu\n\nAn extension to [django-mptt](https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/), this is a template that you can use to have a dynamic tree menu, where selecting items with children expands them, and selecting a leaf node follows the link. To use it, you'll need to have mptt installed into your project as well as this package.\n\nYou use it like:\n\n    {% load mptt_tags %}\n    \n    {% block tree_menu %}\n      {% full_tree_for_model app_label.ModelName as menu %}\n      {% include \"menu/tree-menu.html\" %}\n    {% endblock %}\n\t\nIf you want it to dynamically hide/show nested data, then you will want to have:\n\n\t\t<script src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}menus/js/tree-menu.js\"></script>\n\t\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}menus/style/tree-menu.css\" \n\t\t\t  type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" title=\"no title\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n\nSomewhere in your page.\n\nThis part is currently in use in one small part of a project, and may change if I start to use it more. This README is a little light on because I haven't touched this code in a long, long time.",
