    "description": "django-menus\n============\n\ndjango-menus is an app that provides some useful template helpers for\nrendering and handling menus within django projects.\n\nTo use in in your django project, it needs to be installed:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install django-menus\n\nAnd ``\"menus\"`` needs to be in your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``.\n\nmenu\\_item\n----------\n\nAn inclusion template tag that will create a single instance of a menu\nitem, which will only be rendered if the logged in user can access the\nreferenced view. Secondly, the currently active view will have a CSS\nclass of ``active`` in it's menu item.\n\n::\n\n    {% load menu_item %}\n\n    {% menu_item \"/foo/\" \"Foo\" %}\n    {% menu_item \"/bar/\" \"Bar\" %}\n    {% menu_item \"http://example.com\" \"Baz\" %}\n\nIf we were viewing ``/foo/``, this renders to:\n\n::\n\n    <a class=\"active\" href=\"/foo/\">Foo</a>\n    <a href=\"/bar/\">Bar</a>\n    <a href=\"http://example.com\">Baz</a>\n\nUsing the standard template. If you want, you can override the\n``menus/item.html`` template to change the display format.\n\nYou may also pass in a string like ``\"url:foo_name\"`` to the first\nargument. This will do a ``reverse('foo_name')`` call (with no args or\nkwargs) to find a matching url.\n\nIf the menu item title is ``'home'`` (case insensitive), or the url path\nis ``'/'``, then an exact match will be required to mark it as active,\notherwise a prefix match is done. This means that if you had a menu item\nas above, and were viewing the url ``/foo/bar/``, then the first\nmenu\\_item would be marked as active.\n\ntree\\_menu\n----------\n\nAn extension to\n`django-mptt <https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/>`_, this is a\ntemplate that you can use to have a dynamic tree menu, where selecting\nitems with children expands them, and selecting a leaf node follows the\nlink. To use it, you'll need to have mptt installed into your project as\nwell as this package.\n\nYou use it like:\n\n::\n\n    {% load mptt_tags %}\n\n    {% block tree_menu %}\n      {% full_tree_for_model app_label.ModelName as menu %}\n      {% include \"menu/tree-menu.html\" %}\n    {% endblock %}\n\nIf you want it to dynamically hide/show nested data, then you will want\nto have:\n\n::\n\n        <script src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}menus/js/tree-menu.js\"></script>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}menus/style/tree-menu.css\" \n              type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" title=\"no title\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n\nSomewhere in your page.\n\nThis part is currently in use in one small part of a project, and may\nchange if I start to use it more. This README is a little light on\nbecause I haven't touched this code in a long, long time.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n1.1.2 - Create li_menu_item_disabled template tag, that will show the menu\n        item, but have it as disabled if the user may not access it.\n\n1.1.1 - Pass through args and kwargs to the test function if it accepts them.\n\n1.0.9 - Allow for adding classes, and buttons as menu items.\n\n1.0.8 - Allow for absolute urls, ie, pointing to another server. We never\ntry to validate these for permission to view, it is assumed the user can.\n\n1.0.7 - Change how version number is stored. Include a new li-item.html\ntemplate, and refactor how the template is found. Check func\\_code\nexists before accessing it. Refactor some of the handling of paths.\nBetter handle quoting issues.\n\n1.0.6 - Documentation fix only.\n\n1.0.5 - Actually install all of the static media/templates.\n\n1.0.4 - Don't fail on install if README.md missing.\n\n1.0.3 - Repackaged to include README.rst [Thanks to John Bazik\njsb@cs.brown.edu]",
