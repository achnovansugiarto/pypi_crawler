It outperforms graph-based methods\noperating on basecalled data, and can be competitive with state-of-the-art\nsignal-based methods, whilst being much faster.\n\n© 2018 Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n  * Requires only basecalled data. (`.fasta` or `.fastq`)\n  * Improved accurary over graph-based methods (e.g. Racon).\n  * 50X faster than Nanopolish (and can run on GPUs).\n  * Methylation aggregation from Guppy `.fast5` files.\n  * Benchmarks are provided [here](https://nanoporetech.github.io/medaka/benchmarks.html).\n  * Includes extras for implementing and training bespoke correction\n    networks.\n  * Works on Linux and MacOS.\n  * Open source (Mozilla Public License 2.0).\n\nTools to enable the creation of draft assemblies can be found in a sister\nproject [pomoxis](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis).\n\nDocumentation can be found at https://nanoporetech.github.io/medaka/.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMedaka can be installed in one of several ways.\n\n**Installation with conda**\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to start using medaka on both Linux and MacOS is\nthrough conda; medaka is available via the\n[bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/medaka) channel:\n\n    conda create -n medaka -c conda-forge -c bioconda medaka\n\n**Installation with pip**\n\nFor those who prefer python's native pacakage manager, medaka is also available\non pypi and can be installed using pip:\n\n    pip install medaka\n\nOn Linux platforms this will install a precompiled binary, on MacOS (and other)\nplatforms this will fetch and compile a source distribution.\n\nWe recommend using medaka within a virtual environment, viz.:\n\n    virtualenv medaka --python=python3 --prompt \"(medaka) \"\n    . medaka/bin/activate\n    pip install medaka\n\nUsing this method requires the user to provide several binaries:\n\n * [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools),\n * [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2),\n * [tabix](https://github.com/samtools/htslib), and\n * [bgzip](https://github.com/samtools/htslib)\n\nand place these within the `PATH`. `samtools/bgzip/tabix` version 1.9 and\n`minimap2` version 2.17 are recommended as these are those used in development\nof medaka.\n\n**Installation from source**\n\nMedaka can be installed from its source quite easily on most systems.\n\n Before installing medaka it may be required to install some\n prerequisite libraries, best installed by a package manager. On Ubuntu\n theses are:\n >     bzip2 g++ zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev libncurses5-dev\n >     libcurl4-gnutls-dev libssl-dev curl make cmake wget python3-all-dev\n >     python-virtualenv\n In addition it is required to install and set up git LFS before cloning\n the repository.\n\nA Makefile is provided to fetch, compile and install all direct dependencies\ninto a python virtual environment. To set-up the environment run:\n\n    # Note: certain files are stored in git-lfs, https://git-lfs.github.com/,\n    #       which must therefore be installed first.\n    git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka.git\n    cd medaka\n    make install\n    . ./venv/bin/activate\n\nUsing this method both `samtools` and `minimap2` are built from source and need\nnot be provided by the user.\n\n\n**Using a GPU**\n\nAll installation methods will allow medaka to be used with CPU resource only.\nTo enable the use of GPU resource it is necessary to install the\n`tensorflow-gpu` package. Unfortunately depending on your python version it\nmay be necessary to modify the requirements of the `medaka` package for it\nto run without complaining. Using the source code from github a working\nGPU-powered `medaka` can be configured with:\n\n    # Note: certain files are stored in git-lfs, https://git-lfs.github.com/,\n    #       which must therefore be installed first.\n    git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka.git\n    cd medaka\n    sed -i 's/tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu/' requirements.txt\n    make install\n\nHowever, note that The `tensorflow-gpu` GPU package is compiled against\nspecific versions of the NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN libraries; users are directed to the\n[tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) pages\nfor further information. cuDNN can be obtained from the\n[cuDNN Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive), whilst CUDA\nfrom the [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).\n\nDepending on your GPU, `medaka` may show out of memory errors when running.\nTo avoid these the inference batch size can be reduced from the default\nvalue by setting the `-b` option when running `medaka_consensus`. A value\n`-b 100` is suitable for 11Gb GPUs.\n\nFor users with RTX series GPUs it may be required to additionally set an\nenvironment variable to have `medaka` run without failure:\n\n    export TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true\n\nIn this situation a further reduction in batch size may be required.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n`medaka` can be run using its default settings through the `medaka_consensus`\nprogram. An assembly in `.fasta` format and basecalls in `.fasta` or `.fastq`\nformats are required. The program uses both `samtools` and `minimap2`. If\nmedaka has been installed using the from-source method these will be present\nwithin the medaka environment, otherwise they will need to be provided by\nthe user.\n\n    source ${MEDAKA}  # i.e. medaka/venv/bin/activate\n    NPROC=$(nproc)\n    BASECALLS=basecalls.fa\n    DRAFT=draft_assm/assm_final.fa\n    OUTDIR=medaka_consensus\n    medaka_consensus -i ${BASECALLS} -d ${DRAFT} -o ${OUTDIR} -t ${NPROC} -m r941_min_high_g303\n\nThe variables `BASECALLS`, `DRAFT`, and `OUTDIR` in the above should be set\nappropriately. For the selection of the model (`-m r941_min_high_g303` in the\nexample above) see the Model section following.\n\nWhen `medaka_consensus` has finished running, the consensus will be saved to\n`${OUTDIR}/consensus.fasta`.\n\nModels\n------\n\nFor best results it is important to specify the correct model, `-m` in the\nabove, according to the basecaller used. Allowed values can be found by\nrunning `medaka tools list\\_models`.\n\n\nMedaka models are named to indicate i) the pore type, ii) the sequencing\ndevice (MinION or PromethION), iii) the basecaller variant, and iv) the\nbasecaller version, with the format:\n\n    {pore}_{device}_{caller variant}_{caller version}\n\nFor example the model named `r941_min_fast_g303` should be used with data from\nMinION (or GridION) R9.4.1 flowcells using the fast Guppy basecaller version\n3.0.3. By contrast the model `r941_prom_hac_g303` should be used with PromethION\ndata and the high accuracy basecaller (termed \"hac\" in Guppy configuration\nfiles). Where a version of Guppy has been used without an exactly corresponding\nmedaka model, the medaka model with the highest version equal to or less than\nthe guppy version should be selected.\n\nMethylation Calling\n-------------------\n\n`medaka` includes a basic workflow for aggregating Guppy basecalling results\nfor Dcm, Dam, and CpG methylation. The workflow is currently very preliminary\nand subject to change and improvement.\n\nAggregating the information from Guppy outputs is a two stage process, first\nthe basecalling results are extracted `.fast5` files and placed in a `.bam`\nfile:\n\n    FAST5PATH=guppy/workspace\n    REFERENCE=grch38.fasta\n    OUTBAM=meth.bam\n    medaka methylation guppy2sam ${FAST5PATH} ${REFERENCE} \\\n        --workers 74 --recursive \\\n        | samtools sort -@ 8 | samtools view -b -@ 8 > ${OUTBAM}\n    samtools sort ${OUTBAM}\n\nThis program will extract both the basecall sequence and methylation scores,\nalign the basecall to the reference, and store results in a standard format.\nIn this preliminary workflow the methylation scores are stored in two SAM\ntags, 'MC' and 'MA', one each for 5mC and 6mA respectively. The tags are\n8bit integer array-values, one value per basecall position. This is a\ndifferent form to that proposed in the current\n[hts-specs proposition](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/418/files),\nbut allows for more trivial parsing.\n\nThe second step is to aggregate the reference-aligned information to produce\na simple tabular summary of read methylation counts:\n\n    BAM=meth.bam\n    REFERENCE=grch38.fasta\n    REGION=chr20:500000-1000000\n    OUTPUT=meth.tsv\n    medaka methylation call --meth cpg ${BAM} ${REFERENCE} ${REGION} ${OUTPUT}\n\nHere the option `--meth cpg` indicates that loci containing the sequence\nmotif `CG` should be examined for 5mC presence. Other choices are\n`dcm` for which the motifs `CCAGG` and `CCTGG` are examined for 5mC and `dam`\n(`GATC`) for 6mA.\n\nThe output file is a simple tab-delimited text file with columns:\n'ref.name', 'position', 'motif', 'fwd.meth.count', 'rev.meth.count',\n'fwd.canon.count', and 'rev.canon.count'. Here fwd./ref. indicate counts on the\ntwo DNA strands and meth./canon. indicate counts for methylated and\ncanonical bases. Note that the position field records the position of the\nfirst base in the motif recorded.\n\n### Origin of the draft sequence\n\nMedaka has been trained to correct draft sequences processed through\n[racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon), specifically `racon` run four times\niteratively with:\n\n    racon -m 8 -x -6 -g -8 -w 500 ...\n\nProcessing a draft sequence from alternative sources (e.g. the output of\n[canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu) or\n[wtdbg2](https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2)) may lead to different results.\n\nThe [documentation](https://nanoporetech.github.io/medaka/draft_origin.html)\nprovides a discussion and some guidance on how to obtain a draft sequence.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe thank [Joanna Pineda](https://github.com/jopineda) and\n[Jared Simpson](https://github.com/jts) for providing htslib code samples which aided\ngreatly development of the optimised feature generation code, and for testing the\nversion 0.4 release candidates.\n\nWe thank [Devin Drown](https://github.com/devindrown) for\n[working through](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka/issues/70)\nuse of `medaka` with his RTX 2080 GPU.\n\nHelp\n----\n\n**Licence and Copyright**\n\n© 2018 Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.\n\n`medaka` is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.\n\n**Research Release**\n\nResearch releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early\naccess to features or stimulate Community development of tools.
