    "description": "================================\nPopup forms framework for Django\n================================\n\nProblem\n-------\n\n* To have easy way to show popup window, holding any form,\n  from any page of the website (examples: send message from user\n  profile or from list of profiles; apply/withdraw to pool from\n  list of companies, etc.)\n\n* This popup window should be pre-loaded, i.e. there should not\n  be HTTP request to server in order to open popup window\n\n* In case form error occurs (some fields are missing,\n  email format is wrong, etc.) the same form should be re-populated\n  in the same page, indicating errors\n\n* After form is submitted, user should be redirected\n  to either the same, or specified page\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nThe solution consists of 4 components:\n\n* Template tag, rendering popup form and link for opening it::\n\n      {% popup_form 'id1' popup_forms.ApplyForm '/talent/apply/6/' 'popup_forms/apply_to_pool.html' %}\n      {% popup_form 'id2' popup_forms.SomeModelForm '/talent/apply/6/' 'popup_forms/apply_to_pool.html' kwarg1=... kwarg2=... %}\n\n* Decorator for view function, that is processing popup form submission,\n  and exception to handle form errors::\n\n      import popup_forms\n\n      @popup_forms.handler\n      def form_view(request):\n          if request.method == 'POST':\n              form = ApplyForm(request.post)\n              if not form.is_valid():\n                  return popup_forms.OpenFormResponse(request, form)\n              # ...\n              # ... FORM PROCESSING GOES HERE ...\n              # ...\n              return popup_forms.CloseFormResponse(request)\n          else:\n              return redirect('failure_url')\n              # or raise Http404\n              # or just popup_forms.CloseFormResponse(request)\n\n* Template to render the form, derived from popup_forms/base.html\n* (optional) context processor (popup_forms.context_processors.popup_forms),\n  that puts all PopUp form classes to context, in order not to pass it each time in view:\n\n    - in settings::\n\n        POPUP_FORMS = ('messages.forms.WriteMessageForm',\n                       'talentbutton.forms.ApplyForm',\n                       'talentbutton.forms.ConfirmForm',)\n\n    - in template it could be accessed::\n\n        {{ popup_forms.WriteMessageForm }}, etc. \n\n* Decorator to conditionally display popup form on page load\n  (for example, to fill in some missing information after registration/login)::\n\n      @show_popup_form('/account/register/details/',\n                       lambda request: 'register-details' in request.session)\n      def some_my_view(request):\n          ...\n\n\nUse case is following:\n\n* Template tags renders the form, together with link::\n\n      <a href=\"...\" onclick=\"open the form\">Link Title</a>\n      <div class=\"hidden_form\">\n          <form>...</form>\n      </div>\n\n* When user clicks on link, the form, already pre-loaded in template, just makes visible\n* User fills form, and submits it. POST request goes to form processing URL\n* If form is valid, it is processed, handler returns `CloseFormResponse`\n  to close the popup form, and user is redirected to success url\n  (which by default is the referrer page where popup form was rendered)\n* If form contains errors, handler returns `OpenFormResponse`,\n  it is handled by decorator, which stores form data AND ERROR DATA\n  in session, and redirects back to referring view\n* The ``{% popup_form %}`` tag then finds data, stored by decorator,\n  and re-populates form making it VISIBLE (not hidden) - user\n  sees the same form, with errors\n\nConditions\n----------\n\nThere is no separate template to be rendered by form processing view.\nThat's why form processing view should not render anything: it just porcesses forms,\nand makes redirects. If the view renders something, the decorator raises exception.\n\nDisadvantages\n-------------\n\n* If there are many links in the page, for each link a separate form is rendered hiddenly.\n  However, HTML of the form does not take much space (less than 1000 characters)\n\n* Right now we have problem to scroll page to the same position\n  after re-populating form with errors, but it can be resolved",
