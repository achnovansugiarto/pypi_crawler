    "description": "MapIt\n=====\n\nMapIt is an open source project to help people run a web service that maps\ngeographical points to administrative areas. It is useful for anyone who has\nthe co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs to find out what country,\nregion, city, constituency, or state it lies within. Itâ€™s also great for\nlooking up the shapes of all those boundaries.\n\nIt was created in 2003 by `mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org/>`__, a UK\ncharity, for use by their various tools needing admin area lookup.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. For full\ndetails, please see our site at http://code.mapit.mysociety.org/ for help\nand documentation.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n`mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org>`__ runs public installations of MapIt that\nyou might be able to use:\n\n    * `MapIt Global <http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - global boundaries\n      from the `OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ project.\n    * `MapIt UK <http://mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - UK boundaries from various\n      sources.\n\nThe above are free for non-commercial, low-volume use. For details of\nwhat constitutes \"low-volume\", and for commercial licensing arrangements,\nplease consult `MapIt Usage and Licensing\n<http://mapit.mysociety.org/licensing>`_ .\n\n\nRate limiting\n-------------\n\nUsage is rate limited by default; clients may be rate limited by IP address\nor by a User Token passed in the User-Agent: header. Clients may be excluded\nfrom the effects of rate limiting via the RATE_LIMIT option in the\nconfiguration file.",
