    "description": "=====\nDjango Tribe Client\n=====\n\nTribe client is a simple `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/>`_ app\nto connect your server to the 'Tribe' web service (located at\nhttps://tribe.greenelab.com).\n\nThis python package allows web servers created using django to connect directly\nto Tribe and make use of its resources. Users of the client web server can\nlogin to access their Tribe resources via Tribe `OAuth2 <http://oauth.net/2/>`_\nauthentication.\n\n\nDownload and Install\n---------------------\nTribe-client is registered as \"django-tribe-client\" in PyPI and is pip\ninstallable:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n\tpip install django-tribe-client\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n---------------------\n\n\n1. Add ``tribe_client`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'tribe_client',\n    )\n\n\n2. Include the tribe-client URLconf in your project's URLconf (usually\n``urls.py``):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from django.conf.urls import url, patterns, include\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n      ...\n      (r'^tribe_client/', include('tribe_client.urls')),\n    )\n\n\n3. Register your client server at\nhttps://tribe.greenelab.com/oauth2/applications/. Make sure to:\n\n  a. Be logged-in using your Tribe account\n  b. Select \"Confidential\" under ``Client type`` and\n  c. Select \"Authorization Code\" under ``Authorization grant type``\n  d. Enter your client server's address plus \"/tribe_client/get_token\" in the ``Redirect uris`` box. If your client server's current address is http://example.com, enter **http://example.com/tribe_client/get_token**\n\n  .. note:: Currently, Tribe supports the following ``Authorization grant types``:\n\n      * Authorization code\n      * Resource owner password-based\n\n    and does not support the following:\n\n      * Implicit\n      * Client credentials\n\n\n4. Write down the Client ID in the ``TRIBE_ID`` setting and the Client secret\nin the ``TRIBE_SECRET`` setting in your ``settings.py`` file like so:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    TRIBE_ID = '*****Tribe Client ID*****'\n    TRIBE_SECRET = '*****Tribe Client Secret*****'\n\n\n5. The ``TRIBE_REDIRECT_URI`` setting should be the address of the client\nserver plus \"/tribe_client/get_token\".\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    TRIBE_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://example.com/tribe_client/get_token'\n\n\n6. Make sure that you have a ``base.html`` template that the tribe_client\ntemplates can extend\n\n\n7. Make a link that takes the user to the ``/tribe_client`` url of your website\nfor them to log in using Tribe\n\n\nA Closer Look\n-----------------------------\n\nUnder the hood, tribe-client has functions that:\n\n1) Get an access token (via the `OAuth2 <http://oauth.net/2/>`_ protocol) that\nallows users to access and create resources in Tribe.\n\n2) Retrieves public and private collections (and their versions) and displays\nthem on the client server using views and templates included in the package.\n\n3) Allows users to create new collections and versions remotely, from the\nclient server.",
