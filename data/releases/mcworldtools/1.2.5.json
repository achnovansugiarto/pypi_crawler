    "description": "# MCWorldTools\n\n[![PyPi Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mcworldtools.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/mcworldtools/)\n[![PyPI pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mcworldtools.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/mcworldtools/)\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Rapha149/MCWorldTools.svg?style=flat-square&logo=github&label=Stars&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Rapha149/MCWorldTools/)\n\nUseful tools for Minecraft worlds such as removing unused chunks and finding blocks, command blocks or entities.  \nTested from `1.7.10` up to `1.18.2`.\n\n## Installation\n```pip install mcworldtools```\n\n## Usage\nYou can simply run the command `mcworldtools` in a Minecraft world folder.  \nThe script will tell you the name of your Minecraft world and - if possible, it may not be in older versions - the Minecraft version of your world.  \nAfter that you can choose which tool you want to use by stating the number of the tool.\n\n### Warning\nDo **NOT** use these tools for a world that is currently opened (i.e. in Minecraft Singleplayer or by a Minecraft server).\nDoing so may lead to unintended consequences. I do NOT take any responsibility for your Minecraft world if you do that.\n\n### Further usage\n```mcworldtools [-h] [-w WORLD] [-t TOOL] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-f {plain,json,yaml}] [--confirm]```\n\n### Arguments\n- `-h --help` Show the help message and exit.\n- `-v --version` Show the installed version and exit.\n- `-w WORLD, --world WORLD` Use a different world folder than the current working directory. You can provide this option multiple times for multiple words.\n- `-t TOOL, --tool TOOL` Choose the tool to use beforehand.\n- `-o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE` Select a file to write the output statistics to. This option is mandatory when searching for something.\n- `-f {plain,json,yaml}, --output-format {plain,json,yaml}` The output file format. May be `plain` (default), `json` or `yaml`.\n- `-i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE` Select a file to read input values from. See [below](#input-files) for more information.\n- `--confirm` Automatically confirm any confirmation requests.\n\n### Dimension notes\nYou can state dimensions in input files or when you are asked for locations when removing blocks or command blocks.  \nDimensions will be returned when finding blocks, command blocks or entities.  \nA dimension may be one of `overworld`, `nether` or `end`.\nPlease note that when using this tool on server worlds where nether and end are in seperate folders (`world_nether` and `world_the_end`) and you are executing the script on one of these, the dimension will be `overworld` because there is no way of detecting to which dimension the world folder is belonging.  \nThe dimensions `nether` and `end` will only be used if the nether and end files are in a folder named `WORLD_FOLDER/DIM-1` (nether) or `WORLD_FOLDER/DIM1` (end).\n\n### Input files\nThe content of the input files stated in the command have to be in valid json format.  \nYou don't have to specify anything in the input file, but you won't get asked for something that you specified. That is useful for automated tasks.\n\nHere is what you can change with these input files:\n\n#### Remove unused chunks\n```json\n{\n  \"inhabited_time\": 0\n}\n```\n- `inhabited_time` - The time for how long a player may have been in a chunk for it to be deleted (in seconds). Defaults to 0.\n\n#### Find/remove command blocks\n##### Possibility 1: Finding command blocks\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 1,\n  \"only_executing\": false,\n  \"dimension\": \"overworld\"\n}\n```\n- `action` - `1` for finding command blocks.\n- `only_executing` - If enabled, only command blocks that are either powered or in automatic mode will be found.\n- `dimension` - The dimension in which command blocks should be searched. Set to `null` for all dimensions. See [dimension notes](#dimension-notes) for more information.\n\n##### Possibility 2: Removing command blocks\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 2,\n  \"locations\": [\n    {\n      \"dimension\": \"overworld\",\n      \"x\": 3,\n      \"y\": 72,\n      \"z\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"dimension\": \"nether\",\n      \"x\": 5,\n      \"y\": 129,\n      \"z\": 200\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n- `action` - `2` for removing command blocks.\n- `locations` - A list of locations where command blocks should be removed. For `dimension` see the [dimension notes](#dimension-notes).\n\n#### Find/remove entities\n##### Possibility 1: Finding entities\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 1,\n  \"id\": \"minecraft:zombie\",\n  \"dimension\": \"overworld\",\n  \"nbt_keys\": [\"OnGround\", \"Age\"]\n}\n```\n- `action` - `1` for finding entities.\n- `id` - The entity id to filter entities. Set to `null` for all entities. You don't have to prepend it with `minecraft:`\n- `dimension` - The dimension in which entities should be searched. Set to `null` for all dimensions. See [dimension notes](#dimension-notes) for more information.\n- `nbt_keys` - A list of NBT keys to be included in the output. Set to `[]` (empty list) for all NBT keys. Set to `null` to not include any NBT keys.\n\n##### Possibility 2: Removing entities by id\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 2,\n  \"remove_by\": \"id\",\n  \"id\": \"minecraft:zombie\"\n}\n```\n- `action` - `2` for removing entities.\n- `remove_by` - `id` for removing by id.\n- `id` - The id of which entities should be removed.\n\n##### Possibility 3: Removing entities by uuid\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 2,\n  \"remove_by\": \"uuid\",\n  \"uuid\": \"325cdf04-8211-4f7d-8a47-79b291c1ca77\"\n}\n```\n- `action` - `2` for removing entities.\n- `remove_by` - `uuid` for removing by uuid.\n- `uuid` - The uuid of the entity to remove.\n\n##### Possibility 4: Removing all entities\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": 2,\n  \"remove_by\": \"all\"\n}\n```\n- `action` - `2` for removing entities.\n- `remove_by` - `all` for removing all entities.\n\n\n",
