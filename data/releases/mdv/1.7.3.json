Those can be combined for code vs regular markdown output...\n- Admonitions\n- Tables, incl. wide table handling avoiding \"interleaving\"\n- Somewhat hackable, all in [one](mdv/markdownviewer.py) module\n- Useable as lib as well\n- File change monitor\n- Text wrapping\n- Source code highlighter\n- Little directory change monitor (cames handy when working on multiple files, to get the current one always displayed)\n\t- which can run arbitrary commands on file changes\n\t- which passes filepath, raw and prettyfied content to the other command\n        Note: Poor man's implementation, polling. Check inotify based tools if you want sth better.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe ones I know of (and which made me write mdv ;-) ):\n\n1. There are quite a few from the js community (e.g. [msee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msee), ansidown, ansimd and also nd which is great) but they require nodejs & npm, which I don't have on my servers. Also I personally wanted table handling and admonition support throughout and prob. too old to hack other peoples' js (struggling enough with my own). But have a look at them, they do some things better than mdv in this early version (I try to learn from them). Also [this](https://github.com/substack/picture-tube) would be worth a look ;-)\n2. pandoc -> html -> elinks, lynx or pandoc -> groff -> man. (Heavy and hard to use from within other programs. Styling suboptimal)\n3. vimcat (Also heavy and hard to use inline in other programs)\n\nSummary: For production ready robust markdown viewing (e.g. for your customers) I recommend nd still, due to the early state of mdv. For playing around, especially with theming or when with Python, this one might be a valid alternative to look at.\n\n## Installation\n\n    pip install mdv\n\nIf you get `no attribute HTML_PLACEHOLDER`: update your markdown package.\n\n[Here](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/53591) is a macport (thanks Aljaž).\n\n\n### Manual Install: Requirements\n\n- python == 2.7 or > 3.5\n- py markdown (pip install markdown)\n- py pygments (pip install pygments)\n- py yaml (pip install pyyaml)\n- py docopt (pip install docopt)\n- py tabulate (pip install tabulate)\n\nFurther a 256 color terminal (for now best with dark background) and font support for a few special separator characters (which you could change via config).\n\n> For light terms you'd just need to revert the 5 colors from the themes, since they are sorted by luminocity.\n\nI did not test anything on windows.\n\n### Manual Install: Setup\n\nDistribution via setuptools. If setuptools is not installed, run:\n\n    pip install setuptools\n\n\nUse the setup.py provided inside, I.e. run:\n\n\tsudo ./setup.py install\n    (or ./setup.py install --user to install only for the current user)\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### CLI\n\n```markdown\n\n# Usage:\n\n    mdv [OPTIONS] MDFILE\n\n# Options:\n\n    MDFILE    : Path to markdown file\n    -A        : Strip all ansi (no colors then)\n    -C MODE   : Sourcecode highlighting mode\n    -H        : Print html version\n    -L        : Backwards compatible shortcut for '-u i'\n    -M DIR    : Monitor directory for markdown file changes\n    -T C_THEME: Theme for code highlight. If not set: Using THEME.\n    -X Lexer  : Default lexer name (default: python). Set -x to use it always.\n    -b TABL   : Set tab_length to sth. different than 4 [default: 4]\n    -c COLS   : Fix columns to this (default: your terminal width)\n    -f FROM   : Display FROM given substring of the file.\n    -h        : Show help\n    -i        : Show theme infos with output\n    -l        : Light background (not yet supported)\n    -m        : Monitor file for changes and redisplay FROM given substring\n    -n NRS    : Header numbering (default: off. Say e.g. -3 or 1- or 1-5\n    -t THEME  : Key within the color ansi_table.json. 'random' accepted.\n    -u STYL   : Link Style (it=inline table=default, h=hide, i=inline)\n    -x        : Do not try guess code lexer (guessing is a bit slow)\n\n\n# Notes:\n\nWe use stty tool to derive terminal size. If you pipe into mdv we use 80 cols.\n\n## To use mdv.py as lib:\n\nCall the main function with markdown string at hand to get a\nformatted one back. Sorry then for no Py3 support, accepting PRs if they don't screw Py2.\n\n## FROM:\n\nFROM may contain max lines to display, seperated by colon.\nExample:\n\n    -f 'Some Head:10' -> displays 10 lines after 'Some Head'\n\nIf the substring is not found we set it to the *first* character of the file -\nresulting in output from the top (if your terminal height can be derived correctly through the stty cmd).\n\n## Code Highlighting\n\nSet -C <all|code|doc|mod> for source code highlighting of source code files.\nMark inline markdown with a '_' following the docstring beginnings.\n\n- all: Show markdown docstrings AND code (default if you say, e.g. `-C.`)\n- code: Only Code\n- doc: Only docstrings with markdown\n- mod: Only the module level docstring\n\n\n## File Monitor:\n\nIf FROM is not found we display the whole file.\n\n## Directory Monitor:\n\nWe check only text file changes, monitoring their size.\n\nBy default .md, .mdown, .markdown files are checked but you can change like `-M 'mydir:py,c,md,'` where the last empty substrings makes mdv also monitor any file w/o extension (like 'README').\n\n### Running actions on changes:\n\nIf you append to `-M` a `'::<cmd>'` we run the command on any change detected (sync, in foreground).\n\nThe command can contain placeholders:\n\n    _fp_     # Will be replaced with filepath\n    _raw_    # Will be replaced with the base64 encoded raw content\n               of the file\n    _pretty_ # Will be replaced with the base64 encoded prettyfied output\n\nLike: mdv -M './mydocs:py,md::open \"_fp_\"'  which calls the open\ncommand with argument the path to the changed file.\n\n\n## Themes\n\n### Theme Rollers\n\n\n    mdv -T all [file]:  All available code styles on the given file.\n    mdv -t all [file]:  All available md   styles on the given file.\n                        If file is not given we use a short sample file.\n\nSo to see all code hilite variations with a given theme:\n\nSay C_THEME = all and fix THEME\n\nSetting both to all will probably spin your beach ball...\n\n### Environ Vars\n\n`$MDV_THEME` and `$MDV_CODE_THEME` are understood, e.g. `export\nMDV_THEME=729.8953` in your .bashrc will give you a consistent color scheme.\n\n\n```\n\n> Regarding the strange theme ids: Those numbers are the calculated total luminocity of the 5 theme colors.\n\n### Inline\n\nmdv is designed to be used well from other (Py2) programs when they have md at hand which should be displayed to the user:\n\n```python\nimport mdv\n\n# config like this:\nmdv.term_columns = 60\n\n# calling like this (all CLI options supported, check def main\nformatted = mdv.main(my_raw_markdown, c_theme=...)  \n```\n\n> Note that I set the defaultencoding to utf-8  in ``__main__``. I have this as my default python2 setup and did not test inline usage w/o. Check [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29832646/4583360) for risks.\n\n### Sample Inline Use Case: click module docu\n\n[Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode/)'s\n[click](http://click.pocoo.org) is a great framework for writing larger CLI apps - but its help texts are a bit boring, intended to be customized.\n\nHere is how:\n\nWrite a normal click module with a function but w/o a doc string as shown:\n```python\n@pass_context                                                                   \ndef cli(ctx, action, name, host, port, user, msg):           \n\t\"\"\" docu from module __doc__ \"\"\"\n```\n\nOn module level you provide markdown for it, like:\n\n```shell\n~/axc/plugins/zodb_sub $ cat zodb.py | head\n\"\"\"\n# Fetch and push ZODB trees\n\n## ACTION: < info | pull | push | merge | dump | serve>\n\n- info:  Requests server availability information\n(...)\n```\nwhich you set at click module import time:\n\n\tmod.cli.help = mod.__doc__\n\n\nLastly do this in your app module:\n\n```python\nfrom click.formatting import HelpFormatter\ndef write_text(self, text):\n    \"\"\" since for markdown pretty out on cli I found no good tool\n\tso I built my own \"\"\"\n    # poor man's md detection:\n    if not text.strip().startswith('#'):\n        return orig_write_text(self, text)\n    from axc.markdown.mdv import main as mdv\n    self.buffer.append(mdv(md=text, theme=os.environ['AXC_THEME']))\n\nHelpFormatter.orig_write_text = HelpFormatter.write_text\nHelpFormatter.write_text = write_text\n```\n\nThe output has then colors:\n\n![](samples/3.png)\n\nand at smaller terms rewraps nicely:\n\n![](samples/4.png)\n\nFurther, having markdown in the module ``__doc__`` makes it simple to add into a global project docu framework, like mkdocs.\n\n\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can supply all CLI args in `$HOME/.mdv`, in yaml format.\n\nMore flex you have via `$HOME/.mdv.py`, which is execed if present, when\nrunning `main`.\n\nAlternatively, in [mdv.py](mdv.py) you can change some config straight forward.\n\n```python\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Config\ntxt_block_cut, code_pref, list_pref, br_ends = '✂', '| ', '- ', '◈'\n# ansi cols (default):\n# R: Red (warnings), L: low visi, BG: background, BGL: background light, C=code\n# H1 - H5 = the theme, the numbers are the ansi color codes:\nH1,  H2,  H3,  H4,  H5, R,   L,  BG, BGL, T,   TL, C   = \\\n231, 153, 117, 109, 65, 124, 59, 16, 188, 188, 59, 102\n# Code (C is fallback if we have no lexer). Default: Same theme:\nCH1, CH2, CH3, CH4, CH5 = H1, H2, H3, H4, H5\n\ncode_hl = { \"Keyword\" : 'CH3', \"Name\" : 'CH1',\n            \"Comment\" : 'L',  \"String\": 'CH4',\n            \"Error\"   : 'R',  \"Number\": 'CH4',\n            \"Operator\": 'CH5',\n            \"Generic\" : 'CH2'\n            }\n\nadmons = {'note'     : 'H3', 'warning': 'R',\n          'attention': 'H1', 'hint'   : 'H4',\n          'summary'  : 'H1', 'hint'   : 'H4',\n          'question' : 'H5', 'danger' : 'R',\n          'caution'  : 'H2'\n         }\n\ndef_lexer = 'python'\nguess_lexer = True\n# also global. but not in use, BG handling can get pretty involved...\nbackground = BG\n\n# normal text color:\ncolor = T\n\nshow_links = None\n\n# could be given, otherwise read from ansi_tables.json:\nthemes = {}\n\n\n# sample for the theme roller feature:\nmd_sample = ''\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------ End Config\n```\n\nAny importing module can overwrite those module global variables as well.\n\nShould you need yet additional themes, add them to ``ansi_tables.json`` file by adding your ansi codes there.\n\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\nRandom results, using the theme roller feature:\n\n![second](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer/blob/master/samples/2.png)\n\nNote the table block splitting when the table does not fit (last picture).\n\n## TODO\n\n- Refactor the implementation, using a config class\n- Lines separators not optimal ([nd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nd) does better)\n- Test light colorscheme\n- Dimming\n- A few grey scale and 8 color themes\n- Sorting of the json by luminance\n- Some themes have black as darkest color, change to dark grey\n- Common Mark instead of markdown\n\n## PerfTests\n\nRendering this readme [100 times](./mdv/misc/perftest.py):\n```\nblack root@ip-10-34-2-19:~/terminal_markdown_viewer/mdv/misc# python perfest.py\n0.03 paka\n0.04 paka_breaks\n0.04 paka_xml\n1.47 mistletoe\n8.70 markdown\n5.22 commonmark\n```\n- markdown did better than commonmark w/o extensions but table and fenced code\nare definitelly required for 99% users.\n\n- paka is a wrapper around the C reference lib -> requires compilation.\n\n- mistletoe is pure python, crazy that they are so much faster than CommonMark.\nThey say in pypy they are speed up even much more.\n\nmistletoe downside: py2 only via a fork.\n\n\n## Credits\n\n[pygments](http://pygments.org/) (using their lexer)\n\n[tabulate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate)\n\nand, naturally, the [python markdown project](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/authors.html)\n\nUpdate: Next version will be CommonMark based though...\n\n\n## Updates\n\n### July 2016:\n\nSort of an excuse for the long long time w/o an update:\nI did actually start working on a more solid version based on CommonMark but\nthat went a bit out of scope, into a general html terminal viewer, which will\nprobably never be finished :-/\n\nSo at least here an update containing the stuff you guys sent as PRs, thanks all!!\n\n- installation and dependencies via a setup.py (thanks\n  [Martin](https://github.com/althonos))\n- supporting `echo -e \"# foo\\n## bar\" | mdv -` and a 'light' theme (thanks\n  [Stanislav](https://github.com/seletskiy))\n- and a few other improvements regarding python2.7, file location and pyyaml, thanks all.\n\nAlso:\n\n- fixed the most obvious bugs with nested ordered and unordered lists\n- fixed bold marker\n- different color highlighting for the list markers\n- added a source code highlighting mode, which highlights also docstrings in markdown (`-C <mode>`)\n- some tests in the tests folder\n- using `textwrap` now for the wrapping, to avoid these word breaks a few complained about\n- you can supply the default lexer now, e.g. `-X javascript [-x]`\n- fixed but with not rendered strong texts\n- pip install mdv\n\n\n### Nov 2016:\n\n- travis\n\n- Inline link tables\n\n![](samples/links.png)\n\n\n\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer\n[travis_img]: https://travis-ci.org/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer.svg?branch=master\n\n\n\n### Sept 2018:\n\n- Merged some PRs. \n- Decent [code formatter](https://github.com/ambv/black). Not that this weekend hack got more readable though. Well, maybe a bit.\n- Revised Py3 support (finally found peace with it, since they enforce UTF-8 everywhere the new features begin to outweigh the nightmares of trying to decode everything without need).\n- Indented code in PY3 was broken, fixed that. *Why, PY3, are you you creating crap like \"b'foo'\" instead raising or auto-decoding?*\n- Header numbering feature added (`-n 2-4` or `-n 1-`)\n<img src=\"https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer/blob/master/samples/header_num.png\" width=\"400\"/>",
