    "description": "Django-Select2\n==============\n\nThis is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) integration of [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/).\n\nThe app includes Select2 driven Django Widgets and Form Fields.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n1. Install `django_select2`\n\n        pip install django_select2\n\n2. Add `django_select2` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your project settings.\n\n3. When deploying on production server, run :-\n\n        python manage.py collectstatic\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation available at http://django-select2.readthedocs.org/.\n\nMore details\n============\n\nMore details can be found on my blog at - http://blog.applegrew.com/2012/08/django-select2/.\n\nExternal Dependencies\n=====================\n\n* Django - This is obvious.\n* jQuery - This is not included in the package since it is expected that in most scenarios this would already be available.\n\nExample Application\n===================\nPlease see `testapp` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.\n\nYou need only Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n==============\n\n* Samuel Goldszmidt (@ouhouhsami) for reporting many fundamental issues with the code, because of which versions 2.0 and 2.0.1 were released.\n\nChangelog Summary\n=================\n\n### v3.0.1\n\n* Revised the design of heavy fields. The previous design didn't quite make it easy to back heavy fields by big data sources. See `fields.HeavyChoiceField` class and its methods' docs for more info.\n* Updated docs.\n* Some more fixes for issue#4.\n* Updated Select2 JS to version 3.1.\n\n### v3.0\n\n* Added docs.\n* Some bug fixes. See issue#4.\n* `widgets.Select2Mixin.__init__` now accepts `select2_options` kwarg to override its `options` settings. Previously `attrs` were being used for this too. This means backward compatibility has been broken here. `attrs` will no longer override `options` values. **The major release version has been changed to 3, because of this backward incompatible change.**\n\n### v2.0.1\n\n* Auto id registration fixes.\n\n### v2.0\n\n* Mostly major bug fixes in code and design. The changes were many, raising the possibility of backward incompatibility. However, the backward incompatibility would be subtle.\n\n* Auto fields (sub-classes of AutoViewFieldMixin) now accepts `auto_id` parameter. This can be used to provide custom id for the field. The default is 'module.field_class_name'. Ideally only the first instance of an auto field is registered. This parameter can be used to force registration of additional instances by passing a unique value.",
