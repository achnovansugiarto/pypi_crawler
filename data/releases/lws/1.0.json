The easiest way to install `lws` is via `pip`:  \n\n        .. code-block:: bash\n\n            pip install lws\n\n2. To compile from source using cython (required if one modifies the code):  \n\n        .. code-block:: bash\n\n            cd python\n            LWS_USE_CYTHON=1 make \n\n3. To compile from source using the pre-generated c source file (which was obtained with cython): \n\n        .. code-block:: bash\n\n            cd python\n            make\n\n4. Alternatively, one can first use cython to create a tarball, which can then be installed by pip:  \n\n        .. code-block:: bash\n\n            cd python\n            make sdist\n            pip install dist/lws-1.0.tar.gz\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n.. code:: python\n\n    import lws\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    lws_processor=lws.lws(512,128, mode=\"speech\") # 512: window length; 128: window shift\n    X = lws_processor.stft(x) # where x is a single-channel waveform\n    X0 = np.abs(X) # Magnitude spectrogram\n    print('{:6}: {:5.2f} dB'.format('Abs(X)', lws_processor.get_consistency(X0))\n    X1 = lws_processor.run_lws(X0) # reconstruction from magnitude (in general, one can reconstruct from an initial complex spectrogram)\n    print('{:6}: {:5.2f} dB'.format('LWS', lws_processor.get_consistency(X1)))\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    lws_processor=lws.lws(awin_or_fsize, fshift, L = 5, swin = None, look_ahead = 3,\n              nofuture_iterations = 0, nofuture_alpha = 1, nofuture_beta = 0.1, nofuture_gamma = 1,\n              online_iterations = 0, online_alpha = 1, online_beta = 0.1, online_gamma = 1,\n              batch_iterations = 100, batch_alpha = 100, batch_beta = 0.1, batch_gamma = 1,\n              symmetric_win = True, mode= None, stft_opts = {})\n\n* ``awin_or_fsize``: either the analysis window, or a window length (in which case the sqrt(hann) window is used)\n* ``fshift``: window shift\n* ``L``: approximation order in the phase reconstruction algorithm, 5 should be good.\n* ``swin``: synthesis window (if None, it gets computed from the analysis window for perfect reconstruction)\n* ``look_ahead``: number of look-ahead frames in RTISI-LA-like algorithm, 3 should be good.\n* ``xxx_iterations``, ``xxx_alpha``, ``xxx_beta``, ``xxx_gamma``: number of iterations of algorithm xxx (where xxx is one of ``nofuture``, ``online``, or ``batch``), and parameters alpha/beta/gamma of the decreasing sparsity curve that is used to determine which bins get updated at each iteration. Any bin with magnitude larger than a given threshold is updated, others are ignored (``thresholds = alpha * np.exp(- beta * np.arange(iterations)**gamma)``)\n* ``symmetric_win``: determines whether to use a symmetric hann window or not\n* ``mode``: ``None``, ``'speech'``, or ``'music'``. This sets default numbers of iterations of each algorithm that seem to be good for speech and music signals. Disclaimer: your mileage may vary.\n* ``stft_opts``: ``{'perfectrec':True,'fftsize':self.fsize}``. ``perfectrec``: whether to pad with zeros on each side to ensure perfect reconstruction at the boundaries too. ``fftsize``: can be set longer than frame size to do 0-padding in the FFT.\n\nThree steps are implemented, and they can be turned on/off independently by appropriately setting the corresponding number of iterations:\n\n* \"no future\" LWS: phase initialization using LWS updates that only involve past frames\n* online LWS: phase estimation using online LWS updates, corresponding to a fast time-frequency domain version of RTISI-LA\n* LWS: phase estimation using batch LWS updates on the whole spectrogram\n\n\nRemarks\n-------\n\n1) The .cpp files are actually C code with some C99 style comments, but the .cpp extension is needed on Windows for mex to acknowledge the c99 flag (with .c, it is discarded, and -ansi used instead, leading to compilation errors)\n\n2) Because the module is a C extension, it cannot be reloaded (see <http://bugs.python.org/issue1144263>). In Jupyter Notebooks, in particular, autoreload will not work, and the kernel has to be restarted.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThe recipe to wrap the LWS C code as a python module was largely inspired by the following post by Martin Sosic: <http://martinsosic.com/development/2016/02/08/wrapping-c-library-as-python-module.html>\n",
