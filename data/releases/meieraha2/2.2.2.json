    "description": "==================================================================\nMeieraha.ee visualization website source\n==================================================================\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDepending on how you obtain the package, you may install it in different ways. If the package was obtained as a source distribution,\nyou should install it using ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install meieraha2-<version>.zip\n\nIf you checked out a development repository, you may install the package by running::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nIf you are planning on developing the package, a useful alternative to installation is::\n\n    $ python setup.py develop\n\nor, if you do not have write access to your Python installation and are not using a virtualenv::\n\n    $ python setup.py develop --user\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe package contains a `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_-based web application. To launch the application you need to do the following:\n\n    1. Run::\n\n       $ meieraha2-manage sampleconfig\n\n    2. Follow the instructions output by the command.\n\nTo create a packaged distribution you need to run the following::\n\n       $ meieraha2-manage assets build\n       $ python setup.py sdist\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIn order to run the application in development mode you need to have a full repository checked out. You also\nshould have the ``compass`` tool installed and accessible in your path. The server can then be run in development mode as follows::\n\n    $ export CONFIG=meieraha2.config.DevConfig\n    $ meieraha2-manage createdb\n    $ meieraha2-manage loaddata\n    $ meieraha2-manage runserver\n\nIf you edit CSS or Javascript files, you will need to rebuild the assets bundle via\n\n    $ meieraha2-manage assets build\n\nDeployment\n-----------\n\nThere is a starter Fabric configuration file `fabfile.py` which may help automate deployment. It needs tayloring before used, though. Sample deployment configuration is in `deploy/aws`.\n\nCopyright\n-----------\n \n - The code was developed by Konstantin Tretyakov and Tanel Kärp with the help from many other people on the Meieraha team (see http://meieraha.ee)\n - The code is licensed as MIT, feel free to contribute.\n - The repository includes full distributions of some external libraries (to simplify deployment). Those are subject to their own licences. All are open source, though.\n\n ",
