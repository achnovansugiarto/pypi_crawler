Executing `micropy init <PROJECT NAME>`\n2. Selecting your target device/firmware\n3. Boom. Your workspace is ready.\n\n### Stub Management\n\nStub files are the magic behind how micropy allows features such as linting, Intellisense, and autocompletion to work. To achieve the best results with MicropyCli, its important that you first add the appropriate stubs for the device/firmware your project uses.\n\n#### Adding Stubs\n\nAdding stubs to Micropy is a breeze. Simply run: `micropy stubs add <STUB_NAME>`\nBy sourcing [micropy-stubs](https://github.com/BradenM/micropy-stubs), MicroPy has several premade stub packages to choose from.\n\nThese packages generally use the following naming schema:\n\n`<device>-<firmware>-<version>`\n\nFor example, running `micropy stubs add esp32-micropython-1.11.0` will install the following:\n* Micropython Specific Stubs\n* ESP32 Micropython v1.11 Device Specific Stubs\n* Frozen Modules for both device and firmware\n\nYou can search stubs that are made available to Micropy via `micropy stubs search <QUERY>`\n\nAlternatively, using `micropy stubs add <PATH>`, you can manually add stubs to Micropy.\nFor manual stub generation, please see [Josvel/micropython-stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber).\n\n#### Creating Stubs\n\nUsing `micropy stubs create <PORT/IP_ADDRESS>`, MicropyCli can automatically generate and add stubs from any Micropython device you have on hand. This can be done over both USB and WiFi.\n\n\n#### Viewing Stubs\n\nTo list stubs you have installed, simply run `micropy stubs list`.\n\nTo search for stubs for your device, use `micropy stubs search <QUERY>`.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n### Micropython-Stubber\n[Josvel/micropython-stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber)\n\nJosverl's Repo is full of information regarding Micropython compatibility with VSCode and more. To find out more about how this process works, take a look at it.\n\nmicropy-cli and [micropy-stubs](https://github.com/BradenM/micropy-stubs) depend on micropython-stubber for its ability to generate frozen modules, create stubs on a pyboard, and more.\n\n\n",
