If you have any problem you can contact me on my E-mail at the last of this Document. For any Help we also have YouTube channel link is at the last of this file.\n\n\n# Training Your Own Model\n\nFor Training Your Own Model You have to Create Your Dataset.\nFor example record 10 audio with voice **Activate** and place it under \"Positives folder\" and record 10 **Non-Activate Word ** Which are not Activate and place it under negatives folder.\nand Then run this command\n```console \npip install lsHotword\n```\nThen go to your python library where **ls Hotword is installed** and run this command.\n```\npython Htrainer.py --input ./data --epochs 100\n\n```\nHere **data** is the folder where both folders **\"positives and negatives\"** are located and training with 100 epochs.\n\n\n# Using Trained Model\n\n\nIn the installed directory you find a python file **ls.py** you have to open this file in your code editor and change model path and save it.\nNow you had done all things and now go to any directory and create any python file and use this hotword detector like this:\n\n```\nimport ls\n#type any code \n#call your Hotword like this\n\nls.lsHotword_loop()           #code stoped at this line and resume if you\n                         #speak your Wake Word\n\n```\n\n# For More Information\n\nFor more information or send your query at:\niamhemantindia@protonmail.com\n\nor Checkout Our Youtube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/LogicalSpot\n\n",
