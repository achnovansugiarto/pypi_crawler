But to send emails from a site without a lot of traffic, or to\nrun other similar simple tasks, you don't need Celery.\n\nThis queue app is a simple, up and running queueing solution. The more\ncomplex distributed queues can wait until the website has a lot of\ntraffic, and the scalability is really required.\n\nIn addition, the django_queue_manager provides a simple and stunning easy-to-use interface in the admin backend page\n\n\n## <a name=\"Overview\"></a>Overview:\n\n\nIn a nutshell, a python SocketServer runs in the background, and listens\nto a tcp socket. SocketServer gets the request to run a task from it's\nsocket, puts the task on a Queue. A Worker thread picks tasks from this\nQueue, and runs the tasks one by one.\n\nThe SocketServer istance can be one or multiple, depending on your app requirements.\n\nYou send a task request to the default SocketServer with:\n\n\n    from mysite.django_queue_manager.API import push_task_to_queue\n    ...\n    push_task_to_queue(a_callable, *args, **kwargs)\n\nSending email might look like:\n\n    push_task_to_queue(send_mail,subject=\"foo\",message=\"baz\",recipient_list=[user.email])\n\nIf you have more of one SocketServer istance, you can specify the parameter dqmqueue, in order to send the task to another queue, like below:\n\n\tspecific_queue = DQMQueue.objects.get(description='foo_queue')\n    push_task_to_queue(send_mail,subject=\"foo\",message=\"baz\",recipient_list=[user.email], dqmqueue=specific_queue)\n\n### Components:\n\n1. Python SocketServer that listens to a tcp socket.\n2. A Worker thread.\n3. A python Queue\n\n### Workflow:\n\nThe workflow that runs an async task:\n\n1. When ``SocketServer`` starts, it initializes the ``Worker`` thread.\n2. ``SocketServer`` listens to requests.\n3. When ``SocketServer`` receives a request - a callables with args and kwargs - it puts the request on a python ``Queue``.\n4. The ``Worker`` thread picks a task from the ``Queue``.\n5. The ``Worker`` thread runs the task.\n\n\n### Can this queue scale to production?:\n\nAbsolutely!: SocketServer is simple, but solid, and as the\nsite gets more traffic, it's possible to move the django_queue_manager server to\nanother machine, separate database, use multiple istance of SocketServer, etc...\nAt some point, probably, it's better to pick Celery. Until then, django_queue_manager is a simple, solid, and\nno-hustle solution.\n\n\n## <a name=\"Install\"></a>Install:\n\n1. Install the django_queue_manager with the following pip command ``pip3 install django_queue_manager``.\n\n2. Add ``django_queue_manager`` in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list.\n\n3. Migrate:\n\n       $ manange.py migrate\n\n4. The django_queue_manager app has an API module, with a ``push_task_to_queue``\n   function. Use this function to send callables with args and kwargs to the queue,\n   you can specify a specific queue with the parameter dqmqueue or use the default one if none it's specified, for the async run.\n\n## <a name=\"Settings\"></a>Settings:\n\n\nTo change the default django_queue_manager settings, you can modify the backend default queue present in the django admin pages.\n\nIn a glance, the queue, has the following parameters:\n\n**description** The description of the queue.\n\n**queue\\_host** The host to run the SocketServer. The default is\n'localhost'. (It can be also a remote host)\n\n**queue\\_port**\nThe port that SocketServer listens to. The default is\n8002.\n\n**max\\_retries** The number of times the Worker thread will try to run a\ntask before skipping it. The default is 3.\n\n\nSo, in a nutshell, for using multiple queues, simply add a new queue\nin the admin page and pass the istance of a valid ``DQMQueue`` object in the function like below:\n\n\n\n    from mysite.django_queue_manager.API import push_task_to_queue\n    ...\n\tspecific_queue = DQMQueue.objects.get(description='foo_queue')\n    push_task_to_queue(send_mail,subject=\"foo\",message=\"baz\",recipient_list=[user.email], dqmqueue=specific_queue)\n\n\n## <a name=\"Run-the-Tasks-Queue-Server\"></a>Run the Tasks Queue Server:\n\n\n### Start the Server:\n\nFrom shell or a process control system, run the following script with python >= 3\n(if you use a VirtualEnv, specify the environment path in supervisor conf.d file):\n\n\n\n    import os\n\tos.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"YOUR-APP-NAME.settings\")\n\timport django\n\tdjango.setup()\n\timport time\n\tfrom django_queue_manager import worker_manager\n\tfrom django_queue_manager.models import DQMQueue\n\tfrom django_queue_manager.server_manager import TaskSocketServerThread\n\tworker_manager.start()\n\tserver_thread = TaskSocketServerThread('localhost', DQMQueue.objects.first().queue_port)\n\ttime.sleep(5)\n\tsocket_server = server_thread.socket_server()\n\tsocket_server.serve_forever()\n\n\n*Note: You have to change the variable \"YOUR-APP-NAME.settings\" with the\nname of your app, like that: \"email_sender.settings\")*\n\n\n### The Shell interface:\n\n\ndjango_queue_manager, provides a simple script called ``shell.py``\nthat it's useful in order to see how the queue, worker and server it's going on,\nthe base syntax it's really simple\n\n\n\n    $ python <package-install-dir>/shell.py queue-host queue-port command\n\n### Stop the server:\n\nTo stop the worker thread gracefully:\n\n\n\n    $ python django_queue_manager/shell.py localhost 8002 stop\n    Sent: ping\n    Received: (False, 'Worker Off')\n\nThis will send a stop event to the Worker thread. Check that the Worker\nthread stopped:\n\n\n\n    $ python django_queue_manager/shell.py localhost 8002 ping\n    Sent: ping\n    Received: (False, 'Worker Off')\n\nNow you can safely stop SocketServer:\n\n\n\n    $ ps ax | grep django_queue_manager\n    12345 pts/1 S 7:20 <process name>\n    $ sudo kill 12345\n\n### Ping the server:\nFrom shell:\n\n    $ python django_queue_manager/shell.py localhost 8002 ping\n    Sent: ping\n    Received: (True, \"I'm OK\")\n\n### Tasks that are waiting on the Queue:\n\nFrom shell:\n\n    $ python django_queue_manager/shell.py localhost 8002 waiting\n    Sent: waiting\n    Received: (True, 115)\n\n115 tasks are waiting on the queue\n\n### Count total tasks handled to the Queue\n\nFrom shell:\n\n\n\n    $ python django_queue_manager/shell.py localhost 8002 handled\n    Sent: handled\n    Received: (True, 862)\n\nTotal of 862 tasks were handled to the Queue from the moment the thread\nstarted\n\n*Note: If you use the tasks server commands a lot, add shell aliases for\nthese commands*\n\n\n\n\n## <a name=\"Persistency\"></a>Persistency:\n\n### *Tasks are saved in the database: why not! you already have a DB!*\n\n**QueuedTasks** The model saves every tasks pushed to the queue and not yet processed.\nThe task is pickled as a ``django_queue_manager.task_manager.Task`` object, which is a\nsimple class with a ``callable``, ``args``, ``dqmqueue`` and ``kwargs`` attributes,\nand one method: ``run()``. \n\n*After a successful execution, the QueuedTasks will be deleted and moved into the ``SuccessTask`` queue.*\n\n*Note: If you use the requeue task function in the django admin dropdown action, the\nselected tasks will be requeued like NEW TASKS (with a new ``task_id``) in the ``QueuedTasks`` table.*\n\n**SuccessTasks** The Worker thread saves to this model the successfully executed job\nwith all informations like above:\n\n``task_function_name``: The complete function name like \"module.function_name\"\n\n``task_args``: The variable list arguments in plain text\n\n``task_kwargs``: The dictionary arguments in plain text\n\n``task_id``: The task id carried from the initial QueuedTask istance\n\n``success_on``: The success datetime\n\n``pickled_task``: The complete pickled task\n\n``dqmqueue``: The reference of the dqmqueue queue istance\n\n**FailedTasks** After the Worker tries to run a task several times\naccording to ``max_retries``(specified in the dqmqueue used), and the task still fails, the Worker saves it to this model with all informations like above:\n\n``task_function_name``: The complete function name like \"module.function_name\"\n\n``task_args``: The variable list arguments in plain text\n\n``task_kwargs``: The dictionary arguments in plain text\n\n``task_id``: The task id carried from the initial QueuedTask istance\n\n``failed_on``: The last failed run datetime\n\n``exception``: The exception message, only the exception from the last run is saved.\n\n``pickled_task``: The complete pickled task\n\n``dqmqueue``: The reference of the dqmqueue queue istance\n\n*Note: If you use the requeue task function in the django admin dropdown action, the\nselected tasks will be requeued like NEW TASKS (with a new ``task_id``) in the ``QueuedTasks`` table.*\n\n### Purge Tasks:\n\nAccording to your project needs, you can purge tasks using the django admin\ninterface or manually with a query execution.\n\nIn a similar way, delete the failed/success tasks. You can run a cron script, or\nother script, to purge the tasks.\n\n### Connections:\n\nIf most of the tasks require a specific connection, such as SMTP or a\ndatabase, you can subclass (...or edit directly) the Worker class and add a ping or other check\nfor this connection **before** the tasks runs. If the connection is\nnot avaialable, just try to re-connect.\n\nOtherwise the Worker will just run and fail a lot of tasks.\n\n<a name=\"Run-the-Tasks-Queue-on-Another-Server\"></a>Run the Tasks Queue on Another Server:\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe same ``django_queue_manager`` app can run from another server, and provide a\nseprate server queue for the async tasks.\n\nHere is a simple way to do it:\n\n1. The queue server should be similar to the main django server, just\n   without a webserver.\n2. Deploy your django code to these two remotes: the main with the\n   web-server, and the queue server\n3. Open firewalls ports between the main django server, and the queue\n   server, and between the main django database and the queue server host\n4. On the django main server, change the host and port details directly from the admin site.\n\nThat's it!\nFor any support/issue request, contact the author: fardella.simone@gmail.com\n\n\n",
