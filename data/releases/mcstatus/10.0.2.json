Specifically, mcstatus retrieves data by using these protocols: [Server List Ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping) and [Query](https://wiki.vg/Query). Because of mcstatus, you do not need to fully understand those protocols and can instead skip straight to retrieving minecraft server data quickly in your own programs.\n\n## Installation\n\nMcstatus is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/), and can be installed trivially with:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install mcstatus\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Python API\n\n#### Java Edition\n\n```python\nfrom mcstatus import JavaServer\n\n# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function\n# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use JavaServer(\"example.org\", 1234)\nserver = JavaServer.lookup(\"example.org:1234\")\n\n# 'status' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.\n# Don't expect the player list to always be complete, because many servers run\n# plugins that hide this information or limit the number of players returned or even\n# alter this list to contain fake players for purposes of having a custom message here.\nstatus = server.status()\nprint(f\"The server has {status.players.online} player(s) online and replied in {status.latency} ms\")\n\n# 'ping' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.\n# It is included in a 'status' call, but is also exposed separate if you do not require the additional info.\nlatency = server.ping()\nprint(f\"The server replied in {latency} ms\")\n\n# 'query' has to be enabled in a server's server.properties file!\n# It may give more information than a ping, such as a full player list or mod information.\nquery = server.query()\nprint(f\"The server has the following players online: {', '.join(query.players.names)}\")\n```\n\n#### Bedrock Edition\n\n```python\nfrom mcstatus import BedrockServer\n\n# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function\n# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use BedrockServer(\"example.org\", 19132)\nserver = BedrockServer.lookup(\"example.org:19132\")\n\n# 'status' is the only feature that is supported by Bedrock at this time.\n# In this case status includes players_online, latency, motd, map, gamemode, and players_max. (ex: status.gamemode)\nstatus = server.status()\nprint(f\"The server has {status.players_online} players online and replied in {status.latency} ms\")\n```\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nThis only works with Java servers; Bedrock is not yet supported. Use `mcstatus -h` to see helpful information on how to use this script.\n\n## License\n\nMcstatus is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. See LICENSE for full text.\n",
