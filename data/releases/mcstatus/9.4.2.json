(ex: status.gamemode)\nstatus = server.status()\nprint(f\"The server has {status.players_online} players online and replied in {status.latency} ms\")\n```\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nAt present time, this only works with Java servers, Bedrock is not yet supported.\n```\n$ mcstatus\nUsage: mcstatus [OPTIONS] ADDRESS COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  mcstatus provides an easy way to query Minecraft servers for any\n  information they can expose. It provides three modes of access: query,\n  status, and ping.\n\n  Examples:\n\n  $ mcstatus example.org ping\n  21.120ms\n\n  $ mcstatus example.org:1234 ping\n  159.903ms\n\n  $ mcstatus example.org status\n  version: v1.8.8 (protocol 47)\n  description: \"A Minecraft Server\"\n  players: 1/20 ['Dinnerbone (61699b2e-d327-4a01-9f1e-0ea8c3f06bc6)']\n\n  $ mcstatus example.org query\n  host: 93.148.216.34:25565\n  software: v1.8.8 vanilla\n  plugins: []\n  motd: \"A Minecraft Server\"\n  players: 1/20 ['Dinnerbone (61699b2e-d327-4a01-9f1e-0ea8c3f06bc6)']\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  json    combination of several other commands with json formatting\n  ping    prints server latency\n  query   detailed server information\n  status  basic server information\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nMcstatus is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/), and can be installed trivially with:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install mcstatus\n```\n\nAlternatively, just clone this repo!\n\n## License\n\nMcstatus is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\n",
