    "description": "This is a Django application that adds management commands for\nmanaging your caches.\n\nIt has been tested with these combinations:\n\n- Python 3.5, 3.7 and Django 1.11, 2.1 and 2.2.\n\nThis code is currently used in production.\n\nIt provides these commands:\n\n* ``listcaches``: lists the caches configured in your Django project.\n\n* ``pingcache``: verifies that one or more caches are accessible\n  (\"pings\" them).\n\n* ``clearcache``: clears one or more caches.\n\n### Changelog\n\n* 4.0.1:\n\n  + Don't use or require ``six`` anymore. It was an oversight that it stayed in\n    after we dropped support for Python 2.7.\n\n* 4.0.0:\n\n  + Formally support Django 2.2. (This package already worked fine on it.)\n\n  + Drop support for Django 2.0. It reached EOL.\n\n  + Drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.4.\n\n* 3.0.0:\n\n  + Drop support for Django versions prior to 1.11. This is a breaking change\n    and so require a new major number.\n\n  + Formally support 1.11, 2.0 and 2.1. (This package already worked fine on\n    them.)\n\n* 2.0.0:\n\n  + Formally follow the semver spec for version numbers. Previous\n    version numbers were bumped haphazardly.\n\n  + Drop support for Django 1.7.\n\n  + Fix problems with running on Django 1.10. Version 1.0.1 was\n    supposed to support Django 1.10 but I discovered, much to my\n    displeasure, that ``tox`` silently disregarded the disconnect\n    between its test specification (\"please install Django 1.10.x\")\n    and a mistake in ``setup.py`` (\"I want a Django version lower than\n    1.10\"). The net result was that the tests that were supposed to be\n    done with 1.10 were done with a lower version... *sigh*.\n\n  + ``listcaches`` now supports the case where the configuration\n    settings for caches contain unserializable values.\n\n* 1.0.1:\n\n  + Added formal support for Django 1.9, 1.10. The previous version\n    was already running fine on them, but the dependencies and the\n    test setup have been tweaked for these versions of Django.\n\n  + Drop support for Django 1.6.\n",
