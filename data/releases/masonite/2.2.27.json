Please excuse anything that looks a little funky while this happens.**\n\n\n## About Masonite\n\nThe modern and developer centric Python web framework that strives for an actual batteries included developer tool with a lot of out of the box functionality with an extremely extendable architecture. Masonite is perfect for beginner developers getting into their first web applications as well as experienced devs that need to utilize the full potential of Masonite to get their applications done.\n\nMasonite works hard to be fast and easy from install to deployment so developers can go from concept to creation in as quick and efficiently as possible. Use it for your next SaaS! Try it once and you’ll fall in love.\n\n* Having a simple and expressive routing engine\n* Extremely powerful command line helpers called `craft` commands\n* A simple migration system, removing the \"magic\" and finger crossing of migrations\n* A great Active Record style ORM called Orator\n* A great filesystem architecture for navigating and expanding your project\n* An extremely powerful Service Container (IOC Container)\n* Service Providers which makes Masonite extremely extendable\n\n## Learning Masonite\n\nMasonite strives to have extremely comprehensive documentation. All documentation can be [Found Here](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/) and would be wise to go through the tutorials there. If you find any discrepencies or anything that doesn't make sense, be sure to comment directly on the documentation to start a discussion!\n\nIf you are a visual learner you can find tutorials here: [MasoniteCasts](https://casts.masonite.dev)\n\nAlso be sure to join the [Slack channel](http://slack.masoniteproject.com/)!\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributing to Masonite is simple:\n* Hop on [Slack Channel](http://slack.masoniteproject.com/)! to ask any questions you need.\n* Read the [How To Contribute](https://masoniteframework.gitbook.io/docs/prologue/how-to-contribute) documentation to see ways to contribute to the project.\n* Read the [Contributing Guide](https://masoniteframework.gitbook.io/docs/prologue/contributing-guide) to learn how to contribute to the core source code development of the project.\n* Read the [Installation](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/#installation) documentation on how to get started creating a Masonite project.\n* Check the [open issues and milestones](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/core/issues).\n* If you have any questions just [open up an issue](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/core/issues/new/choose) to discuss with the core maintainers.\n* [Follow Masonite Framework on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masoniteproject) to get updates about tips and tricks, announcement and releases.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.4 +\n- OpenSSL (latest version)\n- Pip\n\n## Linux\n\nIf you are running on a Linux flavor, you’ll need a few extra packages before you start. You can download these packages by running:\n\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libssl-dev\n```\n\nInstead of `python-dev` you may need to specify your Python version\n\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev libssl-dev\n```\n\n## Windows\n\nWith windows you will need to have the latest OpenSSL version. Install [OpenSSL 32-bit or 64-bit](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).\n\n## Mac\n\nIf you do not have the latest version of OpenSSL you will encounter some installation issues with creating new applications since we need to download a zip of the application via GitHub.\n\nWith Mac you can install OpenSSL through `brew`.\n\n```\nbrew install openssl\n```\n\nPython 3.6 does not come preinstalled with certificates so you may need to install certificates with this command:\n\n```\n/Applications/Python\\ 3.6/Install\\ Certificates.command\n```\n\nYou should now be good to install new Masonite application of Mac :)\n\n### Python 3.7\n\nIf you are using [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), add it to your PATH Environment variable.\n\nOpen Windows PowerShell and run: `pip install masonite-cli`\n\nAdd `C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\.AppData\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\Scripts\\` to PATH Environment variable.\n\nNote: PATH variables depend on your installation folder\n\n## Installation:\n\n```\n    $ pip3 install masonite-cli :: (may need sudo if using UNIX) ::\n    $ craft new project\n    $ cd project\n    $ craft install\n    $ craft serve\n```\n\nGo to `http://localhost:8000/`\n****\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\nNot all computers are made the same so you may have some trouble installing Masonite depending on your machine. If you have any issues be sure to read the [Known Installation Issues](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/prologue/known-installation-issues) Documentation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\n****\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [Contributing Documentation](https://masoniteframework.gitbook.io/docs/prologue/contributing-guide) here. Development will be on the current releasing branch of the [Core Repository](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/core) (typically the `develop` branch) so check open issues, the current Milestone and the releases in that repository. Ask any questions you like in the issues so we can have an open discussion about the framework, design decisions and future of the project.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThank you for those who have contributed to Masonite!\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n| | | | | | |\n| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |\n| [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6290791?s=460&v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Vaibhav Mule</b></sub>](https://github.com/vaibhavmule) | [<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6276555?v=3\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Martín Peveri</b></sub>](https://github.com/mapeveri) | [<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25895176?v=3\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Adorifski</b></sub>](https://github.com/afdolriski) | [<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1970073?v=3\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Abram C.

Below is how you can get a simple Hello World application up and running.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe best way to install Masonite is by starting in a virtual environment first. This will avoid any issues with filesystem permissions.\n\n```\npython3 -m venv venv\n```\n\nThen activate the virtual environment:\n\n```\nWINDOWS: $ ./venv/Scripts/activate\nMAC: $ source venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n\nYou can easily create new applications with `craft`. To create a new application run:\n\n```\n$ pip install masonite-cli\n$ craft new project .\n```\n\nThe `.` will tell craft to create the project in the current directory instead of a new directory.\n\n```\n$ craft install\n```\n\nThis will install all of Masonites dependencies as well as create a new `.env` file consisting of all of your environment variables.\n\n****\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\nNOTE: Python craft commands are essentially wrappers around common mundane tasks. Read the docs about the craft command tool to learn more\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\n****\n\n\nNow we can run the `craft` command:\n\n    $ craft serve\n\nThis will run the server at `localhost:8000` and be in an auto-reloading state. When you change files, your server will restart. Navigating to that URL should show the Masonite welcome message. \n\nIf that port is blocked you can specify a port by running:\n\n    $ craft serve --port 8080\n\nOr specify a host by running:\n\n    $ craft serve --host 192.168.1.283\n\n## Hello World\n\nAll web routes are in `routes/web.py`. In this file is already the route to the welcome controller. To start your hello world example just add something like:\n\n```python\nGet('/hello/world', 'HelloWorldController@show'),\n```\n\nour routes constant file should now look something like:\n\n```python\nROUTES = [\n    Get('/', 'WelcomeController@show'),\n    Get('/hello/world', 'HelloWorldController@show'),\n]\n```\n\n****\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\nNOTE: Notice this new interesting string syntax in our route. This will grant our route access to a controller (which we will create below)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\n\n****\n\nSince we used a string controller we don't have to import our controller into this file. All imports are done through Masonite on the backend.\n\nYou'll notice that we have a reference to the HelloWorldController class which we do not have yet. This framework uses controllers in order to separate the application logic. Controllers can be looked at as the views.py in a Django application. The architectural standard here is 1 controller per file.\n\nIn order to make the `HelloWorldController` we can use a `craft` command:\n\n    $ craft controller HelloWorld\n\nThis will scaffold the controller for you and put it in `app/http/controllers/HelloWorldController.py`. This new file will have all the imports for us.\n\nInside the `HelloWorldController` we can make our `show` method like this:\n\n```python\ndef show(self, view: View):\n    \"\"\" Show Hello World Template \"\"\"\n    return view.render('helloworld')\n```\n\nAs you see above, we are returning a `helloworld` template but we do not have that yet. All templates are in `resources/templates`. We can simply make a file called `helloworld.html` or run the `craft` command:\n\n    $ craft view helloworld\n\nWhich will create the `resources/templates/helloworld.html` template for us.\n\nLastly all templates run through the Jinja2 rendering engine so we can use any Jinja2 code inside our template like:\n\ninside the `resources/views/helloworld.html`\n\n```\n{{ 'Hello World' }}\n```\n\nNow just run the server:\n\n    $ craft serve\n\nAnd navigate to `localhost:8000/hello/world` and you will see `Hello World` in your browser.\n\nHappy Crafting!",
