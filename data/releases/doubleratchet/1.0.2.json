This library does currently _not_ offer sophisticated decision mechanisms for the deletion of skipped message keys. Skipped message keys are only deleted when the maximum amount is reached and old keys are deleted from the storage in FIFO order. There is no time-based or event-based deletion.\n\n## Testing, Type Checks and Linting ##\n\npython-doubleratchet uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as its testing framework, [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checks and both [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting. All tests/checks can be run locally with the following commands:\n\n```sh\n$ pip install --upgrade pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov mypy pylint flake8\n$ mypy --strict doubleratchet/ setup.py examples/ tests/\n$ pylint doubleratchet/ setup.py examples/ tests/\n$ flake8 doubleratchet/ setup.py examples/ tests/\n$ pytest --cov=doubleratchet --cov-report term-missing:skip-covered\n```\n\n## Documentation ##\n\nView the documentation on [readthedocs.io](https://python-doubleratchet.readthedocs.io/) or build it locally, which requires the Python packages listed in `docs/requirements.txt`. With all dependencies installed, run `make html` in the `docs/` directory. You can find the generated documentation in `docs/_build/html/`.",
