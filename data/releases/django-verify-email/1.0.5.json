Like any other app, this can be installed easyly by adding \"verify_email\" in your installed apps like:\n\n<b>Note : </b>This documentation assumes that you already have a mail server configured for your project to send mails. \n\nif Not, then your first step should be Step 0:\n\n### Step 0 :-\n\n--- Bypass this step if you already have these things setup for your project. ---\n\nIn your settings.py :\n```\nEMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'\nEMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'\nEMAIL_PORT = 587\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = True\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_ID') \nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_PW')\n\nDEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply<no_reply@domain.com>'\n```\n\n## Main steps... <hr>\n\n### Step 1 :-\nAdd \"verify_email\" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:\n```\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        \"verify_email.apps.VerifyEmailConfig\",\n    ]\n```\n<p id=\"step2\">\n<h3>Step 2 :-</h3>\n\nInclude the \"verify_email\" URLconf in your project urls.py like this:\n\n\n```\n\nurlpatterns = [\n\t...\n\tpath('verification/', include('verify_email.urls')),\t\n\n]\n```\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"step3\">\n<h3>Step 3 :-</h3>\n\nApply migrations...\n\n\n```\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n</p>\n\n\n\n### Step 4 :-\nFor sending email from a signup form, in your views.py import:\n\n```\n...\nfrom verify_email.email_handler import send_verification_email\n```\nNow in the function where you are validation the form:\n\n```\n...\n\ndef register_user(request):\n    ...\n\n    if form.is_valid():\n\n        inactive_user = send_verification_email(request, form)\n```\n\n<b>Attention : </b>\"send_verification_email()\" takes two arguments, requests and form in order to set user's active status. \n\nThe \"inactive_user\" is returned by \"send_verification_email()\" contains a saved user object just like form.save() would do.(with is_active status set as False) which you can further user to extract user information from cleaned_data dict, like :\n\n```\ninactive_user.cleaned_data['email']\n\n# Output : test-user123@gmail.com\n```\nThe user is already been saved as inactive and you don't have to .save() it explicitly.\n\n<b>If anything goes wrong in sending the verification link email, the user will not be saved, so that user can try again.</b>\n\n\n\n### At this point, you are good to go...\n Start the development server and signup with an email and you should be getting an email on the entered email with the default template for account activation. (You can provide your own html template. see <a href='#advance'>Advance Section</a>)\n\n <b>Note : </b>The app comes with default email templates which can be overriden. See <a href='#customemailtemplate'> Custom Email Templates</a>\n\n# Verifying User's email : \n\n<h3 style='text-align:center'>Nothing...</h3><br>\n\nThat's right ! , you don't have to impliment any other code for validating user with their respective unique tokens and emails. \n\n<b>The app takes care of everything in background.</b>\n\n* When user click on the verification link, it comes to :\n    ```\n    path('verification/', include('verify_email')),\n    ```\n    which you defined in your project's urls.py in <a href='#step2'>step 2</a> above.\n* This pattern is further extended in this app's urls.py where it accepts encoded email and encoded hashed token from the verification link.\n* It then checks for user by that email.\n* If user exist, it then checks for token if it is valid for that user or not.\n* If the token is valid, it activates the user's account by setting is_active attribute to True and last_login to timezone.now().\n* If the token is alredy been redeemed or modified, you'll be redirected to a verification failed page.\n\n#### This whole process from generating HMAC hashed token for each user to verifying it for a unique user, is abstracted within the app ðŸ˜ƒ.\n\n\n\n<p id=\"advance\">\n\n<h1>Advance</h1>\n\n<p id=\"link-expiring\">\n<h2>Expiration of link and Resending emails :</h2>\n\nThe link by default do not expires until its been used atleast once, But you can **change** this behaviour by specifying the time as\n\"EXPIRE_AFTER\" in settings.py. The variable can be set as :\n* By default the time is considered in seconds, so if you set \"EXPIRE_AFTER\" as integer, that will be considered in seconds.\n* You can specify time unit for large times, max unit is days.\n* **Its very simple** just suffix the \"EXPIRE_AFTER\" variable's value with a time unit from [\"s\", \"m\", \"h\", \"d\"]. (Keep in mind, the \"m\" here is minutes, not month)\n\n**Example**\n\n* If i have to make a link expire after **one day**, then i\"d do:\n    * EXPIRE_AFTER = \"1d\"\n\n* If i have to make a link expire after **one hour**, then i\"d do:\n    * EXPIRE_AFTER = \"1h\"\n\n* If i have to make a link expire after **one minute**, then i\"d do:\n    * EXPIRE_AFTER = \"1m\"\n\nand so on... By default, if you do not specify a unit, it'll be considered as seconds.\n\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"resending-email\">\n<h2>Re-Sending Email</h2>\n\n\nA user can request new verification link **For a specific no. of times** in case of the previous one has expired. By default a user can request\nnew link **two times** which, obviously can be modified by you.\n\nSet a \"MAX_RETRIES\" variable in settings.py specifying the no. of times a user is allowed to request new link.\n\nAfter that no. is exceeded, the user will be automatically redired on an error page showing that you have maxed out.\n\n\n**NOTE :** This info is stored in database so you have to apply migrations (<a href='#step3'>step 3</a>) to use this feature. \n</p>\n\n<p id=\"customemailtemplate\">\n\n<h2>Custom Email Templates : </h2>\n\n\n\nThe app is packed with default html templates to handle the web pages but if you want to provide your own template you can do it by setting an attribute in settings.py :\n\n```\nHTML_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = \"path/to/html_template.html\"\n\nVERIFICATION_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE = \"path/to/success.html\"\n\nVERIFICATION_FAILED_TEMPLATE = \"path/to/failed.html\"\n```\n```\nSUBJECT = 'subject of email'\n\n# default subject is : Email Verification Mail\n```\n</p>\n\n## Inside Templates : <hr>\n\n### Custom HTML Message Template :\n\n<b>IMPORTANT : </b> if you are using custom html message template for email that has to be sent to user, <u>provide a <b>{{link}}</b> as a template tag to contain verification link.</u> \n\n<b>You Must Pass This In Your Template</b> . Otherwise the sent mail will not contain the verification link.\n\n\nFor Ex :\n\n```my_custom_email_message.html : ```\n\n```\n<div class=\"format-font\" >\n    <a href=\"{{link}}\" class=\"my-button\" >Verify</a>  # ----> The \"link\" variable is passed by the app's backend containing verification link.\n</div>\n```\n\n----> \"link\" is a variable, that contains verification link, is passed in html message template during sending the email to user.\n\n\n### Custom HTML Verification Success and Failed pages : \n<hr>\n\n<b>Success :</b> \n\nTwo variables are passed in context dict of \"VERIFICATION_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE\" :\n\n* ```{{mgs}}``` : Which contains the message to be displayed on successful verification.\n* ```{{link}}``` : Which contains redirect link to login page.\n\n<b>In template :</b>\n\n```\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center; color: white;\">\n    {{msg}}     # __--> message variable\n</h1>\n\n<a href=\"{{link}}\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">     # __--> Link of login page\n    Login\n</a>\n\n```\n\n<b>Failed :</b>\n\nOnly \"{{msg}}\" is passed for failed msg in template.\n\n\n<b>In template :</b>\n\n```\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center; color: white;\">\n    {{msg}}\n</h1>\n```\n\n\n\n## Successful Verification :\nAfter verification is successful, you might wanna redirect the user to login page. You can do this in two ways :\n\n* 1 <b>Redirect from success webpage.</b>\n\tThe user will be prompted to show success page with a button on it to navigate to Login page.\n    ```\n    LOGIN_URL = 'name of your login pattern'\n\n    Note: This variable is also used by django.\n    ```\n* 2 <b>Redirect directly to login page without stopping at success message page.</b>\n\tThe user will be directly sent to login page bypassing success page.\n    ```\n    VERIFICATION_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE = None\n    ```\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
