    "description": "# dnd-character\nA Python library to make 5e Dungeons & Dragons characters for use in another app. Characters are serializable into Python dicts so they can be saved and loaded however you wish.\n\nSRD rules are fetched from the [5e SRD API](https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api) the first time they're requested, then the JSON is cached locally for faster retrieval in the future. I've included the `json_cache` containing the SRD inside the repo in case this API changes, but when the API does change I will update this library. So please pin your version if you want to avoid any breaking changes.\n\n\n## Installation and Use\n1. Install from PyPI using `pip install dnd-character`\n1. See `example.py` for example code on how to use the library.\n\n\n## Licenses\nThe software is EPL-2.0 and the text for this license is in `LICENSE` as is standard for software. Originally forked from [PyDnD](https://github.com/Coffee-fueled-deadlines/PyDnD). The contents of `dnd_character/json_cache` are retrieved from [5e-srd-api](https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api/issues/114), and are covered by the Open Game License. See `dnd_character/json_cache/OGLv1.0a.txt` for details.\n\n\n## Character Object\nNormal initialization arguments for a Character object:\n```\nname         (str)\nage          (str)\ngender       (str)\nalignment    (str): character's two letter alignment\ndescription  (str): physical description of player character\nbiography    (str): backstory of player character\t\nlevel        (int): starting level\nwealth       (int): starting wealth\t\nstrength     (int)\ndexterity    (int)\nconstitution (int)\nwisdom       (int)\nintelligence (int)\ncharisma     (int)\nhp           (int):\nclasss      (dict): JSON returned from the 5e API -- dnd_character.SRD.SRD_classes[\"bard\"]\n```\nIn addition, the Character object can receive attributes that are normally set automatically, such as the UUID. This is for re-loading the objects from serialized data (via `Character(**characterData)`) and probably aren't arguments you would write manually into your code.\n\n\n## Leveling and Experience\nThe library should help leveling up characters automatically if simply manage the Character's `experience` attribute. It's better to avoid modifying the level directly.\n\n### Example\n```\n>>> thor = Character(name=\"Thor\")\n>>> thor.experience += 1000\n>>> thor.level\n3\n>>> thor.experience.to_next_level\n1700\n>>> thor.experience += thor.experience.to_next_level\n>>> thor.level\n4\n```\n\n\n",
