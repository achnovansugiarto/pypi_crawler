    "description": "This library implements something which is often called live coding or code\r\nreloading. It allows an application to have Python code which might be part\r\nof it updated as the files the code is in are changed - while the application is\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n * No need to restart the application in order to incorporate changes made to\r\nPython scripts.\r\n * No need to execute Python scripts manually each time you want to use the code\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\nChanges from version 2.0:\r\n\r\n* Scripts are now read in universal line ending mode before being executed. \r\nThis prevents SyntaxErrors from happening on platforms other than Windows when\r\nscripts being read contain \\r\\n line endings.\r\n* Adjusted the unit tests to handle the fact that file modification timestamps\r\nare limited to a per-second resolution on Linux-like platforms.  The tests were\r\npassing on Windows because it has a higher resolution for these timestamps.",
