Specifially, all window management on macOSes are handled\nwith Yabai.  **macpywm** only provides **xpywm**-compatible functions\nsuch as the programmed window layout, the tiled window layout, and\nseveral **xpywm**-compatible functions.\n\n**macpywm** supports two types of window placement algorithms:\nprogrammed mode and tiled mode.\n\nIn the programmed mode, you can specify rules for inferring\nappropriate window geometries.  By default, Emacs is placed at the\ntop-left corner of the screen with 50% window width and 100% window\nheight.  Web browsers (e.g., Safari) and office applications are\nplaced next to the Emacs with 50% window width and 100% window height.\nThe terminal window is placed at the bottom-right corner with 50%\nwindow width and 70% window height.  If there exist more than two\nterminal windows, the size of each terminal window is shrunk to 1/4 of\nthe screen, and placed in a non-overlapping way.\n\nIn the titled mode, all windows are placed in a titled fashion so that\nany window will have the same window width and height, and that any\nwindow will not overlap with others, as like tile-based window\nmanagers.  Moreover, **macpywm** tries to allocate larger area for\nEmacs; i.e., if there are three windows, say, Emacs and two terminals,\nEmacs will occupy the half of the screen, and each terminal will have\nthe quarter of the screen.\n\n# OPTIONS\n\nNone\n\n# SCREENSHOTS\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/h-ohsaki/macpywm/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot-1.png)\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/h-ohsaki/macpywm/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot-2.png)\n\n# INSTALLATION\n\n1. Save two configuration files (~.yabairc~ and ~.skhdrc~) in your\n   home directory.\n\n  - ~.yabairc~\n    https://github.com/h-ohsaki/macpywm/blob/master/.yabairc\n  - ~.skhdrc~\n    https://github.com/h-ohsaki/macpywm/blob/master/.skhdrc\n\n2. Install yabai (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and skhd\n   (https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd).\n\n```sh\n$ brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai\n$ brew services start yabai\n$ brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd\n$ brew services start skhd\n```\n\nSee yabai wiki (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki) for the\ninstallation details.\n\nNote that yabai and skhd configuration files (~.yabairc~ and\n~.skhdrc~) must not be overwritten.\n\n3. Install macpywm from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/macpywm/)\n\n```sh\n$ pip3 install macpywm\n```\n\n# CUSTOMIZATION\n\nSince Python is one of interpreters, you can easily customize the\nbehavior of **macpywm** by directly modifying its variables,\nfunctions, and methods.  For instance, if you want to customize the\nrules for the programmed window placement, simply edit the definition\nof the variable LAYOUT_RULES.\n\n# BINDINGS\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + i\n\n  Focus the next window.  Available windows are circulated in the order of\n  top-left, bottom-left, top-right, and bottom-right.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + '\n\n  Toggle the maximization of the current active window.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + ;\n\n  Toggle the vertical maximization of the current active window.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + ,\n\n  Layout all available windows in the programmed mode.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + .\n\n  Layout all available windows in the tiled mode.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + z\n\n  Destroy the current active window.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + y\n\n  Hide the current active window.\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + 1\n\n  Run a command \"open -n -a /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\".\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + 2\n\n  Run a command \"open -a emacs --args -rv\"\n\n- Ctrl + Mod1 + 3\n\n  Run a command \"open -a /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\"\n\n# AVAILABILITY\n\nThe latest version of **macpywm** is available at PyPI\n(https://pypi.org/project/macpywm/) .\n\n# AUTHOR\n\nHiroyuki Ohsaki <ohsaki[atmark]lsnl.jp>\n\n\n",
