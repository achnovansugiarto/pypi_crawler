    "description": "Overview\n========\n\nThis package provides a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_ app whose static folder contains\nthe sources of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap>`_, nothing more and nothing\nless. The un-minified `LESS <http://lesscss.org>`_ and javascript sources are included to be\nintegrated into your Django site as you see fit. If you simply want to use the minified CSS and JS\nfiles provided by the Bootstrap project, you probably don't need this anyway.\n\nFurther goals of this project include:\n\n- To include Bootstrap as a git submodule, so as to include specific release tags and avoid the\n  mess of managing a copy of Bootstrap.\n- To provide versions that mirror Bootstrap releases going forward.\n- To provide a simple example project that demonstrates usage.\n\nAnd that's it! Twitter Bootstrap pre-packaged for Django.\n\nI found that other similar projects:\n\n- Did not keep up with recent versions of Bootstrap.\n- Simply made a copy of the Bootstrap sources, messy and unecessary.\n- Tied the packaging to their own clever template tags or other Django components. You should have\n  your choice of these things apart from this packaging.\n\nSetup\n=====\n\n**NOTE** The paths of the included bootstrap assets have now been namespaced within the app's\n``static`` folder. The ``less`` and ``js`` folders now reside within a ``twitter_bootstrap``\nfolder.\n\nA sample working project can be found\n`here <https://github.com/estebistec/django-twitter-bootstrap/tree/master/demo_site>`_.\n\nFirst, install the app::\n\n    pip install django-twitter-bootstrap==3.0.2\n\nThen include it in your Django project::\n\n    # settings.py:\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'twitter_bootstrap',\n        ...\n    )\n\nThis also assumes you haven't removed ``django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder``\nfrom the ``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` config setting.\n\nProvided staticfiles\n====================\n\nOf course what's provided is just Bootstrap, but more specifically...\n\nLESS\n----\n\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less``\n\nAlso included are lots of other LESS files included by the above that aren't worth listing out.\nThe above file is the common entry point for usage of Bootstrap styles.\n\nJavaScript\n----------\n\nUnlike the LESS sources, the javascript modules each represent a feature set\nthat you may or may not want to include in your site. These files are\ntypically hand-picked based on the needs of your site. Please check the\nBootstrap documentation for info on which of these modules depends on others.\n\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/transition.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/modal.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/dropdown.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/scrollspy.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/tab.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/tooltip.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/popover.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/alert.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/button.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/collapse.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/carousel.js``\n- ``twitter_bootstrap/js/affix.js``\n\nPlain Usage\n===========\n\nIf you're not using an asset manager, you can just include them as usual in your site templates::\n\n    {% load staticfiles %}\n    ...\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{% static 'twitter_bootstrap/js/transition.js' %}\"></script>\n    ...\n\nUsage with an asset pipeline\n============================\n\nOf course I recommend you not go plain, and instead use an asset manager that helps with the\nfiltering, concatenating, minification, and other processing of your static assets. One such\nmanager is `django-pipeline <https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline>`_.\n\n- Follow the setup instructions for django-pipeline\n- Define asset groups which provide Twitter Bootstrap\n- Use asset groups in your templates.\n\nHere are example pipeline settings::\n\n    # settings.py\n\n    PIPELINE_CSS = {\n        ...\n        'bootstrap': {\n            'source_filenames': (\n                'twitter_bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less',\n            ),\n            'output_filename': 'css/b.css',\n            'extra_context': {\n                'media': 'screen,projection',\n            },\n        },\n        ...\n    }\n\n    PIPELINE_JS = {\n        ...\n        'bootstrap': {\n            'source_filenames': (\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/transition.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/modal.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/dropdown.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/scrollspy.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/tab.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/tooltip.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/popover.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/alert.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/button.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/collapse.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/carousel.js',\n              'twitter_bootstrap/js/affix.js',\n            ),\n            'output_filename': 'js/b.js',\n        },\n        ...\n    }\n\nOf course you need to set up a\n`LESS compiler <http://django-pipeline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/compilers.html#less-compiler>`_\nfor pipeline to use when processing the styles.\n\nA sample Django template using the assets::\n\n    ...\n    {% load compressed %}\n    ...\n    <head>\n      ...\n      {% compressed_css 'bootstrap' %}\n      ...\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      ...\n      {% compressed_js 'bootstrap' %}\n      ...\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\nThat's it. Enjoy!\n\nVersion ranges matching bootstrap versions\n==========================================\n\nAs stated above in the goals, versions of this package should match versions of Bootstrap, where\navailable. This presents something of a problem if and when we need to make updates to the\n*packaging* here. We can't just upgrade any of the three common components of semantic versioning,\nbecause those map to versions of Bootstrap. So, we'll use revisions when needed.\n\nE.g., suppose we have django-twitter-bootstrap 2.2.2 which packages Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2. If we\nneed to enhance or fix the packaging, we release it as revised version 2.2.2-1.\n\nTherefore, if you're getting a packaging for the first time you could specify it as a very tight\nrange of that target version or no less than the next patch level version. E.g., target 2.2.2 with\n``>=2.2.2,<2.2.3``, or ``>=2,<2.0.1``. Each of these captures all revisions to packagings\ntargetting a specific version of Bootstrap.\n\nFinally, it should be re-iterated that the need for this should be the exception and versions\nshould generally mirror Bootstrap more directly going forward.\n",
