    "description": "## Overview\n\nThis package provides a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) app whose\nstatic folder contains the sources of\n[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), nothing more and\nnothing less. The un-minified [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and javascript sources\nare included to be integrated into your Django site as you see fit. If you\nsimply want to use the minified CSS and JS files provided by the Bootstrap\nproject, you probably don't need this anyway.\n\nFurther goals of this project include:\n\n * To include Bootstrap as a git submodule, so as to include specific release\n   tags and avoid the mess of managing a copy of Bootstrap.\n * To provide versions that mirror Bootstrap releases going forward.\n * To provide a simple example project that demonstrates usage.\n\nAnd that's it! Twitter Bootstrap pre-packaged for Django.\n\nI found that other similar projects:\n\n * Did not keep up with recent versions of Bootstrap.\n * Simply made a copy of the Bootstrap sources, messy and unecessary.\n * Tied the packaging to their own clever template tags or other Django\n   components. You should have your choice of these things apart from this\n   packaging.\n\n## Setup\n\nA sample working project can be found\n[here](https://github.com/estebistec/django-twitter-bootstrap/tree/master/demo_site).\n\nFirst, install the app:\n\n```bash\npip install django-twitter-bootstrap==3.0.0\n```\n\nThen include it in your Django project.\n\n```python\n# settings.py:\n\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'twitter_bootstrap',\n    ...\n)\n```\n\nThis also assumes you haven't removed\n`django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder` from the\n`STATICFILES_FINDERS` config setting.\n\n## Provided staticfiles\n\nOf course what's provided is just Bootstrap, but more specifically...\n\n### LESS\n\n * `less/bootstrap.less`\n\nAlso included are lots of other LESS files included by the above that aren't\nworth listing out. The above two files are the common entry points for usage of\nBootstrap styles.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nUnlike the LESS sources, the javascript modules each represent a feature set\nthat you may or may not want to include in your site. These files are\ntypically hand-picked based on the needs of your site. Please check the\nBootstrap documentation for info on which of these modules depends on others.\n\n * `js/transition.js`\n * `js/modal.js`\n * `js/dropdown.js`\n * `js/scrollspy.js`\n * `js/tab.js`\n * `js/tooltip.js`\n * `js/popover.js`\n * `js/alert.js`\n * `js/button.js`\n * `js/collapse.js`\n * `js/carousel.js`\n * `js/affix.js`\n\n## Plain Usage\n\nIf you're not using an asset manager, you can just include them as usual in\nyour site templates.\n\n```html\n{% load staticfiles %}\n...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{% static 'js/transition.js' %}\"></script>\n...\n```\n\n## Usage with an asset pipeline\n\nOf course I recommend you not go plain, and instead use an asset manager that\nhelps with the filtering, concatenating, minification, and other processing of\nyour static assets. One such manager is\n[django-pipeline](https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline).\n\n * Follow the setup instructions for django-pipeline\n * Define asset groups which provide Twitter Bootstrap\n * Use asset groups in your templates.\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\nPIPELINE_CSS = {\n    ...\n    'bootstrap': {\n        'source_filenames': (\n            'less/bootstrap.less',\n        ),\n        'output_filename': 'css/b.css',\n        'extra_context': {\n            'media': 'screen,projection',\n        },\n    },\n    ...\n}\n\nPIPELINE_JS = {\n    ...\n    'bootstrap': {\n        'source_filenames': (\n          'js/transition.js',\n          'js/modal.js',\n          'js/dropdown.js',\n          'js/scrollspy.js',\n          'js/tab.js',\n          'js/tooltip.js',\n          'js/popover.js',\n          'js/alert.js',\n          'js/button.js',\n          'js/collapse.js',\n          'js/carousel.js',\n          'js/affix.js',\n        ),\n        'output_filename': 'js/b.js',\n    },\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nOf course you need to\n[set up a LESS compiler](http://django-pipeline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/compilers.html#less-compiler)\nfor pipeline to use when processing the styles.\n\n```html\n...\n{% load compressed %}\n...\n<head>\n  ...\n  {% compressed_css 'bootstrap' %}\n  ...\n</head>\n<body>\n  ...\n  {% compressed_js 'bootstrap' %}\n  ...\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThat's it. Enjoy!\n\n## Version ranges matching bootstrap versions\n\nAs stated above in the goals, versions of this package should match versions of\nBootstrap, where available. This presents something of a problem if and when we\nneed to make updates to the *packaging* here. We can't just upgrade any of the\nthree common components of semantic versioning, because those map to versions\nof Bootstrap. So, we'll use revisions when needed.\n\nE.g., suppose we have django-twitter-bootstrap 2.2.2 which packages Twitter\nBootstrap 2.2.2. If we need to enhance or fix the packaging, we release it as\nrevised version 2.2.2-1.\n\nTherefore, if you're getting a packaging for the first time you could specify\nit as a very tight range of that target version or no less than the next patch\nlevel version. E.g., target 2.2.2 with `>=2.2.2,<2.2.3`, or `>=2,<2.0.1`.\nEach of these captures all revisions to packagings targetting a specific\nversion of Bootstrap.\n\nFinally, it should be re-iterated that the need for this should be the\nexception and versions should generally mirror Bootstrap more directly going\nforward.\n",
