    "description": "# meanwhile - Very Easy Multithreading\n\nThis module is useful when you want to apply the same function to many values,\nand you want to do it in many threads. It's useful when the function requires\nI/O operations, like file access or HTTP(S) queries.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip3 install meanwhile\n```\n\n## Simple Usage Example\n\nAssume you have a function named ```test_url```, that gets a URL, downloads\nits content, and tests whether it contains the word \"meanwhile\". Also,\nassume you have a file, named ```urls.txt```, where each line contains a URL\nyou would like to apply ```test_url``` to.\n\nYou can do the following:\n\n```python\n>>> from meanwhile import Job\n>>> job = Job(test_url, 10)    # 10 threads will be used.\n>>> urls = open(\"urls.txt\").read().splitlines()\n>>> job.add_many(urls)\n>>> job.wait()\n>>> results = job.get_results()\n```\n\nNote that the function you apply to each input must get one argument, and that\nthis argument must be hashable.\n\nNote that if your function prints output, you probably want to use \n```meanwhile.print()``` instead of the built-in ```print()``` function.\n\n## Advanced Features\n\nThe module supports many useful features. For example, you can:\n\n* Get progress info;\n* Change the number of threads used;\n* Pause and resume all threads;\n* Add new inputs, when the job is already in progress, or even finished;\n* Inspect exceptions raised by inputs;\n* Replace the target function;\n* Automatically or manually retry inputs that caused exceptions.\n\nFor full documentation, see ```help(meanwhile.Job)```.",
