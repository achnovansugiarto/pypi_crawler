    "description": "# Lolikit\n\n**Lolikit** is a command line toolkit for Lolinote project. Which is a lightweigth, extremely flexible and no secret personal note-taking ruleset. [Check here](https://bitbucket.org/civalin/lolinote/wiki) for more detail about lolinote project.\n\nIf you follow the Loli's roles, The `lolikit` provide some nice tools can work with Loli more comfortable.\n\nActurally, Loli is small and cute.\n\n\n\n# How to Install?\n\nYou must have a python >= 3.4 and pip. then...\n\nlinux:\n\n    pip3 install lolikit\n\nwindows:\n\n    py -m pip install lolikit\n\n\n\n# How to Use?\n\nThis is some examples:\n\n```sh\n# first, read the Loli's rules...\n\nloli help rules\n\n\n# initialize your project (if not exists)...\n\nmkdir notes\ncd notes\nloli init\n\n\n# create / view / edit / move / copy / sync / backup your notes in the project folder...\n# Hint: you can use any tools to do anything you want\n\ntouch math.md\nretext math.md\nvim video-games-review.md\n\n\n# try to use lolikit for daily work...\n\nloli show                       # show current project's info.\n\nloli find eric                  # fulltext search -> keyword: \"eric\"\nloli find \"192\\.168\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\"  # fulltext search -> a IPv4 match 192.168.*.*\n\nloli list                       # show a notes list sorted by modified time\n\nloli serve                      # startup a mini web server. let your project and data working like a web site\n\nloli config                     # check current configuration\nloli config -u                  # open / edit user level config file. (create if not exists)\nloli config -p                  # open / edit project level config file. (create if not exists)\n\nloli check                      # find any defect in your project, and (if you want) try to fix it.\n```\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n## utf8 with BOM?\n\nCurrently lolikit just simple ignore the BOM. But I highly recommended DO NOT contain BOM in your note files.\n\n\n\n## What's the newline format should I use?\n\nLolikit believe you should use **only one** kind of newline format (one of `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\r\\n`) in your project. But you can decided which one you want.\n\nYou can run `loli check` to check inconsistent of the newline characters.\n\n\n\n## LICENSE\n\nMIT LICENSE\n\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n## Version 1.4.2\n\n- Fixed: `loli serve` path == \"/source/\" not work.\n- Fixed: pip distribution not work with data_files (bash-completion).\n\n\n\n## Version 1.4.1\n\n- Fixed: remove the auth check if no username and password in settings.\n\n\n\n## Version 1.4.0\n\n- Fixed: a lot of bugs on windows platform.\n- Fixed: `loli show` cause zero division when current project folder is empty.\n- Fixed: selector recognize resourced note not consider the ignore patterns.\n- Tweaked: `loli dig` rename to `loli do` and change the API.
