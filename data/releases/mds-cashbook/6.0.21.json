    "description": "mds-cashbook\n============\nTryton module to add a cashbook.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\npip install mds-cashbook\n\nRequires\n========\n- Tryton 6.0\n\nHow to\n======\n\nThis module adds a cash book to Tryton. Each Tryton user can have\nany number of cash books. The cash books can be arranged hierarchically.\nA cash book contains simple postings, such as expense, revenue, transfer,\nsplit posting. Each booking has a category, an amount and possibly a description.\nThe cash books of the different Tryton users are separated from\neach other by permissions. There is an enhancement module for the connection\nto the chart of accounts and analytic.\n\nThis module adds new user groups:\n\nCashbook\n    The user can make entries in his cash books.\n\nCashbook - WF - Check\n    The user can mark his bookings as 'checked'\n\nCashbook - WF - Done\n    The user can reconcile his cash books\n\nCashbook - Administrator\n    the Cashbook-Administrator\n\nThere is a possibility to allow reading or editing for other users via\nthe Tryton user groups. This makes it possible to set up a administrator\nfor all cash books of the Tryton system.\n\n\nSet up your cash book\n---------------------\n\nAdd the Tryton user to the *Cashbook* group. In the tab *Owner and Authorizeds*,\nenter the user as the owner. Enter *Type*, *Currency*, *Initial Date*\nand *Line Numbering*. Cash books without a type cannot receive postings\nand are treated as a view. You can create several cash books per user\nand arrange them hierarchically.\n\n\nCreating categories\n-------------------\n\nEach booking needs a category. The categories are separated by revenue and expense.\nIn the menu Cash Book / Configuration / Category you create some categories.\n\n\nUsing the chart of accounts\n---------------------------\n\nIf you want to have the postings as a posting record in Tryton Accounting\ninstall the *cashbook_account* module. For analytic, install *cashbook_analytic*.\nIn each of the cash books, add one account to the\nchart of accounts, in tab *Account Configuration*.\n\nIn the categories you add a chart of accounts account in the\ntab 'Account and Tax'. If you want to make your transactions with taxes,\nyou can also add one or more taxes.\n\nEnter bookings\n--------------\n\nThere are two ways to enter bookings.\n\n1) The *Enter Booking* wizard. The wizard is optimized for use on\n   small screens. You can write down expenses on the go with your smartphone.\n   The type of bookings is limited to expense, revenue and transfers between cash books.\n   When using the wizard, you should check the booking later and possibly complete it.\n\n2) The record form of a cash book. This option offers all posting variants,\n   such as expense, revenue, transfer to, transfer from, expense split posting\n   and revenue split posting. When using chart of accounts and analytic,\n   you also specify the taxes and analytic accounts here.\n\n\nProcessing states\n-----------------\n\nPostings in cash books have several workflow states.\n\nEdit\n    The entry has been created but not yet verified\n\nChecked\n    The user has checked his entry and has indicated this by clicking on 'Check'\n    When using the chart of accounts modules, posting records are created here\n    in the Draft state.\n\nReconciled\n    A user (with enough permissions) has checked the entry against a\n    bank statement. This step is performed in the 'Reconciliations' tab of a cash book.\n\nDone\n    The entry is committed. This step is performed by completing a\n    reconciliation in the cash book. When using the chart of accounts modules,\n    the posting records created in step 'Check' are committed.\n\n\nReconciliation\n--------------\n\nThe bookings should be checked regularly against a bank statement. This is done\nin the 'Reconciliations' tab of a cash book.\n\n1) Click the plus button, don't change anything about the contents,\n   click *ok*, save the cash book. The system will change the dates of the\n   reconciliation so that all eligible bookings are taken into account.\n\n2) If you want to change the end date, do so now. Save.\n\n3) Open the reconciliation by double-clicking, click on *Check*.\n   This will insert all posting lines into the list. The posting lines\n   in the cash book are now protected against edit.\n\n4) Now check line by line against an account statement. To remember what you\n   have already seen, click the 'Reconciled' button.\n\n5) When you're done, click the *Done* button of the reconciliation. This\n   sets all posting lines and the reconciliation to *Done*.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThe configuration in the menu Cash Book / Configuration is a user-specific setting.\nThe user can choose which cash books appear in the *Enter Booking* dialog and\nwhich default settings should apply when opening a cash book.\n\n\nForeign currencies\n------------------\n\nThe cash books can be used with foreign currency. Base currency is the company currency.\nFor transfers between cash books with different currencies, the current conversion\nrate in Tryton is used. You can adjust the exchange rate actually used in the booking dialog.\nIf you have hierarchical cash books, the amounts of subordinate cash books with foreign\ncurrency are converted  into the display currency of the parent cash book.\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n*6.0.21 - 29.11.2022*\n\n- updt: remove 'reconcile' button from line-form\n- add: how to\n\n*6.0.20 - 16.11.2022*\n\n- add: new state 'reconciled' at line\n\n*6.0.19 - 19.10.2022*\n\n- fix: delete()\n\n*6.0.18 - 11.10.2022*\n\n- updt: optimized open/view of cashbook\n\n*6.0.17 - 10.10.2022*\n\n- add: colors for cashbook-lines\n- add: client stores tree-state of cashbook\n\n*6.0.16 - 07.10.2022*\n\n- add: open cashbook-lines from cashbook\n\n*6.0.15 - 04.10.2022*\n\n- updt: second-currency support optimized\n\n*6.0.14 - 30.09.2022*\n\n- fix: parameter\n\n*6.0.13 - 28.09.2022*\n\n- hierarchical ordering for cashbook\n- forms optimzed\n\n*6.0.12 - 18.09.2022*\n\n- add: selected cashbooks in 'enter-booking-dialog'\n\n*6.0.11 - 16.09.2022*\n\n- add: hierarchy for cashbooks\n\n*6.0.10 - 13.09.2022*\n\n- add: split-booking with transfer\n\n*6.0.9 - 08.09.2022*\n\n- updt: allow negative amounts\n\n*6.0.8 - 07.09.2022*\n\n- updt: enter-booking form optimized\n\n*6.0.7 - 07.09.2022*\n\n- add: enter-booking-wizard\n\n*6.0.6 - 06.09.2022*\n\n- updt: optimized form - line, line-context\n- updt: extended search in cashbook-lines\n\n*6.0.5 - 05.09.2022*\n\n- updt: view of book + line optimized\n\n*6.0.4 - 05.09.2022*\n\n- fix: write number at state-change 'check' -> 'done'\n- updt: speedup transaction view\n\n*6.0.3 - 31.08.2022*\n\n- updt: checks, sorting\n\n*6.0.2 - 25.08.2022*\n\n- add: split-booking\n\n*6.0.1 - 23.08.2022*\n\n- works\n\n*6.0.0 - 05.08.2022*\n\n- init\n\n\n",
