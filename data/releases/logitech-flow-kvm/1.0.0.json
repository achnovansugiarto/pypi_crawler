    "description": "Quickly switch between paired devices when using a mouse and keyboard that supports Logitech Flow.\n\nThis utility works by monitoring one of your attached devices to see what host it is currently connected to, and then, if that changes, instructing other connected devices to switch to the same host.\n\n# Installation\n\n```\npip install logitech-flow-kvm\n```\n\nYou can also install the in-development version with:\n\n```\n\npip install https://github.com/coddingtonbear/logitech-flow-kvm/archive/master.zip\n\n```\n\n# Basic Use\n\nOne of your computers will serve as the \"server\" for managing this, and all others will be \"clients\".\n\n## Server\n\nOn the computer you've decided to use as your server, get the ID of the device you'd like to serve as your \"leader\", and the IDs of other devices you'd like to use as \"followers\".  The leader device -- I recommend using your keyboard -- will be the one we watch.  The followers will just be told which host to connect to if your leader device's host changes.\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm list-devices\n\nFinding devices... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ ID             ┃ Product ┃ Name                       ┃ Serial   ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ /dev/hidraw4:1 │ B369    │ MX Keys Mini               │ 08F5F681 │\n│ /dev/hidraw5:1 │ 4082    │ MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse │ 0F591C09 │\n└────────────────┴─────────┴────────────────────────────┴──────────┘\n```\n\nIn this example, I'll be using my keyboard (`/dev/hidraw4:1`) as my \"leader\", and my mouse (`/dev/hidraw5:1`) as a follower.\n\nYou can run a command like this:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm flow-server 1 /dev/hidraw4:1 /dev/hidraw5:1\n```\n\nNote that the `1` in the above command immediately after `flow-server` indicates that the host number of your server is `1`.  This should match the host number you've paired your mouse and keyboard with your device as (i.e. when your mouse or keyboard is connected to this computer, the light for `1` is lit on the keyboard's device selector).\n\nWhen you run the above command, you'll receive some output indicating what hostnames the server was bound to; on my computer, this looks like this:\n\n```\n...\n * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)\n * Running on http://127.0.0.1:24801\n * Running on http://10.224.224.120:24801\n...\n```\n\nFrom the above lines, you'll want to select an IP address that can be reached from your clients.  In my case, I'll be using `10.224.224.120` for connections from the clients to the server.\n\n## Client\n\nOn the other computers you'd like to use this feature with, you can run the following command:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm flow-client 2 10.224.224.120\n```\n\nThe client will immediately connect, gather some configuration options from the server, and will instruct your \"follower\" devices to change their hosts as necessary.\n\nNote that the `2` above after `flow-client` indicates the host number your devices have paired with your computer under.  See \"Server\" above for details.\n\n# How to\n\n## Finding available devices\n\nYou can get a list of available devices using the `list-devices` subcommand:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm list-devices\n\nFinding devices... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ ID             ┃ Product ┃ Name                       ┃ Serial   ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ /dev/hidraw4:1 │ B369    │ MX Keys Mini               │ 08F5F681 │\n│ /dev/hidraw5:1 │ 4082    │ MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse │ 0F591C09 │\n└────────────────┴─────────┴────────────────────────────┴──────────┘\n```\n\n## Switching which host a device is connected to\n\nYou can change the relevant device to your desired host number using the `switch-to-host` command:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm switch-to-host /dev/hidraw4:1 2\n```\n\nThe above command will tell the device having the id `/dev/hidraw4:1` to connect to whichever device is paired as its #`2` device.\n\n## Running a command when a device connects or disconnects\n\nYou can see when a device connects or disconnects from the receiver using the following example:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm watch /dev/hidraw4:1\n```\n\nIf you'd like to run a command when a device connects or disconnects, use the `--on-disconnect-execute` or `--on-connect-execute` arguments.  See the \"How To\" section below for how you might use this.\n\n## Automatically switch your mouse to a different host when your keyboard disconnects\n\nNote: this isn't the recommended way of handling this sort of thing -- you probably want to follow the instructions above under \"Use\" above.\n\nIf you have two devices:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm list-devices\n\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ ID             ┃ Product ┃ Name                       ┃ Serial   ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ /dev/hidraw4:1 │ B369    │ MX Keys Mini               │ 08F5F681 │\n│ /dev/hidraw5:1 │ 4082    │ MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse │ 0F591C09 │\n└────────────────┴─────────┴────────────────────────────┴──────────┘\n```\n\nYou can respond run a command that will listen to when the \"MX Keys Mini\" device above disconnects, and when it does, ask the \"MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse\" to connect to a specific host:\n\n```\n> logitech-flow-kvm watch --on-disconnect-execute=\"logitech-flow-kvm switch-to-host /dev/hidraw5:1 2\" /dev/hidraw4:1\n```\n\n# Credits\n\nMuch of what this tool does is dependent upon the work put together by the folks working on [Solaar](https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar) -- really: all of the functionality provided here can also be done by Solaar alone, albeit just a little bit slower.\n\n\n",
