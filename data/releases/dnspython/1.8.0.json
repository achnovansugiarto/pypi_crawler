    "description": "dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record\r\ntypes. It can be used for queries, zone transfers,\r\nand dynamic updates.  It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.\r\n\r\ndnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level classes\r\nperform queries for data of a given name, type, and class, and return an answer\r\nset.  The low level classes allow direct manipulation of DNS zones, messages,\r\nnames, and records.\r\n\r\ndnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate the testing\r\nof DNS software.  Nominum has generously allowed it to be open sourced under a\r\nBSD-style license.",
