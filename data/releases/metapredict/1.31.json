    "description": "# metapredict: A machine learning-based tool for predicting protein disorder.\n\n**metapredict** uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network trained on the consensus disorder values from 8 disorder predictors from 12 proteomes that were obtained from [MobiDB](https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/). The creation of metapredict was made possible by [parrot](https://github.com/idptools/parrot).\n\n## What is metapredict?\n\n**metapredict** is a bit different than your typical protein disorder predictor. Instead of predicting the percent chance that a residue within a sequence might be disordered, metapredict tries to predict the consensus disorder score for the residue. This is because metapredict was trained on **consensus** values from MobiDB. These values are the percent of other disorder predictors that predicted a residue in a sequence to be disordered. For example, if a residue in a sequence has a value of 1 from the MobiDB consensus values, then *all disorder predictors predicted that residue to be disordered*. If the value was 0.5, than half of the predictors predicted that residue to be disordered. In this way, metapredict can help you quickly determine the likelihood that any given sequence is disordered by giving you an approximation of what other predictors would predict (things got pretty 'meta' there, hence the name metapredict).\n\n### In addition to predicting disorder, metapredict also can predict AlphaFold2 confidence scores\n\nIn addition, metapredict offers predicted confidence scores from AlphaFold2. These predicted scores use a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) trained on the per residue pLDDT (predicted IDDT-Ca) confidence scores generated by AlphaFold2 (AF2). The confidence scores from 9 proteomes (151,970 total proteins) were used to train the BRNN used to generate these scores. The confidence scores from the proteomes of *Rattus norvegicus*, *Danio rerio*, *Dictyostelium discoideum*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, *Mus musculus*, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Homo sapiens*, and *Escherichia coli* were used to generate the BRNN. These confidence scores measure the local confidence that AlphaFold2 has in its predicted structure. The scores go from 0-100 where 0 represents low confidence and 100 represents high confidence. For more information, please see: *Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold* https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2. In describing these scores, the team states that regions with pLDDT scores of less than 50 should not be interpreted except as *possible* disordered regions.\n\n\n### What might the predicted confidence scores from AlphaFold2 be used for?\n\nThese scores can be used for many applications such as generating a quick preview of which regions of your protein of interest AF2 might be able to predict with high confidence, or which regions of your protein *might* be disordered. AF2 is not (strictly speaking) a disorder predictor, and the confidence scores are not directly representative of protein disorder. Therefore, any conclusions drawn with regards to disorder from predicted AF2 confidence scores should be interpreted with care, but they may be able to provide an additional metric to assess the likelihood that any given protein region may be disordered.\n\n \n## Why is metapredict useful?\n\nA major drawback of consensus disorder databases is that they can only give you values of *previously predicted protein sequences*. Therefore, if your sequence of interest is not in their database, tough luck. In addition, installing multiple different predictors to generate consensus scores locally is computationally expensive, time consuming, and in some cases simply not possible. Fortunately, **metapredict** gives you a way around this problem!\n\n**metapredict** allows for predicting disorder for any amino acid sequence, and predictions can be output as graphs or as raw values. Additionally, metapredict allows for predicting disorder values for protein sequences from .fasta files either directly in Python or from the command-line. This gives maximum flexibility so the user can easily predict/graph disorder from a single sequence or for an entire proteome.\n\nFor full documentation, please see:\nhttps://metapredict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\n\nFor disorder predictions using our server, please see:\nhttps://metapredict.net\n\n\n## Installation:\n\n**metapredict** is available through PyPI - to install simply run\n\n\t$ pip install metapredict\n\n\nAlternatively, you can get **metapredict** directly from GitHub. \n\nTo clone the GitHub repository and gain the ability to modify a local copy of the code, run\n\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/idptools/metapredict.git\n\t$ cd metapredict\n\t$ pip install .\n\nThis will install **metapredict** locally.\n\n## Usage:\n\nThere are two ways you can use metapredict:\n1. Directly from the command-line\n2. From within Python\n\n## Using metapredict from the command-line:\n\n### Predicting Disorder from a fasta file\n\nThe ``metapredict-predict-disorder`` command from the command line takes a .fasta file as input and returns disorder scores for the sequences in the FASTA file.\n\n\t$ metapredict-predict-disorder <Path to .fasta file>\n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-predict-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta \n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**specifying where to save the output -** \nIf you would like to specify where to save the ouptut, simply use the ``-o`` or ``--output-file`` flag and then specify the file path and file name. By default this command will save the output file as disorder_scores.csv to your current working directory. However, you can specify the file name in the output path.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-predict-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/disorder_predictions/my_disorder_predictions.csv\n\n\n### Predicting Disorder from a sequence\n\n``metapredict-quick-predict`` is a command that will let you input a sequence and get disorder values immediately printed to the terminal. The only argument that can be input is the sequence.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-quick-predict ISQQMQAQPAMVKSQQQQQQQQQQHQHQQQQLQQQQQLQMSQQQVQQQGIYNNGTIAVAN\n\n\n### Predicting AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores from a fasta file\n\nThe ``metapredict-predict-confidence`` command from the command line takes a .fasta file as input and returns predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores for the sequences in the FASTA file.\n\n\t$ metapredict-predict-confidence <Path to .fasta file>\n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-predict-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta \n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Specify where to save the output -** \nIf you would like to specify where to save the ouptut, simply use the ``-o`` or ``--output-file`` flag and then specify the file path. By default this command will save the output file as confidence_scores.csv to your current working directory. However, you can specify the file name in the output path.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-predict-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/disorder_predictions/my_confidence_predictions.csv\n\n\n### Graphing Disorder form a fasta file\n\nThe ``metapredict-graph-disorder`` command from the command line takes a .fasta file as input and returns a graph for every sequence within the .fasta file. **Warning** This will return a graph for every sequence in the FASTA file. \n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-disorder <Path to .fasta file> \n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta \n\nIf no output directory is specified, this function will make an output directory in the current working directory called *disorder_out*. This directory will hold all generated graphs.\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Adding AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores -**\nTo add predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores, simply use the ``-c`` or ``--confidence`` flag.\n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -c\n\n\n**Specifying where to save the output -**\nTo specify where to dave the output, simply use the ``-o`` or ``--output-directory`` flag.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/FolderForCoolPredictions\n\n\n**Changing resolution of saved graphs -**\nBy default, the output graphs have a DPI of 150. However, the user can change the DPI of the output (higher values have greater resolution but take up more space). To change the DPI simply add the flag ``-D`` or ``--dpi`` followed by the wanted DPI value. \n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/DisorderGraphsFolder/ -D 300\n\n\n**Changing the file type -**\nBy default the graphs will save as .png files. However, you can specify the file type by calling ``--filetype`` and then specifying the file type. Any matplotlib compatible file extension should work (for example, pdf).\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/DisorderGraphsFolder/ --filetype pdf\n\n**Indexing file names -**\nIf you would like to index the file names with a leading unique integer starting at 1, use the ``--indexed-filenames`` flag.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/DisorderGraphsFolder/ --indexed-filenames\n\n**Changing the disorder threshhold line on the graph -**\nIf you would like to change the disorder threshold line plotted on the graph, use the ``--disorder-threshold`` flag followed by some value between 0 and 1. Default is 0.3.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-disorder /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/DisorderGraphsFolder/ --disorder-threshold 0.5\n\n\n### Graphing Disorder form a sequence\n\n``metapredict-quick-graph`` is a command that will let you input a sequence and get a plot of the disorder back immediately. You cannot input fasta files for this command. The command only takes three arguments, 1. the sequence 2. *optional* DPI ``-D``  or ``--dpi`` of the ouput graph which defaults to 150 DPI, and 3. *optional* to include predicted AlphaFold2 condience scores, use the ``-c`` or ``--confidence`` flag.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-quick-graph ISQQMQAQPAMVKSQQQQQQQQQQHQHQQQQLQQQQQLQMSQQQVQQQGIYNNGTIAVAN\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-quick-graph ISQQMQAQPAMVKSQQQQQQQQQQHQHQQQQLQQQQQLQMSQQQVQQQGIYNNGTIAVAN -D 200\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-quick-graph ISQQMQAQPAMVKSQQQQQQQQQQHQHQQQQLQQQQQLQMSQQQVQQQGIYNNGTIAVAN -D 200 -c\n\n### Graphing Disorder form a Uniprot ID\n\n``metapredict-uniprot`` is a command that will let you input any Uniprot ID and get a plot of the disorder for the corresponding protein. The default behavior is to have a plot automatically appear. Apart from the Uniprot ID which is required for this command, the command has four possible additional *optional* arguments, 1. To include predicted AlphaFold2 2 confidence scores, use the ``-c``  or ``--confidence`` flag. DPI can be changed with the ``-D``  or ``--dpi`` flags, default is 150 DPI, 3. Using ``-o``  or ``--ourput-file`` will save the plot to a specified directory (default is current directory) - filenames and file extensions (pdf, jpg, png, etc) can be specified here. If there is no file name specified, it will save as the Uniprot ID and as a .png, 4. ``-t``  or ``--title`` will let you specify the title of the plot. By defualt the title will be *Disorder for* followed by the Uniprot ID.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8 -c\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8 -D 300\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8 -o /Users/ThisUser/Desktop/MyFolder/DisorderGraphs\n\n**Example:**\n\n\t$ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8 -o /Users/ThisUser/Desktop/MyFolder/DisorderGraphs/my_graph.png\n\n**Example:**\n\n    $ metapredict-uniprot Q8RYC8 -t ARF19\n\n\n### Graphing Predicted AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores from a fasta file\n\nThe ``metapredict-graph-confidence`` command from the command line takes a .fasta file as input and returns a graph of the predicted AlphaFold2 confidence score for every sequence within the .fasta file. **Warning** This will return a graph for every sequence in the FASTA file. \n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-confidence <Path to .fasta file> \n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta \n\nIf no output directory is specified, this function will make an output directory in the current working directory called *confidence_out*. This directory will hold all generated graphs.\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Specifying where to save the output -**\nTo specify where to dave the output, simply use the ``-o`` or ``--output-directory`` flag.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/FolderForCoolPredictions\n\n\n**Changing resolution of saved graphs -**\nBy default, the output graphs have a DPI of 150. However, the user can change the DPI of the output (higher values have greater resolution but take up more space). To change the DPI simply add the flag ``-D`` or ``--dpi`` followed by the wanted DPI value. \n\n**Example**\n\n\t$ metapredict-graph-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/confidenceGraphsFolder/ -D 300\n\n\n**Changing the file type -**\nBy default the graphs will save as .png files. However, you can specify the file type by calling ``--filetype`` and then specifying the file type. Any matplotlib compatible file extension should work (for example, pdf).\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/confidenceGraphsFolder/ --filetype pdf\n\n**Indexing file names -**\nIf you would like to index the file names with a leading unique integer starting at 1, use the ``--indexed-filenames`` flag.\n\n**Example**\n\n    $ metapredict-graph-confidence /Users/thisUser/Desktop/interestingProteins.fasta -o /Users/thisUser/Desktop/confidenceGraphsFolder/ --indexed-filenames\n\n\n\n\n## Using metapredict in Python:\n\nIn addition to using metapredict from the command line, you can also use metapredict directly in Python.\n\nFirst import metapredict -\n \n\timport metapredict as meta\n\n\nOnce metapredict is imported you can work with individual sequences or .fasta files. \n\n### Predicting Disorder\n\nThe ``predict_disorder`` function will return a list of predicted disorder values for each residue of the input sequence. The input sequence should be a string. Running -\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder(\"DSSPEAPAEPPKDVPHDWLYSYVFLTHHPADFLR\")\n\nwould output -\n\n\t[1, 1, 1, 1, 0.957, 0.934, 0.964, 0.891, 0.863, 0.855, 0.793, 0.719, 0.665, 0.638, 0.576, 0.536, 0.496, 0.482, 0.306, 0.152, 0.096, 0.088, 0.049, 0.097, 0.235, 0.317, 0.341, 0.377, 0.388, 0.412, 0.46, 0.47, 0.545, 0.428]\n\nBy default, output prediction values are normalized between 0 and 1. However, some of the raw values from the predictor are slightly less than 0 or slightly greater than 1. The negative values are simply replaced with 0 and the values greater than 1 are replaced with 1 by default. However, the user can get the raw prediction values by specifying *normalized=False* as a second argument in meta.predict_disorder. There is not a very good reason to do this, and it is generally not recommended. However, we wanted to give users the maximum amount of flexibility when using metapredict, so we made it an option.\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder(\"DAPTSQEHTQAEDKERDSKTHPQKKQSPS\", normalized=False)\n\n### Predicting AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores\n\nThe ``predict_confidence`` function will return a list of predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores  for each residue of the input sequence. The input sequence should be a string. Running -\n\n\tmeta.predict_confidence(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\")\n\nwould output -\n\n\t[35.7925, 40.4579, 46.3753, 46.2976, 42.3189, 42.0248, 43.5976, 40.7481, 40.1676, 41.9618, 43.3977, 43.938, 41.8352, 44.0462, 44.5382, 46.3081, 49.2345, 46.0671]\n\n\n### Predicting Disorder Domains\n\nThe ``predict_disorder_domains`` function takes in an amino acid sequence and returns a 4-position tuple with: 0. the raw disorder scores from 0 to 1 where 1 is the highest probability that a residue is disordered, 1. the smoothed disorder score used for boundary identification, 2. a list of elements where each element is a list where 0 and 1 define the IDR location and 2 gives the actual sequence, and 3. a list of elements where each element is a list where 0 and 1 define the folded domain location and 2 gives the actual sequence\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_domains(\"MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPINSQLWHACAGPLVSLPPVGSLVVYFPQGHSEQVAASMQKQTDFIPNYPNLPSKLICLLHS\")\n\nwould output - \n\n\t[[0.828, 0.891, 0.885, 0.859, 0.815, 0.795, 0.773, 0.677, 0.66, 0.736, 0.733, 0.708, 0.66, 0.631, 0.601, 0.564, 0.532, 0.508, 0.495, 0.458, 0.383, 0.373, 0.398, 0.36, 0.205, 0.158, 0.135, 0.091, 0.09, 0.102, 0.126, 0.129, 0.114, 0.106, 0.097, 0.085, 0.099, 0.114, 0.093, 0.119, 0.117, 0.043, 0.015, 0.05, 0.139, 0.172, 0.144, 0.121, 0.124, 0.128, 0.147, 0.173, 0.129, 0.152, 0.169, 0.2, 0.172, 0.22, 0.216, 0.25, 0.272, 0.308, 0.248, 0.255, 0.301, 0.274, 0.264, 0.28, 0.25, 0.235, 0.221, 0.211, 0.235, 0.185, 0.14, 0.168, 0.307, 0.509, 0.544, 0.402], array([0.87596856, 0.86139124, 0.84596224, 0.82968293, 0.81255466,\n       0.79457882, 0.77575677, 0.75608988, 0.73557951, 0.71422703,\n       0.69203382, 0.66900124, 0.63956894, 0.62124099, 0.60188696,\n       0.57893168, 0.55241615, 0.52131925, 0.4859528 , 0.44109689,\n       0.39353789, 0.35264348, 0.31495776, 0.28      , 0.24661615,\n       0.21469814, 0.18500621, 0.15963478, 0.13604845, 0.1172087 ,\n       0.10798882, 0.1026882 , 0.09419503, 0.08462484, 0.08256398,\n       0.08832671, 0.0908559 , 0.09263851, 0.09438758, 0.09309938,\n       0.09102733, 0.09338137, 0.09665342, 0.10073913, 0.10392671,\n       0.11010311, 0.11402981, 0.11898634, 0.12430683, 0.13169441,\n       0.1381764 , 0.15245093, 0.16746957, 0.17518385, 0.18167578,\n       0.18893043, 0.20013416, 0.21581491, 0.23015652, 0.2420559 ,\n       0.25209814, 0.25817391, 0.26588944, 0.27456894, 0.27429068,\n       0.26411925, 0.24452671, 0.23076894, 0.22834783, 0.21689842,\n       0.20887549, 0.20564427, 0.20856996, 0.21901779, 0.23835296,\n       0.26794071, 0.30914625, 0.36333478, 0.43187154, 0.51612174]), [[0, 20, 'MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPI']], [[20, 80, 'NSQLWHACAGPLVSLPPVGSLVVYFPQGHSEQVAASMQKQTDFIPNYPNLPSKLICLLHS']]]\n\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Altering the disorder theshhold -**\nTo alter the disorder theshold, simply set *disorder_threshold=my_value* where *my_value* is a float. The higher the treshold value, the more conservative metapredict will be for designating a region as disordered. Default = 0.42\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_domains(\"MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPINSQLWHACAGPLV\", disorder_threshold=0.3)\n\n**Altering minimum IDR size -**\nThe minimum IDR size will define the smallest possible region that could be considered an IDR. In other words, you will not be able to get back an IDR smaller than the defined size. Default is 12.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_domains(\"MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPINSQLWHACAGPLV\", minimum_IDR_size = 10)\n\n**Altering the minimum folded domain size -**\nThe minimum folded domain size defines where we expect the limit of small folded domains to be. *NOTE* this is not a hard limit and functions more to modulate the removal of large gaps. In other words, gaps less than this size are treated less strictly. *Note* that, in addition, gaps < 35 are evaluated with a threshold of 0.35 x disorder_threshold and gaps < 20 are evaluated with a threshold of 0.25 x disorder_threshold. These two lengthscales were decided based on the fact that coiled-coiled regions (which are IDRs in isolation) often show up with reduced apparent disorder within IDRs but can be as short as 20-30 residues. The folded_domain_threshold is used based on the idea that it allows a 'shortest reasonable' folded domain to be identified. Default=50.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_domains(\"MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPINSQLWHACAGPLV\", minimum_folded_domain = 60)\n\n**Altering gap_closure -**\nThe gap closure defines the largest gap that would be closed. Gaps here refer to a scenario in which you have two groups of disordered residues seprated by a 'gap' of not disordered residues. In general large gap sizes will favour larger contigous IDRs. It's worth noting that gap_closure becomes relevant only when minimum_region_size becomes very small (i.e. < 5) because really gaps emerge when the smoothed disorder fit is \"noisy\", but when smoothed gaps are increasingly rare. Default=10.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_domains(\"MKAPSNGFLPSSNEGEKKPINSQLWHACAGPLV\", gap_closure = 5)\n\n### Predicting Disorder Domains using a Uniprot ID\n\nIn addition to inputting a sequence, you can predict disorder domains by inputting a Uniprot ID by using the ``predict_disorder_domains_uniprot`` function. This function has the exact same functionality as ``predict_disorder_domains`` except you can now input a Uniprot ID. \n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.predict_disorder_domains_uniprot('Q8N6T3')\n\n\n### Graphing Disorder \n\nThe ``graph_disorder`` function will show a plot of the predicted disorder consensus values across the input amino acid sequence.\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder(\"DAPTSQEHTQAEDKERDSKTHPQKKQSPS\")\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Adding Predicted AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores -**\nTo add predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores, simply specify *confidence_scores=True*.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder(\"DAPTSQEHTQAEDKERDSKTHPQKKQSPS\", confidence_scores=True)\n\n\n**Changing the title of the generated graph -**\nThere are two parameters that the user can change for graph_disorder. The first is the name of the title for the generated graph. The name by default is blank and the title of the graph is simply *Predicted protein disorder*. However, the title can be specified by specifing *title* = \"my cool title\" would result in a title of *my cool title*.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", title=\"Name of this nonexistant protein\")\n\n**Changing the resolution of the generated graph -**\nBy default, the output graph has a DPI of 150. However, the user can change the DPI of the generated graph (higher values have greater resolution). To do so, simply specify *DPI=\"Number\"* where the number is an integer.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", DPI=300)\n\n**Changing the disorder threshold line -**\nThe disorder threshold line for graphs defaults to 0.3. However, if you want to change where the line designating the disorder cutoff is, simply specify *disorder_threshold = Float* where Float is some decimal value between 0 and 1. \n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", disorder_threshold=0.5)\n\n**Adding shaded regions to the graph -** If you would like to shade specific regions of your generated graph (perhaps shade the disordered regions), you can specify *shaded_regions=[[list of regions]]* where the list of regions is a list of lists that defines the regions to shade.\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERDDAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERDDAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", shaded_regions=[[1, 20], [30, 40]])\n\nIn addition, you can specify the color of the shaded regions by specifying *shaded_region_color*. The default for this is red. You can specify any matplotlib color or a hex color string.\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERDDAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERDDAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", shaded_regions=[[1, 20], [30, 40]], shaded_region_color=\"blue\")\n\n**Saving the graph -** By default, the graph will automatically appear. However, you can also save the graph if you'd like. To do this, simply specify *output_file = path_where_to_save/filename.file_extension.* For example, output_file=/Users/thisUser/Desktop/cool_graphs/myCoolGraph.png. You can save the file with any valid matplotlib extension (.png, .pdf, etc.). \n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKER\", output_file=/Users/thisUser/Desktop/cool_graphs/myCoolGraph.png)\n\n### Graphing AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores\n\nThe ``graph_confidence`` function will show a plot of the predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores across the input amino acid sequence.\n\n\tmeta.graph_confidence(\"DAPTSQEHTQAEDKERDSKTHPQKKQSPS\")\n\nThis function has all of the same functionality as ``graph_disorder``.\n\n### Calculating Percent Disorder\n\nThe ``percent_disorder`` function will return the percent of residues in a sequence that  have predicted consensus disorder values of 30% or more (as a decimal value).\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.percent_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\")\n\nBy default, this function uses a cutoff value of equal to or greater than 0.3 for a residue to be considered disordered.\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Changing the cutoff value -**\nIf you want to be more strict in what you consider to be disordered for calculating percent disorder of an input sequence, you can simply specify the cutoff value by adding the argument *cutoff=decimal* where the decimal corresponds to the percent you would like to use as the cutoff (for example, 0.8 would be 80%).\n\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.percent_disorder(\"DAPPTSQEHTQAEDKERD\", cutoff=0.8)\n\nThe higher the cutoff value, the higher the value any given predicted residue must be greater than or equal to in order to be considered disordered when calculating the final percent disorder for the input sequence.\n\n\n### Predicting Disorder From a .fasta File\n\nBy using the ``predict_disorder_fasta`` function, you can predict disorder values for the amino acid sequences in a .fasta file. By default, this function will return a dictionary where the keys in the dictionary are the fasta headers and the values are the consensus disorder predictions of the amino acid sequence associated with each fasta header in the original .fasta file.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_fasta(\"file path to .fasta file/fileName.fasta\")\n\nAn actual filepath would look something like:\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\")\n\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Save the output values -**\nBy default the predict_disorder_fasta function will immediately return a dictionary. However, you can also save the output to a .csv file by specifying *output_file = \"location you want to save the file to*\". When specifying the file path, you also want to specify the file name. The first cell of each row will contain a fasta header and the subsequent cells in that row will contain predicted consensus disorder values for the protein associated with the fasta header.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_fasta(\"file path to .fasta file/fileName.fasta\", output_file=\"file path where the output .csv should be saved\")\n\nAn actual filepath would look something like:\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", output_file=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/cool_predictions.csv\")\n\n\n**Get raw prediction values -**\nBy default, this function will output prediction values that are normalized between 0 and 1. However, some of the raw values from the predictor are slightly less than 0 or slightly greater than 1. The negative values are simply replaced with 0 and the values greater than 1 are replaced with 1 by default. If you want the raw values simply specify *normalized=False*. There is not a very good reason to do this, and it is generally not recommended. However, we wanted to give users the maximum amount of flexibility when using metapredict, so we made it an option.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", normalized=False)\n\n\n### Predicting AlphaFold2 confidence scores From a .fasta File\n\nJust like with ``predict_disorder_fasta``, you can use ``predict_confidence_fasta`` to get predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores from a fasta file. All the same functionality in ``predict_disorder_fasta`` is in ``predict_confidence_fasta``.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.predict_confidence_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\")\n\n\n### Predict Disorder Using Uniprot ID\nBy using the ``predict_disorder_uniprot`` function, you can return predicted consensus disorder values for the amino acid sequence of a protein by specifying the Uniprot ID. \n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.predict_disorder_uniprot(\"Q8N6T3\")\n\n\n### Predicting AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores Using Uniprot ID\n\nBy using the ``predict_confidence_uniprot`` function, you can generate predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores by inputting a Uniprot ID.\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.predict_confidence_uniprot('P16892')\n\n\n### Generating Disorder Graphs From a .fasta File\n\nBy using the ``graph_disorder_fasta`` function, you can graph predicted consensus disorder values for the amino acid sequences in a .fasta file. The *graph_disorder_fasta* function takes a .fasta file as input and by default will return the graphs immediately. However, you can specify *output_dir=path_to_save_files* which result in a a .png file saved to that directory for every sequence within the .fasta file. You cannot specify the output file name here! By default, the file name will be the first 14 characters of the FASTA header followed by the filetype as specified by filetype. If you wish for the files to include a unique leading number (i.e. X_rest_of_name where X starts at 1 and increments) then set *indexed_filenames = True*. This can be useful if you have sequences where the 1st 14 characters may be identical, which would otherwise overwrite an output file. By default this will return a single graph for every sequence in the FASTA file. \n\n**WARNING -**\nThis command will generate a graph for ***every*** sequence in the .fasta file. If you have 1,000 sequences in a .fasta file and you do not specify the *output_dir*, it will generate **1,000** graphs that you will have to close sequentially. Therefore, I recommend specifying the *output_dir* such that the output is saved to a dedicated folder.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"file path to .fasta file/fileName.fasta\", output_dir=\"file path of where to save output graphs\")\n\nAn actual filepath would look something like:\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", output_dir=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/folderForGraphs\")\n\n\n**Additional Usage**\n\n**Adding Predicted AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores -**\nTo add predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores, simply specify *confidence_scores=True*.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", confidence_scores=True)\n\n\n**Changing resolution of saved graphs -**\nBy default, the output files have a DPI of 150. However, the user can change the DPI of the output files (higher values have greater resolution but take up more space). To change the DPI, specify *DPI=Number* where Number is an integer.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", DPI=300, output_dir=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/folderForGraphs\")\n\n**Changing the output File Type -** \nBy default ths output file is a .png. However, you can specify the output file type by using *output_filetype=\"file_type\"* where file_type is some matplotlib compatible file type (such as .pdf).\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", output_dir=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/folderForGraphs\", output_filetype = \"pdf\")\n\n\n**Indexing generated files -**\nIf you would like to index the file names with a leading unique integer starting at 1, set *indexed_filenames=True*.\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", output_dir=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/folderForGraphs\", indexed_filenames=True)\n\n\n### Generating AlphaFold2 Confidence Score Graphs from fasta files\n\nBy using the ``graph_confidence_fasta`` function, you can graph predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores for the amino acid sequences in a .fasta file. This works the same as ``graph_disorder_fasta`` but instead returns graphs with just the predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_confidence_fasta(\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/coolSequences.fasta\", output_dir=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/folderForGraphs\")\n\n\n### Generating Predicted Disorder Graphs Using Uniprot ID\n\nBy using the ``graph_disorder_uniprot`` function, you can graph predicted consensus disorder values for the amino acid sequence of a protein by specifying the Uniprot ID. \n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder_uniprot(\"Q8N6T3\")\n\nThis function carries all of the same functionality as ``graph_disorder`` including specifying disorder_threshold, title of the graph, the DPI, and whether or not to save the output.\n\n**Example**\n\n    meta.graph_disorder_uniprot(\"Q8N6T3\", disorder_threshold=0.5, title=\"my protein\", DPI=300, output_file=\"/Users/thisUser/Desktop/my_cool_graph.png\")\n\n**Additional usage**\n\n**Adding Predicted AlphaFold2 Confidence Scores -**\nTo add predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores, simply specify *confidence_scores=True*.\n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_disorder_uniprot(\"Q8N6T3\", confidence_scores=True)\n\n### Generating AlphaFold2 Confidnce Score Graphs Using Uniprot ID\n\nJust like with disorder predictions, you can also get AlphaFold2 confidence score graphs using the Uniprot ID. This will **only display the confidence scores** and not the predicted disorder scores. \n\n**Example**\n\n\tmeta.graph_confidence_uniprot(\"Q8N6T3\")\n\n\n### metapredict isn't working!\n\nI have recieved occassional feedback that metapredict is not working for a user. A common problem is that the user is using a different version of Python than metapredict was made on. metapredict was made using Python version 3.7, and I recommend using this version while using metapredict to avoid problems (I haven't done extensive testing using other versions of Python, so if you're not using 3.7, do so at your own risk). A convenient workaround is to use a conda environment that has Python 3.7 set as the default version of Python. For more info on conda, please see https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html\n\nOnce you have conda installed, simply use the command \n\n\tconda create --name my_env python=3.7\n\nwhere you can replace the name of your environment with whatever you'd like. Then, use metapredict from within this conda environment.\n\nIf you are having other problems, please report them to the **issues** section on the metapredict Github page at\nhttps://github.com/idptools/metapredict/issues\n\n### Known Installation/Execution Issues\n\nBelow we include documentation on known issues. \n\nmacOS libiomp clash \n\nPyTorch current ships with its own version of the OpenMP library (``libiomp.dylib``). Unfortunately when numpy is installed from ``conda`` (although not from ``pip``) this leads to a collision because the ``conda``-derived numpy library also includes a local copy of the ``libiomp5.dylib`` library. This leads to the following error message (included here for google-ability).\n\n\n   OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.\n   OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. \n   That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to \n   do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static \n   linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you \n   can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, \n   but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, \n   please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.\n\nTo avoid this error we make the executive decision to ignore this clash. This has largely not appeared to have any deleterious issues on performance or accuracy accross the tests run. If you are uncomfortable with this then the code in ``metapredict/__init__.py`` can be edited with ``IGNORE_LIBOMP_ERROR`` set to ``False`` and **metapredict** re-installed from the source directory.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo see if your installation of **metapredict** is working properly, you can run the unit test included in the package by navigating to the metapredict/tests folder within the installation directory and\n\n**running:**\n\n    $ pytest -v\n\n\n### Example Datasets\n\nExample data that can be used with metapredict can be found in the metapredict/data folder on GitHub. The example data set is just a .fasta file containing 5 protein sequences.\n\n\n### Recent changes\n\nThis section is a log of recent changes with metapredict. My hope is that as I change things, this section can help you figure out why a change was made and if it will break any of your current work flows. The first major changes were made for the 0.56 release, so tracking will start there. Reasons are not provided for bug fixes for because the reason can assumed to be fixing the bug...\n\n#### V1.3\n\nChange:\nAdded functionality to generate predicted AlphaFold2 confidence scores. Can get scores or generate graphs from Python or command-line. Can also generate graphs with both predicted disorder and predicted confidence scores. Also added functionality to predict disorder domains using scores from a different disorder predictor. \n\n#### V1.2\n\nChange:\nMajor update. Changed some basic functionality. Made it such that you don't need to specify to save (for disorder prediction values or graphs). Rather, if a file path is specified, the files will be saved. Updated graphing functionality to allow for specifying the disorder cutoff line and to allow users to highlight various regions of the graph. Changed import such that you can now just use import metapredict as meta in Python (as opposed to import metapredict and then from metapredict import meta). Lots of backend changes to make metapredict more stable. Added additional testing. Updated documentation. Standardized file reading/writing. Made it so user can specify file type of saved graphs. Added backend meta_tools.py to handle the busywork. Changed version numbering for networks. Updated code to avoid OMPLIB issue (known bug in previous versions). Updated all command-line tools to match backend code.\n\n#### V1.1\n\nChange:\nFixed some bugs.\n\n#### V1.0\n\nChange:\nAdded functionality to generate graphs using a Uniprot ID as the input from command line. Added functionality to predict disorder domains. Added functionality to predict/graph disorder and predict disorder domains using a Uniprot ID from Python. Updated tests to include testing new functionality.\n\n\n#### V0.61\n\nChange:\nAdded functionality to predict or graph a disordered sequence from the command line by directly inputting the sequence. This can only do one sequence at a time and does not save the disorder values or graph. It is meant to provide a very quick and easy way to check something out.\n\n#### V0.60\n\nChange:\nAdded functionality to specify the horizontal lines that appear across the graphs rather than only having the option of having the dashed lines appear at intervals of 0.2. This functionality is in both Python and the command line.\n\n#### V0.58\n\nChange:\nUpdated the network with a newly trained network (using the same dataset as the original) that is slightly more accurate.\n\nReason:\nI am always trying to find ways to make metapredict more accurate. When I manage to make the predictor better, I will update it.\n\n#### V0.57\n\nChange:\nBug fix that could result in prediction values to six decimal places in some scenarios\n\nChange:\nChanged titles for graphs generated by ``metapredict-graph-disorder`` to be 14 characters instead of 10. This is reflected in the title graph and the saved files.\n\nReason:\nThe 10 character save file was occasionally the same for multiple proteins. This resulted in the inability to discern which protein corresponded to which graph and could result in overwriting previously generated graphs. The 14 characters should be long enough to keep unique names for all proteins being analyzed.\n\nChange:\nFixed bug that could result in crashing due to short fasta headers.\n\n\n#### V0.56\n\nChange:\nNumber of decimals in predictions was reduced from 6 to 3.\n\nReason:\nIt is not necessary to have accuracy out to 6 decimal places.\n\nChange:\nAdded functionality to use . to specify current directory from command line.\n\nReason:\nImprove functionality.\n\nChange:\n-DPI flag changed to -dpi in command line graphing function\n\nReason:\nIt was annoying to have to do all caps for this flag.\n\nChange:\nThe ``predict-disorder`` command is now ``metapredict-predict-disorder`` and the ``graph-disorder`` command is now ``metapredict-graph-disorder``\n\nReason:\nThis will help users be able to use auto complete functionality from the command line using tab to pull up the graph or predict disorder commands while only having to remember metapredict.\n\nChange:\nThe output for .csv files will now have a comma space between each value instead of just a comma.\n\nReason:\nImprove readability.\n\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021, Holehouse Lab - WUSM\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nIDP-Parrot, created by Dan Griffith, was used to generate the network used for metapredict.
