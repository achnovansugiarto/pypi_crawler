    "description": "MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.\n\n.. image:: https://mapproxy.org/mapproxy.png\n\nMapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.\n\nMapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <https://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.\n\nGo to https://mapproxy.org/ for more information.\n\nThe documentation is available at: https://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/\n\nChanges\n-------\n1.11.1 2019-08-06\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue in demo service. Fix for #322 did not\n  properly escaped input used in JavaScript examples.\n\n  A targeted attack could be used for information disclosure. For\n  example: Session cookies of a third party application running on\n  the same domain.\n\n1.11.0 2017-11-20\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Improve reprojection performance and accuracy.\n- ArcGIS compact cache: Support for version 2.\n- ArcGIS compact cache: Improve performance for version 1.\n- ArcGIS compact cache: Add ``mapproxy-util defrag`` to reduce bundle size\n  after tiles were removed/updated.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Support opts.map and seed_only.\n- Use systems CA certs by default and fix ssl_no_cert_checks\n  for Python >=2.7.9 and >=3.4\n- WMS: Improve Bounding Boxes in Capabilities.\n- Mapserver: Find mapserv binary in PATH environment.\n\nFixes:\n\n- Seed: Always show last log line (100%).\n- Fix saving transparent PNGs for some versions of Pillow\n  (workaround for Pillow bug #2633)\n- SQLite: Fix possible errors on first request after start.\n- Demo: Fix demo client with `use_grid_names`.\n- serve-develop: Fix header encoding for Python 3.\n- Seed: Fix --interactive for Python 3.\n- Support tagged layers for sources with colons in name.\n- Support # character in Basis Authentication password.\n- Fix import error with shapely>=1.6\n- Fix duplicate level caches when using WMTS KVP with MBtile/SQLite/CouchDB.\n\nOther:\n\n- Remove support for Python 2.6\n\n1.10.4 2017-08-17\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue in demo service (#322).\n  A targeted attack could be used for information disclosure. For\n  example: Session cookies of a third party application running on\n  the same domain.\n\n\n1.10.3 2017-07-07\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix crash during clipping\n- Fix bilinear/bicubic resampling from cropped source\n- Fix loading empty coverages\n\n1.10.2 2017-06-21\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix coverage clipping for caches with a single source\n\n1.10.1 2017-06-06\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix mapproxy-util serve-develop for Python 3.6 on Windows\n- Fix OGR coverages on Windows with Python 3 and official OGR Python bindings\n- Fix --repeat option of mapproxy-util scales\n\n1.10.0 2017-05-18\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Support for S3 cache.\n- Support for the ArcGIS Compact Cache format version 1.\n- Support for GeoPackage files.\n- Support for Redis cache.\n- Support meta_tiles for tiles sources with bulk_meta_tiles option.\n- mbtiles/sqlite cache: Store multiple tiles in one transaction.\n- mbtiles/sqlite cache: Make timeout and WAL configurable.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Improve handling for ImageServer endpoints.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Support FeatureInfo requests.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Support min_res and max_res.\n- Support merging of RGB images with fixed transparency.\n- Coverages: Clip source requests at coverage boundaries.\n- Coverages: Build the difference, union or intersection of multiple coverages.\n- Coverages: Create coverages from webmercator tile coordinates like 05/182/123\n  with expire tiles files.\n- Coverages: Add native support for GeoJSON (no OGR/GDAL required).\n- mapproxy-seed: Add --duration, -reseed-file and -reseed-interval options.\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix level selection for grids with small res_factor.\n- mapproxy-util scales: Fix for Python 3.\n- WMS: Fix FeatureInfo precision for transformed requests.\n- Auth-API: Fix FeatureInfo for layers with limitto.\n- Fixes subpixel transformation deviations with Pillow 3.4 or higher.\n- mapproxy-seed: Reduce log output, especially in --quiet mode.\n- mapproxy-seed: Improve tile counter for tile grids with custom resolutions.\n- mapproxy-seed: Improve saving of the seed progress for --continue.\n- Fix band-merging when not all sources return an image.\n\nOther:\n\n- Python 2.6 is no longer supported.\n\n\n\nOlder changes\n-------------\nSee https://raw.github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy/master/CHANGES.txt",
