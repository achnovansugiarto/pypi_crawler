    "description": "MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.\n\n.. image:: http://mapproxy.org/mapproxy.png\n\nMapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.\n\nMapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.\n\nGo to http://mapproxy.org/ for more information.\n\nThe documentation is available at: http://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/\n\nChanges\n-------\n1.5.0 2012-12-05\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- read remove_before/refresh_before timestamp from file\n- add --concurrency option to mapproxy-utils export\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed where option for coverages (renamed from ogr_where)\n- only write seed progess with --continue or --progress-file option\n\nOther:\n\n- add EPSG:3857 to WMS default SRSs and remove UTM/GK\n- remove import error warning for shapely\n- create metadata table in MBTiles caches\n\n1.5.0rc1 2012-11-19\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- clipping of tile request to polygon geometries in security API\n- WMTS support in security API\n- mixed_image mode that automatically chooses between PNG/JPEG\n- use caches as source for other caches\n- `mapproxy-util grids` tool to analyze grid configurations\n- `mapproxy-util wms-capabilities` tool\n- `mapproxy-util export` tool\n- use_grid_names option to access Tiles/TMS/KML layers by grid\n  name instead of EPSGXXXX\n- origin option for TMS to change default origin of the /tiles service\n- continue stopped/interrupted seed processes\n- support min_res/max_res for tile sources\n\nImprovements:\n\n- do not show layers with incompatible grids in WMTS/TMS demo\n- make 0/0/0.kml optional for the initial KML file\n- use BBOX of coverage for capabilities in seed_only layers\n- ignore debug layer when loading tile layers\n- simplified coverage configuration\n- add reloader option to make_wsgi_app()\n- add MetadataURL to WMS 1.1.1 capabilities\n- improved WMTS services with custom grids (origin)\n- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client\n- larger map in demo client\n- always request with transparent=true in WMS demo client\n- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed reloading of multiapps in threaded servers\n- fixed BBOX check for single tile requests\n- fixed TMS for caches with watermarks\n- fixed limited_to clipping for single layer requests with service-wide\n  clipping geometries\n- fixed WMTS RESTful template\n\nOther:\n\n- deprecated `origin` option for tile sources was removed\n- empty tiles are now returned as PNG even if requested as .jpeg\n\n\n1.4.0 2012-05-15\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- fix TypeError exception when auth callback returns {authorized:'full'}\n- use MAPPROXY_LIB_PATH on platforms other that win32 and darwin\n- raise config error for mapnik sources when mapnik could not be imported\n\n1.4.0rc1 2012-05-02\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- support clipping of requests to polygon geometries in security API\n- support for WMS 1.3.0 extended layer capabilities\n- on_error handling for tile sources. fallback to empty/transparent\n  tiles when the source returns HTTP codes like 404 or 204\n- add HTTP Cache-Control header to WMS-C responses\n\nImprovements:\n\n- WMS source requests and requests to cached tiles are now clipped\n  to the extent. this should prevent projection errors when requesting\n  large bbox (e.g. over 180/90 in EPSG:4326)\n- improved lock timeouts in mapproxy-seed\n- the debug source does not overwrite the layer extent anymore.\n  makes it more usable in demo/wms clients\n- support for multiple files and recursion in base option\n- mapproxy-seed ETA output is now more responsive to changes in seed speed\n- improved demo service\n  - choose different SRS for WMS layers\n  - support for WMTS\n\nFixes:\n\n- support loading of WKT polygon files with UTF8 encoding and BOM header\n- upgraded dictspec module with fix for some nested configuration specs.\n  a bug prevented checking of the layers configuration\n\nOther:\n\n- the documentation now contains a tutorial\n- old layer configuration syntax is now deprecated\n- EPSG:4326/900913/3857 are now always initialized with the +over proj4\n  option to prevent distortions at the dateline\n  see: http://fwarmerdam.blogspot.de/2010/02/world-mapping.html\n\n1.3.0 2012-01-13\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNo changes since 1.3.0b1\n\n1.3.0b1 2012-01-03\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- support for RESTful WMTS requests with custom URL templates\n- support for CouchDB as tile backend\n- support for Mapnik 2 sources\n- limit maximum WMS response size with max_output_pixels\n- new color option for watermarks\n- new ``mapproxy-util serve-multiapp-develop`` command\n- new wms.bbox_srs option for bounding boxes in multiple SRS in WMS\n  capabilities\n\nImprovements:\n\n- log exceptions when returning internal errors (500)\n\nFixes:\n\n- fix BBOX in WMS-C capabilities\n- prevent exception for WMS requests with unsupported image formats with\n  mime-type options (like 'image/png; mode=24bit')\n- fixed blank image results for servers that call .close() on the\n  response (like gunicorn)\n\nOther:\n\n- origin option for tile sources is deprecated. use a custom grid with\n  the appropriate origin.\n\n1.2.1 2011-09-01\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed configuration of watermarks\n- support for unicode title in old-style layer configuration\n\n\nOlder changes\n-------------\nSee https://bitbucket.org/olt/mapproxy/src/default/CHANGES.txt",
