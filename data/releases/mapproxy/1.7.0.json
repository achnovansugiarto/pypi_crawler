    "description": "MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.\n\n.. image:: http://mapproxy.org/mapproxy.png\n\nMapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.\n\nMapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.\n\nGo to http://mapproxy.org/ for more information.\n\nThe documentation is available at: http://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/\n\nChanges\n-------\n1.7.0 2014-07-07\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- new `mapproxy-util autoconf` tool\n- new versions option to limit supported WMS versions\n-

serve-develop\n- improve combining of multiple cascaded sources\n- respect order of --seed/--cleanup tasks\n- catch and log sqlite3.OperationalError when storing tiles\n- do not open cascaded responses when image format matches\n- mapproxy-seed: retry longer if source fails (100 instead of 10)\n- mapproxy-seed: give more details if source request fails\n- mapproxy-seed: do not hang nor print traceback if seed ends\n  after permanent source errors\n- mapproxy-seed: skip seeds/cleanups with empty coverages\n- keep order of image_formats in WMS capabilities\n\n\nFixes:\n\n- handle errors when loading to many tiles from mbtile/sqlite in\n  one batch\n- reduce memory when handling large images\n- allow remove_all for mbtiles cleanups\n- use extent from layer metadata in WMTS

username and password\n- try to load pyproj before using libproj.dll on Windows\n- support for GDAL python module (osgeo.ogr) besides using gdal.so/dll\n  directly\n- files are now written atomical to support concurrent access\n  to the same tile cache from different servers (e.g. via NFS)\n- support for WMS 1.3.0 in mapproxy-util wms-capabilities\n- support layer merge for 8bit PNGs\n- support for OGR/GDAL 1.10\n- show TMS root resource at /tms\n\nFixes:\n\n- support requests>=1.0 for CouchDB cache\n- HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST can be a list of hosts\n- fixed KML for caches with origin: nw\n- fixed 'I/O operation on closed file' errors\n- fixed memory leak when reloading large configurations\n- improve handling of mixed grids/formats when using caches as\n  cache sources\n- threading related crashes in coverage handling\n- close OGR sources\n- catch IOErrors when PIL/Pillow can't identify image file\n\nOther:\n\n- update example configuration (base-config)\n- update deployment documentation\n- update OpenLayers version in demo service\n- use restful_template URL in WMTS demo\n- update MANIFEST.in to prevent unnecessary warnings during installation\n- accept Pillow as depencendy instead of PIL when already installed\n- deprecate use_mapnik2 option\n\n1.5.0 2012-12-05\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- read remove_before/refresh_before timestamp from file\n- add --concurrency option to mapproxy-utils export\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed where option for coverages (renamed from ogr_where)\n- only write seed progess with --continue or --progress-file option\n\nOther:\n\n- add EPSG:3857 to WMS default SRSs and remove UTM/GK\n- remove import error warning for shapely\n- create metadata table in MBTiles caches\n\n1.5.0rc1 2012-11-19\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- clipping of tile request to polygon geometries in security API\n- WMTS support in security API\n- mixed_image mode that automatically chooses between PNG/JPEG\n- use caches as source for other caches\n- `mapproxy-util grids` tool to analyze grid configurations\n- `mapproxy-util wms-capabilities` tool\n- `mapproxy-util export` tool\n- use_grid_names option to access Tiles/TMS/KML layers by grid\n  name instead of EPSGXXXX\n- origin option for TMS to change default origin of the /tiles service\n- continue stopped/interrupted seed processes\n-

client\n- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed reloading of multiapps in threaded servers\n- fixed BBOX check for single tile requests\n- fixed TMS for caches with watermarks\n- fixed limited_to clipping for single layer requests with service-wide\n  clipping geometries\n- fixed WMTS RESTful template\n\nOther:\n\n- deprecated `origin` option for tile sources was removed\n- empty tiles are now returned as PNG even if requested as .jpeg\n\n\n1.4.0 2012-05-15\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- fix TypeError exception when auth callback returns {authorized:'full'}\n- use MAPPROXY_LIB_PATH on platforms other that win32 and darwin\n- raise config error for mapnik sources when mapnik could not be imported\n\n1.4.0rc1 2012-05-02\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- support clipping of requests to polygon geometries in security API\n- support for WMS 1.3.0 extended layer capabilities\n- on_error handling for tile sources. fallback to empty/transparent\n  tiles when the source returns HTTP codes like 404 or 204\n- add HTTP Cache-Control header to WMS-C responses\n\nImprovements:\n\n- WMS source requests and requests to cached tiles are now clipped\n  to the extent. this should prevent projection errors when requesting\n  large bbox (e.g. over 180/90 in EPSG:4326)\n- improved lock timeouts in mapproxy-seed\n- the debug source does not overwrite the layer extent anymore.\n  makes it more usable in demo/wms clients\n- support for multiple files and recursion in base option\n- mapproxy-seed ETA output is now more responsive to changes in seed speed\n- improved demo service\n  - choose different SRS for WMS layers\n  - support for WMTS\n\nFixes:\n\n- support loading of WKT polygon files with UTF8 encoding and BOM header\n- upgraded dictspec module with fix for some nested configuration specs.\n  a bug prevented checking of the layers configuration\n\nOther:\n\n- the documentation now contains a tutorial\n- old layer configuration syntax is now deprecated\n- EPSG:4326/900913/3857 are now always initialized with the +over proj4\n  option to prevent distortions at the dateline\n
