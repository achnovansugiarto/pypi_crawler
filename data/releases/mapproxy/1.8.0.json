    "description": "MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.\n\n.. image:: http://mapproxy.org/mapproxy.png\n\nMapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.\n\nMapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.\n\nGo to http://mapproxy.org/ for more information.\n\nThe documentation is available at: http://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/\n\nChanges\n-------\n1.8.0 2015-05-18\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Support for Python 3.3 or newer\n\nImprovements:\n\n- WMS is now available at /service, /ows and /wms\n- WMTS KVP is now available at /service and /ows, RESTful service at /wmts\n- allow tiled access to layers with multiple map:false sources\n- add Access-control-allow-origin header to HTTP responses\n- list KVP and RESTful capabilities on demo page\n- disable verbose seed output if stdout is not a tty\n- add globals.cache.link_single_color_images option\n- support scale_factor for

capabilities in demo for TMS with use_grid_names\n- fix ctrl+c behaviour in mapproxy-seed\n- fix BBOX parsing in autoconf for WMS 1.3.0 services\n\nOther:\n\n- 1.8.0 is expected to work with Python 2.6, but it is no longer officially supported\n- MapProxy will now issue warnings about configurations that will change with 2.0.\n  doc/mapproxy_2.rst lists some of the planed incompatible changes\n\n1.7.1 2014-07-08\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- fix startup of mapproxy-util when libgdal/geos is missing\n\n\n1.7.0 2014-07-07\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- new `mapproxy-util

name\n- check included files (base) for changes in reloader and serve-develop\n- improve combining of multiple cascaded sources\n- respect order of --seed/--cleanup tasks\n- catch and log sqlite3.OperationalError when storing tiles\n- do not open cascaded responses when image format matches\n- mapproxy-seed: retry longer if source fails (100 instead of 10)\n- mapproxy-seed: give more details if source request fails\n- mapproxy-seed: do not hang nor print traceback if seed ends\n  after permanent source errors\n- mapproxy-seed: skip seeds/cleanups with empty coverages\n- keep order of image_formats in WMS capabilities\n\n\nFixes:\n\n- handle errors when loading to many tiles from mbtile/sqlite in\n  one batch\n- reduce memory when handling large images\n- allow remove_all for mbtiles cleanups\n- use extent from layer metadata in WMTS capabilities\n- handle threshold_res higher than first resolution\n- fix exception handling in Mapnik source\n- only init libproj when requested\n\nOther:\n\n- 1.7.x is the last release with support for Python 2.5\n- depend on Pillow if PIL is not installed\n\n1.6.0 2013-09-12\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Riak cache supports multiple nodes\n\nFixes:\n\n- handle SSL verification when using HTTP proxy\n- ignore errors during single color symlinking\n\nOther:\n\n- --debug option for serve-multiapp-develop\n- Riak cache requires Riak-Client >=2.0\n\n1.6.0rc1 2013-08-15\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- new `sqlite` cache with timestamps and one DB for each zoom level\n- new `riak` cache\n- first dimension support for WMTS (cascaded only)\n- support HTTP Digest Authentication for source requests\n- remove_all option for seed cleanups\n- use real alpha composite for merging layers with transparent\n  backgrounds\n- new tile_lock_dir option to write tile locks outside of the cache dir\n- new decorate image API\n- new GLOBAL_WEBMERCATOR grid with origin:nw and EPSG:3857\n\nImprovements:\n\n- speed up configuration loading with tagged sources\n- speed up seeding with sparse coverages and limited levels\n  (e.g. only level 17-20)\n- add required params to WMS URL in mapproxy-util wms-capabilities\n- support for `@` and `:` in HTTP username and password\n- try to load pyproj before using libproj.dll on Windows\n- support for GDAL python module (osgeo.ogr) besides using gdal.so/dll\n  directly\n- files are now written atomical to support concurrent access\n  to the same tile cache from different servers (e.g. via NFS)\n- support for WMS 1.3.0 in mapproxy-util wms-capabilities\n- support layer merge for 8bit PNGs\n- support for OGR/GDAL 1.10\n- show TMS root resource at /tms\n\nFixes:\n\n- support requests>=1.0 for CouchDB cache\n- HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST can

request with transparent=true in WMS demo client\n- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client\n\nFixes:\n\n- fixed reloading of multiapps in threaded servers\n- fixed BBOX check for single tile requests\n- fixed TMS for caches with watermarks\n- fixed limited_to clipping for single layer requests with service-wide\n  clipping geometries\n- fixed WMTS RESTful template\n\nOther:\n\n-
