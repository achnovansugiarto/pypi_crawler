    "description": "MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.\n\n.. image:: https://mapproxy.org/mapproxy.png\n\nMapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.\n\nMapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <https://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.\n\nGo to https://mapproxy.org/ for more information.\n\nThe documentation is available at: https://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/\n\nChanges\n-------\n1.10.0 2017-05-18\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Support for S3 cache.\n- Support for the ArcGIS Compact Cache format version 1.\n- Support for GeoPackage files.\n- Support for Redis cache.\n- Support meta_tiles for tiles sources with bulk_meta_tiles option.\n- mbtiles/sqlite cache: Store multiple tiles in one transaction.\n- mbtiles/sqlite cache: Make timeout and WAL configurable.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Improve handling for ImageServer endpoints.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Support FeatureInfo requests.\n- ArcGIS REST source: Support min_res and max_res.\n- Support merging of RGB images with fixed transparency.\n- Coverages: Clip source requests at coverage boundaries.\n- Coverages: Build the difference, union or intersection of multiple coverages.\n- Coverages: Create coverages from webmercator tile coordinates like 05/182/123\n  with expire tiles files.\n- Coverages: Add native support for GeoJSON (no OGR/GDAL required).\n- mapproxy-seed: Add --duration, -reseed-file and -reseed-interval options.\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix level selection for grids with small res_factor.\n- mapproxy-util scales: Fix for Python 3.\n- WMS: Fix FeatureInfo precision for transformed requests.\n- Auth-API: Fix FeatureInfo for layers with limitto.\n- Fixes subpixel transformation deviations with Pillow 3.4 or higher.\n- mapproxy-seed: Reduce log output, especially in --quiet mode.\n- mapproxy-seed: Improve tile counter for tile grids with custom resolutions.\n- mapproxy-seed: Improve saving of the seed progress for --continue.\n- Fix band-merging when not all sources return an image.\n\nOther:\n\n- Python 2.6 is no longer supported.\n\n\n1.9.1 2017-01-18\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- serve-develop: fixed reloader for Windows installations made\n  with recent pip version (#279)\n\n1.9.0 2016-07-22\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- New band merge feature. Allows to create false-color or grayscale\n  images on the fly.\n- Support for ArcGIS REST sources.\n- Support multiple tilesets for each WMTS layer with the new\n  tile_sources option.\n- Allow to build WMS images from SQLite cache with more then 330 tiles.\n- New `arcgis` cache layout. Compatible to ArcGIS exploded caches.\n- New `mp` cache layout. Reduces number of nested directories.\n- Prevent unneeded quantizing/re-encoding of images.\n- Demo client: Support custom tile_size.\n\nFixes:\n\n- Fix quantization error for some image modes\n  (e.g. grayscale image with transparency)\n- Support custom Proj4/EPSG files in mapproxy-util grid.\n- Convert paletted images to RGB(A) to avoid NEAREST resampling.\n- Fix quantizing with FASTOCTREE for paletted images with alpha channel.\n- Keep configured layer order in WMTS capabilities.\n- Fix coverage loading with Python 3.\n\nOther:\n\n- Make the output of various utils more clear.\n- wms.md.title is no longer required, default to \"MapProxy WMS\".\n\n1.8.2 2016-01-22\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- serve-develop: fixed reloader for Windows installations made\n  with recent pip version\n\n1.8.1 2015-09-22\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImprovements:\n\n- WMS 1.3.0: support for metadata required by INSPIRE View Services\n- WMS: OnlineResource defaults to service URL\n\nFixes:\n\n- mapproxy-seed: fix race-condition which prevented termination at the\n  end of the seeding process\n- autoconfig: parse capabilities without ContactInformation\n- SQLite cache: close files after seeding\n- sqlite/mbtiles: fix tile lock location\n- WMS 1.0.0: fix image format for source requests\n- WMS: allow floats for X/Y in GetFeatureInfo requests\n- CouchDB: fix for Python 3\n\nOther:\n\n- mapproxy-seed: seeding a cache with disable_storage: true returns\n  an error\n- all changes are now tested against Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5\n\n1.8.0 2015-05-18\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Support for Python 3.3 or newer\n\nImprovements:\n\n- WMS is now available at /service, /ows and /wms\n- WMTS KVP is now available at /service and /ows, RESTful service at /wmts\n- allow tiled access to layers with multiple map:false sources\n- add Access-control-allow-origin header to HTTP responses\n- list KVP and RESTful capabilities on demo page\n- disable verbose seed output if stdout is not a tty\n- add globals.cache.link_single_color_images option\n- support scale_factor for Mapnik sources\n\nFixes:\n\n- handle EPSG axis order in WMTS capabilities\n- pass through legends/featureinfo for recursive caches\n- accept PNG/JPEG style image_format for WMS 1.0.0\n- fix TMS capabilities in demo for TMS with use_grid_names\n- fix ctrl+c behaviour in mapproxy-seed\n- fix BBOX parsing in autoconf for WMS 1.3.0 services\n\nOther:\n\n- 1.8.0 is expected to work with Python 2.6, but it is no longer officially supported\n- MapProxy will now issue warnings about configurations that will change with 2.0.\n  doc/mapproxy_2.rst lists some of the planed incompatible changes\n\n1.7.1 2014-07-08\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFixes:\n\n- fix startup of mapproxy-util when libgdal/geos is missing\n\n\n\nOlder changes\n-------------\nSee https://raw.github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy/master/CHANGES.txt",
