    "description": "# metaindex\n\nmetaindex allows you to find files based on metadata information.\n\nFor example, if you want to find all pictures that are have a certain width,\nyou could do this:\n\n    metaindex find mimetype:image resolution:1200x\n\nThe following file formats are supported out of the box (although they might\nneed additional python packages, see <#Installation>):\n\n - images (png, jpg, etc.; whatever is supported by [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/))\n - audio (mp3, m4a, ogg, etc.; whatever is supported by [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/))\n - pdf\n - html\n - epub\n - [abc](https://abcnotation.com/) music notation\n - cbz (through [ComicInfo.xml](https://github.com/anansi-project/comicinfo))\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install metaindex either install it directly through pypi:\n\n    pip install metaindex\n\nOr clone the repository and install that then through pip:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/vonshednob/metaindex\n    cd metaindex\n    pip install .\n\nMost modules are optional. If you, for example, want to use metaindex for audio\nfiles and PDFs, you will have to install it like this:\n\n    pip install metaindex[pdf,audio]\n\nor, for the cloned repository:\n\n    pip install .[pdf,audio]\n\nThese modules exist for indexing:\n\n - `pdf`, for PDF files,\n - `audio`, any type of audio/music file,\n - `image`, any type of image file,\n - `video`, any type of video file (overlaps somewhat with `audio`),\n - `ebook`, ebooks and comic book formats,\n - `xdg`, support for XDG (if you use Linux, just add it),\n - `yaml`, extra metadata in YAML format,\n - `ocr`, find and extract text from images with tesseract (you must have\n   tesseract installed for this to work).\n\nIn case you just want everything, this is your install command:\n\n    pip install .[all]\n\nThere is also an experimental FuseFS filesystem. To be able to use it, you\nwill have to specify ``fuse`` as an additional module:\n\n    pip install .[all,fuse]\n\n\n## Usage\n\nBefore you can use metaindex to search for files, you have to initialize the\ncache by telling it where your files to index are, for example:\n\n    metaindex index --recursive --index ~/Pictures\n\nAfterwards you can start searching for files by metadata, like this:\n\n    metaindex find \n\n\n## Searching\n\nSearch queries for use with `metaindex find` allow you to search\n\n - for files that have a metadata tag: `metaindex find resolution?`\n - for files that have a metadata tag with a certain value: `metaindex find title:\"dude, where is my car\"`\n - for files that have any metadata tag with a certain value: `metaindex find \"just anything\"`\n\nEach value that you provide is actually a case insensitive regular expression.\n\n\n## Usage from Python\n\nTo use the metaindex infrastructure from Python, you should instantiate a\n`Cache` (you should use `MemoryCache` though to get the best performance; all\nthree classes, `Cache`, `ThreadedCache`, and `MemoryCache` provide the same\ninterface) and run queries against it (with `find`).\n\n`Cache.find` will return an iterable of `Cache.Entry` instances, consisting of\n\n - `path`, the location in the file system where that file was last seen\n - `metadata`, a multidict of all metadata\n - `last_modified`, the timestamp when the file was last modified on disk (to\n   the knowledge of the cache)\n\nTo use the user's preferences, it's a good idea to load their configuration.\nHere's an example snippet that'll do both things:\n\n    from metaindex.configuration import load\n    from metaindex.cache import MemoryCache\n\n    config = load()\n    cache = MemoryCache(config)\n\n    # memory cache can load in the background, so before the *first* query\n    # you could consider waiting for it to load all entries\n    cache.wait_for_reload()\n\n    searchquery = 'mimetype:image title?'\n\n    for entry in cache.find(searchquery):\n        print(entry.path)\n\n\n\n",
