    "description": "macholib can be used to analyze and edit Mach-O headers, the executable\nformat used by Mac OS X.\n\nIt's typically used as a dependency analysis tool, and also to rewrite dylib\nreferences in Mach-O headers to be @executable_path relative.\n\nThough this tool targets a platform specific file format, it is pure python\ncode that is platform and endian independent.\n\n\nRelease history\n===============\n\nmacholib 1.6\n------------\n\n* Add support for '@loader_path' link command in\n  macholib.dyld:\n\n  - Added function ``macholib.dyld.dyld_loader_search``\n\n  - This function is used by ``macholib.dyld.dyld_find``,\n    and that function now has an new (optional) argument\n    with the path to the loader.\n\n* Also add support for '@loader_path' to macholib.MachoGraph,\n  using the newly added '@loader_path' support in the\n  dyld module.\n\n  Due to this suppport the *macho_standalone* tool can\n  now rewrite binaries that contain an '@loader_path' load\n  command.\n\n\nmacholib 1.5.2\n--------------\n\n* Issue #93: Show the name of the affected file in the exception message\n  for Mach-O headers that are too large to relocate.\n\n\nmacholib 1.5.1\n--------------\n\n* There were no 'classifiers' in the package metadata due to\n  a bug in setup.py.\n\nmacholib 1.5\n--------------\n\nmacholib 1.5 is a minor feature release\n\n* No longer use 2to3 to provide Python 3 support\n\n  As a side-effect of this macholib no longer supports\n  Python 2.5 and earlier.\n\n* Adds suppport for some new macho load commands\n\n* Fix for py3k problem in macho_standalone.py\n\n  Patch by Guanqun Lu.\n\n* Fix for some issues in macho_dump.py\n\n  Patch by Nam Nguyen\n\n* Issue #10: Fix for LC_DATA_IN_CODE linker commands, without\n  this fix py2app cannot build application bundles when\n  the source binaries have been compiled with Xcode 4.5.\n\n* Issue #6: Fix for LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO linker commands\n\n* Use the mach header information to print the cpu type of a\n  binary, instead of trying to deduce that from pointer width\n  and endianness.\n\n  Changed the code because of issue #6, in which a user tries to\n  dump a iOS binary which results in bogus output in the previous\n  releases.\n\n* The mapping ``macholib.macho_dump.ARCH_MAP`` is undocumented\n  and no longer used by macholib itself. It will be removed\n  in the next release.\n\n\n* The command-line tools ``macho_find``, ``macho_dump`` and\n  ``macho_standalone`` are deprecated. Use \"python -mmacholib\"\n  instead. That is::\n\n   $ python -mmacholib dump /usr/bin/grep\n\n   $ python -mmacholib find ~\n\n   $ python -mmacholib standalone myapp.app\n\n  This makes it clearer which version of the tools are used.\n\nmacholib 1.4.3\n--------------\n\nmacholib 1.4.3 is a minor feature release\n\n* Added strings for 'x86_64' and 'ppc64' to\n  macholib.mach_o.CPU_TYPE_NAMES.\n\n* macho_find and macho_dump were broken in the 1.4.2 release\n\n* added 'macholib.util.NOT_SYSTEM_FILES', a list of\n  files that aren't system path's even though they are\n  located in system locations.\n\n  Needed to work around a bug in PySide (see issue #32 in the\n  py2app tracker)\n\n\n\nmacholib 1.4.2\n--------------\n\nmacholib 1.4.2 is a minor bugfix release\n\n* The support for new load commands that was added in 1.4.1\n  contained a typo that caused problems on OSX 10.7 (Lion).\n\nmacholib 1.4.1\n--------------\n\nmacholib 1.4.1 is a minor feature release\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Add support for a number of new MachO load commands that were added\n  during the lifetime of OSX 10.6: ``LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB``,\n  ``LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX``, ``LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS`` and\n  ``LC_FUNCTION_STARTS``.\n\nmacholib 1.4\n-------------\n\nmacholib 1.4 is a feature release\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Documentation is now generated using `sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx>`_\n  and can be viewed at <http://packages.python.org/macholib>.\n\n- The repository has moved to bitbucket\n\n- There now is a testsuite\n\n- Private functionality inside modules was renamed to\n  a name starting with an underscore.\n\n  .. note:: if this change affects your code you are relying on undefined\n     implementation features, please stop using private functions.\n\n- The basic packable types in ``macholib.ptypes`` were renamed to better\n  represent the corresponding C type. The table below lists the old\n  an new names (the old names are still available, but are deprecated and\n  will be removed in a future release).\n\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | **Old name** | **New name** |\n  +==============+==============+\n  | p_byte       | p_int8       |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_ubyte      | p_uint8      |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_short      | p_int16      |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_ushort     | p_uint16     |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_int        | p_int32      |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_uint       | p_uint32     |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_long       | p_int32      |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_ulong      | p_uint32     |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_longlong   | p_int64      |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n  | p_ulonglong  | p_uint64     |\n  +--------------+--------------+\n\n  ``Macholib.ptypes.p_ptr`` is no longer present as it had an unclear\n  definition and isn't actually used in the codebase.\n\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- The semantics of ``dyld.dyld_default_search`` were changed a bit,\n  it now first searches the framework path (if appropriate) and then\n  the linker path, irrespective of the value of the ``DYLD_FALLBACK*``\n  environment variables.\n\n  Previous versions would change the search order when those variables\n  was set, which is odd and doesn't correspond with the documented\n  behaviour of the system dyld.\n\n- It is once again possible to install using python2.5\n\n- The source distribution includes all files, this was broken\n  due to the switch to mercurial (which confused setuptools)\n\nmacholib 1.3\n------------\n\nmacholib 1.3 is a feature release.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Experimental Python 3.x support\n\n  This version contains lightly tested support for Python 3.\n\nmacholib 1.2.2\n--------------\n\nmacholib 1.2.2 is a bugfix release.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Macholib should work better with 64-bit code\n  (patch by Marc-Antoine Parent)",
