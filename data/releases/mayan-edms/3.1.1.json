Its main purpose is to store,\nintrospect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the\ncontextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,\nlabel, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest\nare its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/raw/master/docs/_static/overview.gif\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n\nThe easiest way to use Mayan EDMS is by using the official Docker_ image.\nMake sure Docker is properly installed and working before attempting to install\nMayan EDMS.\n\nFor the complete set of installation instructions visit the Mayan EDMS documentation\nat: http://mayan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/installation.html\n\n.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/\n\nHardware requirements\n\n- 2 Gigabytes of RAM (1 Gigabyte if OCR is turned off).\n- Multiple core CPU (64 bit, faster than 1 GHz recommended).\n\n\nImportant links\n\n- `Homepage <http://www.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJOOXHP1MJ9lVA7d8ZTlHPw>`__\n- `Documentation <http://mayan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__\n- `Paid support <http://www.mayan-edms.com/providers/>`__\n- `Roadmap <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/wikis/roadmap>`__\n- `Contributing <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__\n- `Community forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mayan-edms>`__\n- `Community forum archive <http://mayan-edms.1003.x6.nabble.com/>`__\n- `Source code, issues, bugs <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms>`__\n- `Plug-ins, other related projects <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Translations <https://www.transifex.com/rosarior/mayan-edms/>`__\n\n\n.. |pypi| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/mayan-edms\n.. |builds| image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/badges/master/build.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/pipelines\n.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gitlab/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/coverage.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gitlab/mayan-edms/mayan-edms?branch=master\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mayan-edms.svg\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mayan-edms.svg?style=flat\n.. |docker_pulls| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_stars| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_layers| image:: https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://microbadger.com/images/mayanedms/mayanedms\n\n\n3.1.1 (2018-09-18)\n==================\n* CSS tweak to make sure the AJAX spinner stays in place.\n* Fix 90, 180 and 270 degrees rotation transformations.\n\n3.1 (2018-09-17)\n================\n- Improve database vendor migration support\n- Add convertdb management command.\n- Add error checking to the crop transformation arguments.\n- Update dropzone.js' timeout from 30 seconds to 120 to allow upload\n  of large files on slow connections.\n- Increase gunicorn's timeout from 30 seconds to 120.\n- Update packages versions: Pillow:5.2.0, PyYAML:3.13, django-environ:0.4.5,\n  django-model-utils:3.1.2, django-mptt:0.9.1, django-widget-tweaks: 1.4.2,\n  flanker:0.9.0, flex:6.13.2, furl:1.2, gevent:1.3.5, graphviz: 0.8.4,\n  gunicorn:19.9.0, pyocr:0.5.2, python-dateutil:2.7.3\n- Remove use of django-compressor and cssmin now that the project used\n  Whitenoise.\n- Display error when attempting to recalculate the page count of an empty\n  document (document stub that has no document version).\n- Add support for client side caching of document page images.
