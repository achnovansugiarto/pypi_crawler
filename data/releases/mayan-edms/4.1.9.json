Its main purpose is to store,\nintrospect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the\ncontextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,\nlabel, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest\nare its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/raw/master/docs/_static/overview.gif\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n\nThe easiest way to use Mayan EDMS is by using the official Docker_ image.\nMake sure Docker is properly installed and working before attempting to install\nMayan EDMS.\n\nFor the complete set of installation instructions visit the Mayan EDMS documentation\nat: https://docs.mayan-edms.com/parts/installation.html\n\n.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/\n\nThe final version of the book \"Exploring Mayan EDMS\" available now!\n\n.. image:: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/89d2fe787507c9247aa7bb406e2682b53eb7a5f9/68747470733a2f2f64313273776274773731397934732e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f696d616765732f76365270785734302f615030714b4c6a6b50694175585a6859754234352f774441554c417a4679782e6a7065673f773d353438\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n    :target: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nClick the image or visit: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nHardware requirements\n\n- 2 Gigabytes of RAM (1 Gigabyte if OCR is turned off).\n- Multiple core CPU (64 bit, faster than 1 GHz recommended).\n\n\nImportant links\n\n- `Homepage <http://www.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Documentation <https://docs.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Contributing <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__\n- `Forum <https://forum.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Source code, issues, bugs <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms>`__\n- `Plug-ins, other related projects <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Translations <https://www.transifex.com/rosarior/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJOOXHP1MJ9lVA7d8ZTlHPw>`__\n\n\n.. |donation| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/donation-PayPal-brightgreen\n   :target: https://paypal.me/MayanEDMS\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/mayan-edms/\n.. |builds| image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/badges/master/build.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/pipelines\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mayan-edms.svg\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mayan-edms.svg?style=flat\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/LICENSE\n.. |docker_pulls| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_stars| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_layers| image:: https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://microbadger.com/images/mayanedms/mayanedms\n.. |commit_activity| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/mayan-edms/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/\n.. |support| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_support-brightgreen\n   :target: https://www.mayan-edms.com/support/\n.. |store| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Online_store-black\n   :target: https://teespring.com/stores/mayan-edms\n\n\n4.1.9 (2022-04-24)\n==================\n- Remove hardcoded search model variable name from ``search_box.html``\n  template.\n\n4.1.8 (2022-04-23)\n==================\n- Fix the search model API URL reference. Closes GitLab issue #1098. Thanks\n  to Bastian (@Basti-Fantasti) for the report.\n- Use the ``SEARCH_MODEL_NAME_KWARG`` instead of hard coding the search model\n  API URL reference.\n- Merged changes from version 4.0.22:\n\n  - Remove usage of flat values list in document checkout manager.\n  - Remove usage of flat ``values_list`` queryset in metadata managers module.\n  - Cleanup markup of the confirmation form.\n  - Remove redundant modal close button.\n  - Fix search proxies method decorator.\n  - Reorganize converter office MIME type list.\n  - Improve metadata validation error message.\n  - Don't display API URL links to indexing instance and template parents that\n    are also root nodes as these are not accessible.\n  - Remove repeated partition file close call.\n  - Update Django version 2.2.24 to 2.2.28.\n\n- Reduce the Sentry client default ``traces_sample_rate`` from 0.25 to 0.05.\n- Add keyword argument to ``self.stderr`` and ``self.stdout`` usage.\n- In ``FilteredRelatedFieldMixin``, split retrieval of the queryset to\n  avoid the exception handler from capturing an ``AttributeError`` that it\n  shouldn't.\n- Updated the ``subject`` and ``body`` fields of the document email\n  workflow action to be optional.\n- Migrate old workflow ``EmailAction`` instances instead of sub-classing\n  for backwards compatibility. Improves commit\n  ``b522dac80f7f6cfb8c5db8a74d6d2d22bc8b281a`` and avoids a double entry in\n  the workflow state action selection dropbox.\n- Partials navigation updates:\n\n  - Streamline JavaScript partials navigation code.\n  - Make the AJAX response redirect code configurable. New setting\n    ``APPEARANCE_AJAX_REDIRECTION_CODE`` added.\n  - Remove repeated AJAX redirection middleware.\n\n- Add keyword arguments to zip file calls.\n- ``PartialNavigation.js`` improvements.\n\n  - Clean URL query on form submit and use form data as the URL query.\n  - Remove dead code.\n  - Use constants where appropriate.\n\n- Backport new document link condition logic. Ensure new document and file\n  links access works like their respective views. The links will be active\n  when the access is granted for the source as well as the document/document\n  type. Closes GitLab issue #1102. Thanks to Julian Marié (@Angelfs) for the\n  report and debug information.\n- Improve logic of the new document file link\n\n  - Access the view user in a more reliable way.\n  - Test the new file permission of the document and not\n    of the document type.\n  - If no document is present in the view exit fast.\n  - Update tests.\n\n4.1.7 (2022-04-01)\n==================\n- Backport fixes from version 4.2.3\n\n  - Add restart policy to the Traefik container definition.\n  - Remove duplicated ``Document.get_label`` method.\n  - Fix an issue where a staging folder would not tag uploaded\n    documents.\n  - Fix document file signature serializer label.\n  - Update document metadata model field label from \"Metadata type value\"\n    to \"Metadata value\".\n  - Filter unread message count badge by message read permission.\n  - Update signature view permission label from\n    \"View details of document signatures\" to \"View document signature\".\n  - Ensure the object copy permission is required for the object copy link.\n  - Fix ``GUNICORN_REQUESTS_JITTER`` documentation setting name reference.\n\n4.1.6 (2022-02-15)\n==================\n- Append the text \"signed\" to the label of a signed document file instead\n  of using the temporary filename used during signing.\n- Ensure the signed document file is used when the file downloaded is\n  requested and when calculating the signed document file checksum.\n  Solves issue in forum post 6149. Thanks to forum user @qra for the report\n  and debug information.\n- Update IMAP source ``store commands`` to be optional.\n- Update email sources ``SSL`` checkbox to be optional.\n- Undo POP3 source context manager changes from commit\n  c19040491e20c9a783ae6191613bc8c5f7acb038. It seems Python's email libraries\n  do not have feature parity. ``imaplib`` was updated to support context\n  managers but ``poplib`` was not.\n- Update requirements to specify Python version 3.5 to 3.9.\n- Update Django version 2.2.24 to 2.2.27.\n\n4.1.5 (2022-02-03)\n==================\n- Fix CAA document links. Closes GitLab issue #1068. Thanks to\n  Matthias Löblich (@startmat) for the report.\n- Remove superfluous apostrophe character in sort heading markup.\n- Fix email sources processing a single message but performing cleanup on\n  multiple messages.

Thanks to Will Wright (@fireatwill)\n  for the report and the patch.\n- Add libjpeg and libpng to the dev setup target.\n- Fix editing OCR content via the API.\n- Fix the ``AdvancedSearchViewTestCaseMixin`` class. It had\n  ``GenericViewTestCase`` as a base class when it is supposed to be a mixin\n  and not have any.\n- Add ``AutoHelpTextLabelFieldMixin``. This mixin tries to extract the\n  label and help text from the model field when the serializer field does\n  not specify any.\n- Add filtering to the ``parent`` field of the index template node\n  serializers. Restrict options to the current index template and allows\n  removing the now redundant validation.\n- Add ``index_template_root_node_id`` field to the index template\n  serializer. Closes GitLab issue #1061. Thanks to\n  Ludovic Anterieur(@lanterieur) for the report and initial implementation.\n- Fix responsive menu close button triggering home navigation.

Closes GitLab issue #1065. Thanks to\n  Will Wright (@fireatwill) for the report and debug information.\n- Rename ``ErrorLog`` model to ``StoredErrorLog``. This change follow the\n  normal paradigm when a service is provided by a model and a runtime class.\n- Make the ``StoredErrorLog`` name field unique to ensure ``get_or_create``\n  works in an atomic way.\n- Create the error log partition when the model instance is created.\n- Normalize the error log partition name format using a static method.\n- Delete the error log partition on model instance deletion and not just the\n  error log partition entries.\n- Ensure a memory database is used when running the tests.\n\n4.1.3 (2021-11-02)\n==================\n- Vagrant updates\n\n  - Load installation value from ``config.env`` file.\n  - Update supervisord during installation.\n  - Setup the APT proxy during installation.\n  - Change how APT and PIP proxies are defined to match the Docker build\n    target.\n  - Add makefile for vagrant.\n  - Move devpi targets to the main makefile.\n\n- Sentry client backend updates:\n\n  - Add more SDK options.\n  - Add typecasting to options.\n  - Add debug logging.\n  - Add Celery integration.\n  - Add Redis Integration.\n  - Lower the default value of ``traces_sample_rate`` from 1 to 0.25.\n    This value is better suited for production deployments. Increase to 1\n    for full debug information capture during development or testing.\n\n- File staging sources updates:\n\n  - Use ``StreamingHttpResponse`` to serve previews.\n  - Support previews for office document files.\n  - Fix extra brackets in the encoded and cached filenames.\n  - Simplify image generation.\n  - Use context manager to ensure preview images are always closed.\n\n- Sources app updates:\n\n  - Don't assume all source backends provide an upload form.\n  - Improve SANE scanner error handling.\n  - Fix logging of non interactive source errors.\n  - Show interactive source processing as a message.\n\n- Fix the copying of the bootstrap alert style.\n- Optimize the copying of the boostrap alert style by executing it only\n  in the root template. This runs the code just once instead of running it\n  on each page refresh. The element ``#div-javascript-dynamic-content`` was\n  also remove and it is now created and destroyed dynamically once just.\n- Ensure that the ``resolved_object`` is injected into the context before\n  passing the context to the link's ``check_condition`` method. Suspected\n  cause of the GitLab issue #1052 and #1049. Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur\n  (@lanterieur) and Johannes Bornhold (@joh5) for the reports and debug\n  information.\n- Converter updates:\n\n  - Fix duplicate asset display. Closes GitLab issue #1053. Thanks to\n    Ryan Showalter (@ryanshow) for the report.\n  - Split the transformation ``cache_hash`` method to allow subclasses to\n    modify how the cache hash is calculated.\n  - Include the asset image hash into the asset transformation hash\n    calculation. This change invalidates all cached page images that\n    use an asset if the asset image is modified.\n  - Improve the way the absolute coordinates of the percentage asset paste\n    transformation are calculated.\n\n- Use redirection instead of the ``output_file`` argument to allow the SANE\n  scanner source to work with more SANE scanner versions.\n\n4.1.2 (2021-10-27)\n==================\n- Don't insert the value ``ORGANIZATIONS_URL_BASE_PATH`` in the path\n  then it is ``None``.\n- Fix ``ModelTemplateField`` not displaying the ``initial_help_text``\n  for the specific usage instance. The ``initial_help_text`` was\n  being removed from the ``kwargs`` in the ``ModelTemplateField``\n  as well as the super class.\n- Workflows improvements.\n\n  - Use the templating widget for the workflow document properties\n    modification and the HTTP request actions.\n  - Consolidate the workflow action help text.\n\n- Fix issue when attempting to create a Document version page OCR update\n  workflow action. Instead of the model class, the template form field now\n  passes the ``app_label`` and the ``model_name`` of the model via the\n  widget attributes to avoid Django's attribute template to attempt\n  getting a string representation of the model.\n\n4.1.1 (2021-10-26)\n==================\n- Move Docker Compose variables to the correct file. Move\n  ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` and ``COMPOSE_PROFILES`` to the\n  .env file.\n- Fix asset image generation. Closes GitLab issue #1047 for series 4.1.\n  Thanks to Ryan Showalter (@ryanshow) for the report and debug information.\n- Improve sidebar menu heading display logic.\n- Fix leftover HTML markup in the server error dialog window.\n- Remove redundant close button for the server error dialog window.\n- Merged fixes and improvements from versions 4.0.17 and 4.0.18.\n- Update PIP from version 21.2.4 to 21.3.1.\n- Remove MySQL upgrade CD/CI testing pipeline stage until support is properly\n  re-implemented for version 8.0.\n- Add CD/CI triggers for local testing.\n- Exclude all migration tests by tagging automatically at the\n  ``MayanMigratorTestCase`` subclass definition.\n- Support multiple environments per dependency.\n- Update the ``wheel`` library to be a dependency of the ``build`` and the\n  ``documentation`` environments to workaround a bug in PIP that causes\n  ``\"error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'\"``.\n\n4.1 (2021-10-10)\n================\n- Add support for editing the document version page OCR content.\n  Closes GitLab issue #592. Thanks for Martin (@efelon) for the\n  request.\n- Refactor sources app.\n\n  - Add object permission support to source views.\n  - Remove locking support from staging folder uploads.\n  - Update staging preview to use new preview generation\n    code.\n  - Use streaming response to serve staging folder images.\n  - Convert the sources from models into backend classes.\n    The sources are now decoupled from the app. Each source\n    backend can defined its own callbacks and use an unified\n    background task.\n  - Perform code reduction. Remove PseudoFile and SourceUploaded\n    classes. Each source backend is now responsible for providing\n    a list of shared uploaded files.\n\n- Multiform improvements:\n\n  - Support multi form extra kwargs.\n  - Move the dynamic part of the multi form method to the end\n    of the name.\n  - Add a white horizontal ruler to separate the form\n    instances.\n\n- Consolidate the image generation task:\n\n  - Remove document file, version, converter asset, and workflow template\n    preview image generation.\n  - Remove converter literal `TASK_ASSET_IMAGE_GENERATE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove workflow literals `TASK_GENERATE_WORKFLOW_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove `document_states_fast` queue.\n  - Remove documents literals\n    `DEFAULT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY` and\n    `DEFAULT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove settings\n    `DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY` and\n    `DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n\n- Search updates\n\n  - Remove `TASK_RETRY_DELAY` and use `retry_backoff`.\n  - Add the tag color as a search field\n  - Improve and simplify query cleaning up by doing so after the\n    scopes are decoded.\n  - Fix Whoosh reindexing after m2m fields perform a remove.\n  - Fix Whoosh search for related m2m fields with multiple\n    values.\n  - Improve tests for edge cases.\n  - Fix document version API tests module.\n  - Variables renamed for clarity and to specify their purpose.\n  - Process the 'q' parameter at the class and not in the\n    backend.\n  - Ignore invalid query fields.\n  - Index for search on m2m signal.\n  - Return empty results on an empty query.\n  - Produce an empty scope 0 on an empty query.\n  - Improve tests.\n  - Add UUID field for all document child objects.\n\n- Add detail view for groups.\n- Show total permission when running the `purgepermissions` command.\n- Add detail for file partitions.\n- Add placeholder absolute links for announcements, workflow templates, quotas.\n- Add detail view for stored permissions.\n- Rename role setup views.\n- Load user management first to allow patching\n- Register ACL events when enabling ACLs. Objects that are registered to\n  support ACLs will also be registered for ACL events to allow subscribing to\n  ACL changes of the object.\n- Allow bind either the events links, the subscription link, both or none.\n- Improve workflow app navigation.\n- Improve sidebar navigation.\n- Improve clarity of the action dropdown sections.\n- Make the index instance node value field an unique field among its own tree\n  level.

Avoid doing direct imports when\n    there circular dependencies.\n  - Move the events app to the top of the installed apps to allow it to\n    preload all events.\n  - Only show the event clear and export links for object whose events\n    that can be cleared and exported.\n\n- ACLs apps updates:\n\n  - The ACL edited event is now triggered only once when all permissions are\n    changed.\n  - The action object of the ACL edited event is now the content object and\n    not the permission.\n\n- Enable event subscriptions for workflow states, workflow state actions,\n  and workflow transitions.\n- Support deleting multiple roles in a single action.\n- OCR app updates:\n\n  - Use ``MultipleObjectDeleteView`` for the delete view.\n  - Rename single and multiple delete view names.\n  - Improve tests.\n\n- Document comments app API updates:\n\n  - Modernize code to use latest internal interfaces.\n  - Exclude trashed documents.\n  - Reduce serializers.\n  - Return error 404 on insufficient access.\n\n- Document indexing API updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents.\n  - Split tests.\n  - Add event checking to remaining tests.\n\n- Events app API updates:\n\n  - Return error 404 on insufficient permissions.\n  - Modernize `APIObjectEventListView` to use latest interfaces\n    and mixins.\n\n- Document parsing app updates:\n\n  - Update API to latest internal interfaces.\n  - Add testing for multiple document file content delete views.\n  - Speed up tests.\n  - Add event checking to tests.\n  - Use `MultipleObjectDeleteView` for the file content delete view.\n  - Improve text string of the `DocumentFileContentDeleteView` view.\n\n- Document signatures app updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from the API.\n  - Add event checking to tests.\n  - Track user when uploading signature files.\n\n- Workflows app updates:\n\n  - Split API views.\n  - Add trashed document test.\n  - Code style updates.\n\n- Smart link app refactor:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from API.\n  - Improve existing tests.\n  - Add additional tests.\n  - Rebuild the resolved smart link API and serializer.\n  - Add a new permission to view resolved smart links. This permission needs\n    to be granted for the smart link and for the document/document type.\n  - Update API to return error 404 on insufficient access.\n  - Remove unused test mixins.\n  - Split view and API test modules.\n\n- Documents app updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from all API views.\n  - New `valid` model managers for recently accessed, recently created, and\n    favorite documents. These managers exclude trashed documents at the model\n    level. The 'objects' manager for these model returns the unfiltered\n    queryset.\n  - Trashed document delete API now returns a 202 code instead of 204. The\n    delete method now runs in the background in the same way as the trashed\n    document delete view works in the UI. The return code was updated to\n    reflect this internal change.\n  - Track the user for the trashed document delete, restore and for the\n    trash can empty methods.\n  - Add event checking for some remaining tests.\n  - Add additional tests.\n\n- Add ``BackendDynamicForm``, a dynamic form for interacting with backends.\n- Add a reusable backend class named ``mayan.apps.databases.classes.BaseBackend``.\n\n- Refactor mailer app:\n\n  - Allow sending document files and document versions as attachments.\n  - Update the ``UserMailer`` model to work with the ``BackendModelMixin``\n    mixin. This allows removing all backend managing code from the model.\n  - Generate the dynamic form schema in the base backend class. Removes\n    dynamic form schema from the views.\n  - Use ``BackendDynamicForm`` and remove dynamic form code from the forms\n    module.\n  - Generalize document file and document version to support any type of\n    object.\n  - Update workflow action to send links to documents or attach the active\n    versions.\n  - Use the reusable ``BaseBackend`` class and remove explicit backend\n    scaffolding.\n\n- Improve test open file and descriptor leak detection.\n- Close storage model file after inspection as Django creates a new\n  file descriptor on inspection.\n- Ensure the name and not the path is used. Compressed files can include\n  path references, these are now scrubbed and only the filename of the file\n  in the compressed archive is used.\n- File handling was improved. Context managers are now used for temporary\n  files and directories. This ensure file descriptors are closed and freed up\n  in all scenarios.\n- Add detached signature deleted event.\n- Document signature app general improvements. Renamed links, icons and\n  view for clarity. Split tests modules.\n- Metadata API updates:\n\n  - Unify document type metadata type serializers.\n  - Update the permission layout to match the one of the views.\n    The edit or view permission is now required for the document\n    type as well as the metadata type.\n\n- Add ``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` to control how many times\n  the image regeration task will retry lock errors.\n- Add support for appending all document file pages as a single document\n  version.\n- Moved signals, hooks and events outside of the document file creation\n  transaction.\n- Capture the user for the document version page reset and remap action\n  events.\n- Add conditions to the favorite document links.\n- Update mailing icons.\n- Remove submit button label and submit button icons.\n- The ``performupgrade`` command won't try to hide critical errors and\n  instead raise any exception to obtain the maximum amount of debug\n  information.\n- Add support to filter the add/remove choice form.\n- Dependencies app updates:\n\n  - Move the link to check for the latest version to the tools\n    menu.\n  - Checking for updates now required the view dependencies\n    permission.\n\n- Unify request resolution for navigation classes.\n- Support retrieving a list of ``SourceColumn`` by name.\n- Dashboard app updates:\n\n  - Extend dashboard widget interfaces.\n  - Add list dashboard widget.\n  - Move dashboard CSS from the appearance app to the dashboards app.\n  - Add dashboard list and detail views.\n  - Add setting to select the default dashboard.\n  - Add template tag to display the default dashboard in the home\n    view.\n\n- Refactor ``SourceColumn.get_for_source``.\n- Add ``RecentlyAccessedDocumentProxy`` to allow adding a column with the\n  creation date time.\n- Navigation refactor:\n\n  - Rewritten link to source matching code.\n  - Rewritten menu resolution.\n  - Pass the ``resolved_object`` to link conditions.\n\n- Don't trigger the settings change flag on user language changes.\n- Add settings to allow changing the default and the maximums\n  REST API page size.\n- Add support for service client backends to the platform app.\n- Add Sentry.io service client backend.\n- Support overriding form buttons.\n- Improve metadata type form tab order. Disables metadata type name field\n  to skip them during tabbing.\n- Support step rewinding for the sources wizard.\n- Add support for recoding email Message ID. The email source can now record\n  an email Message ID from the header as it is processed into a documents.\n  All documents created from the same email will have the same Message ID.\n  Thanks to forum user qra (@qra) for the request.\n\n- Improve `BaseBackend` class\n\n  - Add deterministic parent base backend class detection.\n  - Register backend class only to their respective parent base\n    backend classes.\n\n- Render main menu icons properly. The change in\n  bbbb92edb85f192987fdfb4efc574bd79221b6ed removed literal CSS icon\n  support. A single reference to the old CSS icon render was left behind\n  which cause the icon object Python memory location to be rendered\n  inline with the menu HTML. This cause the same menu to have different\n  hashes when rendered by the different Gunicorn workers. Solved GitLab\n  issue #1038. Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for the report.\n- Add setting to change the menu polling interval. Values specified in\n  milliseconds. Use `None` to disable.\n- Enforce ``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` setting and add logging\n  message when the maximum retires are exhausted.\n- Messaging app updates:\n\n  - Add API views.\n  - Exclude superusers and staff users from being message recipients.\n  - Add dedicated create message form.\n  - Use Select2 for the user selection field.\n  - Add message edit permission. This permission is required in order to\n    change the message read status.\n\n- Add ``get_absolute_api_url`` method to download files, document versions\n  and users. These URL are used to determine the message sender's API URL.\n- Test view mixin updates:\n\n  - Add a default ordering to the ``TestModel`` to silence warning.\n  - Fix ``TestModel.save()`` method.\n  - Support multiple test views per test case.\n  - Allow subclasses to supply their own ``urlpatterns``.\n  - Support passing arguments to ``add_test_view``.\n\n- Add batch API request support.\n- Adjust event registrations:\n\n  - Register cabinet document add and remove events to the Document model too.\n  - Register document file parsing events to the Document model too.\n  - Rename label of the document parsed content deleted event.\n  - Replace the ``DownloadFile`` content object registration from the\n    ``Document`` model to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n  - Register the document file created, edited events to the ``Document``\n    model too.\n  - Register the document version created, edited events to the ``Document``\n    model too.\n  - Register the document trashed event to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Remove the document file created event from the ``DocumentFile`` model.\n  - Remove the document version created event from the ``DocumentVersion``\n    model.\n  - Register the document version page deleted event to the\n    ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n  - Remove the document version page deleted event from the\n    ``DocumentVersionPage`` model.\n  - Register the tag attached, removed events to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Register the web link navigated event to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Remove the document version page OCR edited event from the ``Document``\n    model.\n  - Register the document version OCR submitted, finished, content deleted\n    events to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n\n- Sort object and list facet links when using the list item view.\n- Rename environment variable ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_JITTER`` to\n  ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_REQUESTS_JITTER``.\n- Support changing the operating system user when creating the supervisord\n  file using the environment variable ``MAYAN_OS_USERNAME``.\n- Reorder the Gunicorn arguments.\n- Make the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable an alias of\n  ``MAYAN_SETTINGS_MODULE`` in the supervisord file.\n- Add ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY`` to the gunicorn invocation in\n  the ``run_frontend.sh`` batch file.\n- Frontend updates:\n\n  - Ensure list groups use <ul> and <li> instead of plain <div>.\n  - Move ``mayan_image.js`` to the converter app.\n  - Update ``afterBaseLoad`` to work by defining a list of callbacks. This\n    allows defining callbacks from different apps.\n  - Set JavaScript callbacks and setup method to run in async mode.\n  - Move static inline app CSS to individual CSS files.\n- Fix workflow template API description text. Closes GitLab issue #1042.\n  Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for the report.\n- Add document template state action API endpoints.

Load the page object only once\n  per request.\n- Unify the supervisord templates. The direct deployment and the Docker image\n  now use the same supervisord template.\n- Email the active document version.

Closes GitLab issue #929. Thanks to Francesco\n  Musella (@francesco.musella-biztems) for the report.\n- Reorganize mixins. Add a suffix to specify the purpose of the mixin and\n  move them to different module when appropriate.\n- Refactored the notification generation for efficiency, scalability and\n  simplicity. Only users subscribed to events are queued for notifications.\n  Content types of event targets and action objects is reused from the action\n  model instead of gathering from inspection. Nested loop removed and lowered\n  to a single loop.\n- Optimize SourceColumn resolution. Support column exclusion for all object\n  types. Ensure columns are not repeated when resolved even if they were\n  defined multiple times. Improve docstring for the resolution logic in each\n  level. Remove unused ``context`` parameter. Add SourceColumn tests.\n- Support defining the default ``SearchModel``. This allows removing the hard\n  coded search model name from the search template and allows third party\n  apps to define their own default ``SearchModel``.\n- Update MySQL Docker image from version 5.7 to 8.0. PostreSQL image from version\n  10.14 to 10.15. Redis image from version 5.0 to 6.0.\n- Move time delays from test and into its own test mixin. Remove MySQL test delays.\n- Standardize a class for the widgets of the class ``SourceColumn`` named\n  ``SourceColumnWidget``.\n- The cabinet view permission is now required for a document, to be able to\n  view which cabinets contain that document. This change mirrors the\n  permission layout of the metadata and tag apps.\n- File caching now uses the same lock for all file methods. This ensures that\n  a cache file that is being deleted or purge is not open for reading and\n  vice versa.\n- A method decorator was added to the lock manager app to ease usage of the\n  same lock workflow in methods of the same class.\n- The error handling of the ``CachePartitionFile`` methods was improved.\n  This ensures proper clean up of stray storage files on model file creation\n  error. The model now avoids accessing the model file for clean up on model\n  file creation error, which would raise a hard to understand and diagnose\n  missing file entry error. The model now avoids updating cache size on\n  either model or storage file creation error.\n- Support disabling form help texts via ``form_hide_help_text``.\n- Docker image tagging layout has been updated. Images are tagged by version\n  and series. Series have the 's' prefix and versions have the 'v' prefix.\n- Added API endpoints for the Assets model.\n- Added cached image generation for assets.\n- Added asset detail view with image preview.\n- Added a detail view for the cache model.\n- Added the ``image_url`` field to the Workflow template serializer.\n- Added retry support for the workflow preview generation task.\n- Updated the autoadmin app to use the login template ``login_content``\n  template hook. This allows the autoadmin app to show login information\n  without directly modifying the login template.\n- Update tags app to improve user event tracking on view and API.\n- Support deleting multiple document files.\n- Track document file deletion event user in views.\n- Rename ``setting_workflowimagecache_storage`` to\n  ``setting_workflow_image_cache_storage_backend``.\n- Support collapsing the options of the menus \"list facet\" and \"object\" when\n  in list view mode. This behavior is controlled with the new settings:\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_LIST_FACET`` and\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_OBJECT``. Both default to ``False``.\n- Added a check to the task manager app to ensure all defined tasks are\n  properly configure in their respective ``queues.py`` modules.\n- ACL apps updates: Add ACL deleted event, track action actor in API and\n  views. Simply API views using REST API mixins. Update API views to return\n  404 errors instead of 403, move global ACL list to the setup menu,\n  model that are registered for ACLs are now also automatically register\n  events in order to receive the ACL deleted event, improve tests and add more\n  test cases.\n- Update AddRemoveView to only call the underlying add or remove methods only\n  if there are objects to act upon instead of calling the method with an\n  empty queryset which would trigger unwanted events.\n- Add ``ExternalContentTypeObjectAPIViewMixin`` to the REST API app. This\n  mixin simplifies working with models that act upon another object via\n  their Content Type, such as the ACLs.\n- Update the ACL app to support multiple foreign object permission\n  inheritance. Support for ``GenericForeignKey`` non default ``ct_field``,\n  and ``fk_field`` was also added.\n- Added support to export the global events list, object events list and\n  user events list.\n- Registering a model to receive events will cause it to have the object\n  event view and object event subscription links bound too. This can\n  be disabled with the `bind_links` argument. The default menu to bind the\n  links is the \"List facet\". This can be changed via the ``menu`` argument.\n- Change the format of the ``file_metadata_value_of`` helper. The driver\n  and metadata entry are now separated by a double underscore instead of a\n  single underscore. This allows supporting drivers and entries that might\n  contain an underscore themselves.\n- Add ``databases`` app to group data and models related code.\n- Add class support for scoped searches. GitLab issue #875.\n- Add sorting support to the API.\n- Updated how the user interface column sorting works. The code was\n  simplified by using a single query variable. The code was expanded\n  to support multiple fields in the future. The URL query key used for\n  column sorting was changed to match the API sorting.a\n- Added the ``databases`` app. This app groups data and models related code.\n- Added a patch for Django's ``Migration`` class to display time delta for\n  each migration during development.\n- Docker Compose updates:\n\n    - Use profiles for extra containers.\n    - Converted to use extensions to remove duplicated markup.\n    - A new container was added to mount an index.\n    - Added support for Traefik.\n    - Added sample .env file.\n    - Update required Docker Compose to version 1.28.\n\n- Add a third document filename generator that used an UUID plus the original\n  filename of the uploaded file. This generator has the advantage of producing\n  unique filename while also preserving the original filename for reference.\n- Add support for the \"Reply To\" field for sending documents via email and\n  for the mailing workflow actions. Closes GitLab issue #864. Thanks to\n  Kevin Pawsey (@kevinpawsey) for the request.\n- Allow customization of the error condition when generating document images.\n  This allows displaying more icons in addition to the generic document\n  image error with additional contextual information and popup messages\n  explaining the actual error condition.\n- Add key attributes to the document signature serializers. Forum topic 5085.\n  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.\n- Added key attributes to the document signature model as calculated\n  properties.\n- Move detached signature upload from the created endpoint to a\n  new /uploaded endpoint.\n- Added document signature events.\n- Refactored the workflows app.\n\n    - Rebalance permissions needed to transition a workflow instance.\n      The workflow instance transition permission is now needed for\n      the document and for either the transition or the workflow.\n    - Add more tests including trashed document tests.\n    - Split API tests into instance and template tests.\n    - Add `workflow-instance-log-entry-detail` end point.\n    - Add parent URL fields to serializers.\n    - Allow passing extra data when transitioning a workflow via the API.\n    - Limit state options to workflow when using the API. This matches\n      the UI behavior.\n\n- Renamed the AddRemove view ``main_object_method_add`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_name`` and ``main_object_method_remove`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_remove_name``.\n- Add ``has_translations`` flag to MayanAppConfig to indicate if the app\n  should have its translation files processed or ignored. Defaults to\n  ``True``.\n- Dependency version upgrades:\n\n  - coverage from 5.1 to 5.5.\n  - Django to 2.2.23.\n  - django-debug-toolbar to 3.2.\n  - django-extensions to 3.1.2.\n  - django-rosetta to 0.9.4.\n  - django-silk to 4.1.0.\n  - flake8 to 3.9.0.\n  - ipython to 7.22.0.\n  - pycounty to 20.7.3.\n  - requests to 2.25.1.\n  - Sphinx to 3.5.4.\n  - sh to 1.14.1.\n  - sphinx-autobuild to 2021.3.14.\n  - sphinx-sitemap to 2.2.0.\n  - sphinxcontrib-spelling to 7.1.0.\n  - tornado to 6.1.\n  - tox from 3.14.6 to 3.23.1.\n  - transifex-client to 0.14.2.\n  - twine to 3.4.1.\n  - wheel to 0.36.2.\n\n- Fix sub workflow launch state action.\n- Convert the workflow instance creation to a background task.\n- File caching app updates\n\n  - Add cache partition purge event.\n  - Use new event decorator.\n  - Use related object as the cache partition purge event action object.\n  - Allow cache prune to retry on LockError.\n  - Add maximum cache prune failure counter.\n  - Remove possible cache file lock name collision.\n\n- Add locking to the duplicated document scan code to workaround race\n  condition in Django bug #19544 when adding duplicated documents via\n  the many to many field ``.add()`` method.\n- Remove the default queue. All tasks must now be explicitly assigned to an\n  app defined queue.\n- Update file cache to use and LRU style eviction logic.\n- Only prune caches during startup if their maximum size changed.\n- Add detection of excessive cache pruning when cache size is too small for\n  the workload.\n- Detect and avoid duplicated queue names.\n- Add a fourth class of worker.\n- Re-balance queues.\n- Rename workers from ``fast``, ``medium``, and ``slow`` to ``A`` (fast),\n  ``B`` (new workers), ``C`` (medium), ``D`` (slow).\n- Add support for passing custom nice level to the workers when using the\n  Docker image ``run_worker`` command.
