Its main purpose is to store,\nintrospect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the\ncontextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,\nlabel, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest\nare its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/raw/master/docs/_static/overview.gif\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n\nThe easiest way to use Mayan EDMS is by using the official Docker_ image.\nMake sure Docker is properly installed and working before attempting to install\nMayan EDMS.\n\nFor the complete set of installation instructions visit the Mayan EDMS documentation\nat: https://docs.mayan-edms.com/parts/installation.html\n\n.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/\n\nThe final version of the book \"Exploring Mayan EDMS\" available now!\n\n.. image:: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/89d2fe787507c9247aa7bb406e2682b53eb7a5f9/68747470733a2f2f64313273776274773731397934732e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f696d616765732f76365270785734302f615030714b4c6a6b50694175585a6859754234352f774441554c417a4679782e6a7065673f773d353438\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n    :target: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nClick the image or visit: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nHardware requirements\n\n- 2 Gigabytes of RAM (1 Gigabyte if OCR is turned off).\n- Multiple core CPU (64 bit, faster than 1 GHz recommended).\n\n\nImportant links\n\n- `Homepage <http://www.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Documentation <https://docs.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Contributing <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__\n- `Forum <https://forum.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Source code, issues, bugs <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms>`__\n- `Plug-ins, other related projects <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Translations <https://www.transifex.com/rosarior/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJOOXHP1MJ9lVA7d8ZTlHPw>`__\n\n\n.. |donation| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/donation-PayPal-brightgreen\n   :target: https://paypal.me/MayanEDMS\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/mayan-edms/\n.. |builds| image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/badges/master/build.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/pipelines\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mayan-edms.svg\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mayan-edms.svg?style=flat\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/LICENSE\n.. |docker_pulls| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_stars| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg?maxAge=3600\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_layers| image:: https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://microbadger.com/images/mayanedms/mayanedms\n.. |commit_activity| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/mayan-edms/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/\n.. |support| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_support-brightgreen\n   :target: https://www.mayan-edms.com/support/\n.. |store| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Online_store-black\n   :target: https://teespring.com/stores/mayan-edms\n\n\n4.0.14 (2021-08-05)\n===================\n- Fix a regression in the document version page image cache maximum size\n  setting callback.\n- Fix converter layer priority exclusion for layers with a priority of 0.\n  This fixes the preview layer priority when editing the redactions of pages\n  that also contain transformations in other layers.\n\n4.0.13 (2021-08-02)\n===================\n- Checkout test updates.\n\n  - Silence debug output of tests.\n  - Speed up tests using document stubs.\n\n- Improve organization URL and host settings.

Closes GitLab issue #929. Thanks to Francesco\n  Musella (@francesco.musella-biztems) for the report.\n- Reorganize mixins. Add a suffix to specify the purpose of the mixin and\n  move them to different module when appropriate.\n- Refactored the notification generation for efficiency, scalability and\n  simplicity. Only users subscribed to events are queued for notifications.\n  Content types of event targets and action objects is reused from the action\n  model instead of gathering from inspection. Nested loop removed and lowered\n  to a single loop.\n- Optimize SourceColumn resolution. Support column exclusion for all object\n  types. Ensure columns are not repeated when resolved even if they were\n  defined multiple times. Improve docstring for the resolution logic in each\n  level. Remove unused ``context`` parameter. Add SourceColumn tests.\n- Support defining the default ``SearchModel``. This allows removing the hard\n  coded search model name from the search template and allows third party\n  apps to define their own default ``SearchModel``.\n- Update MySQL Docker image from version 5.7 to 8.0. PostreSQL image from version\n  10.14 to 10.15. Redis image from version 5.0 to 6.0.\n- Move time delays from test and into its own test mixin. Remove MySQL test delays.\n- Standardize a class for the widgets of the class ``SourceColumn`` named\n  ``SourceColumnWidget``.\n- The cabinet view permission is now required for a document, to be able to\n  view which cabinets contain that document. This change mirrors the\n  permission layout of the metadata and tag apps.\n- File caching now uses the same lock for all file methods. This ensures that\n  a cache file that is being deleted or purge is not open for reading and\n  vice versa.\n- A method decorator was added to the lock manager app to ease usage of the\n  same lock workflow in methods of the same class.\n- The error handling of the ``CachePartitionFile`` methods was improved.\n  This ensures proper clean up of stray storage files on model file creation\n  error. The model now avoids accessing the model file for clean up on model\n  file creation error, which would raise a hard to understand and diagnose\n  missing file entry error. The model now avoids updating cache size on\n  either model or storage file creation error.\n- Support disabling form help texts via ``form_hide_help_text``.\n- Docker image tagging layout has been updated. Images are tagged by version\n  and series. Series have the 's' prefix and versions have the 'v' prefix.\n- Added API endpoints for the Assets model.\n- Added cached image generation for assets.\n- Added asset detail view with image preview.\n- Added a detail view for the cache model.\n- Added the ``image_url`` field to the Workflow template serializer.\n- Added retry support for the workflow preview generation task.\n- Updated the autoadmin app to use the login template ``login_content``\n  template hook. This allows the autoadmin app to show login information\n  without directly modifying the login template.\n- Update tags app to improve user event tracking on view and API.\n- Support deleting multiple document files.\n- Track document file deletion event user in views.\n- Rename ``setting_workflowimagecache_storage`` to\n  ``setting_workflow_image_cache_storage_backend``.\n- Support collapsing the options of the menus \"list facet\" and \"object\" when\n  in list view mode. This behavior is controlled with the new settings:\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_LIST_FACET`` and\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_OBJECT``. Both default to ``False``.\n- Added a check to the task manager app to ensure all defined tasks are\n  properly configure in their respective ``queues.py`` modules.\n- ACL apps updates: Add ACL deleted event, track action actor in API and\n  views. Simply API views using REST API mixins. Update API views to return\n  404 errors instead of 403, move global ACL list to the setup menu,\n  model that are registered for ACLs are now also automatically register\n  events in order to receive the ACL deleted event, improve tests and add more\n  test cases.\n- Update AddRemoveView to only call the underlying add or remove methods only\n  if there are objects to act upon instead of calling the method with an\n  empty queryset which would trigger unwanted events.\n- Add ``ExternalContentTypeObjectAPIViewMixin`` to the REST API app. This\n  mixin simplifies working with models that act upon another object via\n  their Content Type, such as the ACLs.\n- Update the ACL app to support multiple foreign object permission\n  inheritance. Support for ``GenericForeignKey`` non default ``ct_field``,\n  and ``fk_field`` was also added.\n- Added support to export the global events list, object events list and\n  user events list.\n- Registering a model to receive events will cause it to have the object\n  event view and object event subscription links bound too. This can\n  be disabled with the `bind_links` argument. The default menu to bind the\n  links is the \"List facet\". This can be changed via the ``menu`` argument.\n- Change the format of the ``file_metadata_value_of`` helper. The driver\n  and metadata entry are now separated by a double underscore instead of a\n  single underscore. This allows supporting drivers and entries that might\n  contain an underscore themselves.\n- Add ``databases`` app to group data and models related code.\n- Add class support for scoped searches. GitLab issue #875.\n- Add sorting support to the API.\n- Updated how the user interface column sorting works. The code was\n  simplified by using a single query variable. The code was expanded\n  to support multiple fields in the future. The URL query key used for\n  column sorting was changed to match the API sorting.a\n- Added the ``databases`` app. This app groups data and models related code.\n- Added a patch for Django's ``Migration`` class to display time delta for\n  each migration during development.\n- Docker Compose updates:\n\n    - Use profiles for extra containers.\n    - Converted to use extensions to remove duplicated markup.\n    - A new container was added to mount an index.\n    - Added support for Traefik.\n    - Added sample .env file.\n    - Update required Docker Compose to version 1.28.\n\n- Add a third document filename generator that used an UUID plus the original\n  filename of the uploaded file. This generator has the advantage of producing\n  unique filename while also preserving the original filename for reference.\n- Add support for the \"Reply To\" field for sending documents via email and\n  for the mailing workflow actions. Closes GitLab issue #864. Thanks to\n  Kevin Pawsey (@kevinpawsey) for the request.\n- Allow customization of the error condition when generating document images.\n  This allows displaying more icons in addition to the generic document\n  image error with additional contextual information and popup messages\n  explaining the actual error condition.\n- Add key attributes to the document signature serializers. Forum topic 5085.\n  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.\n- Added key attributes to the document signature model as calculated\n  properties.\n- Move detached signature upload from the created endpoint to a\n  new /uploaded endpoint.\n- Added document signature events.\n- Refactored the workflows app.\n\n    - Rebalance permissions needed to transition a workflow instance.\n      The workflow instance transition permission is now needed for\n      the document and for either the transition or the workflow.\n    - Add more tests including trashed document tests.\n    - Split API tests into instance and template tests.\n    - Add `workflow-instance-log-entry-detail` end point.\n    - Add parent URL fields to serializers.\n    - Allow passing extra data when transitioning a workflow via the API.\n    - Limit state options to workflow when using the API. This matches\n      the UI behavior.\n\n- Renamed the AddRemove view ``main_object_method_add`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_name`` and ``main_object_method_remove`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_remove_name``.\n- Add ``has_translations`` flag to MayanAppConfig to indicate if the app\n  should have its translation files processed or ignored. Defaults to\n  ``True``.\n- Dependency version upgrades:\n\n  - coverage from 5.1 to 5.5.\n  - Django to 2.2.23.\n  - django-debug-toolbar to 3.2.\n  - django-extensions to 3.1.2.\n  - django-rosetta to 0.9.4.\n  - django-silk to 4.1.0.\n  - flake8 to 3.9.0.\n  - ipython to 7.22.0.\n  - pycounty to 20.7.3.\n  - requests to 2.25.1.\n  - Sphinx to 3.5.4.\n  - sh to 1.14.1.\n  - sphinx-autobuild to 2021.3.14.\n  - sphinx-sitemap to 2.2.0.\n  - sphinxcontrib-spelling to 7.1.0.\n  - tornado to 6.1.\n  - tox from 3.14.6 to 3.23.1.\n  - transifex-client to 0.14.2.\n  - twine to 3.4.1.\n  - wheel to 0.36.2.\n\n- Fix sub workflow launch state action.\n- Convert the workflow instance creation to a background task.\n- File caching app updates\n\n  - Add cache partition purge event.\n  - Use new event decorator.\n  - Use related object as the cache partition purge event action object.\n  - Allow cache prune to retry on LockError.\n  - Add maximum cache prune failure counter.\n  - Remove possible cache file lock name collision.\n\n- Add locking to the duplicated document scan code to workaround race\n  condition in Django bug #19544 when adding duplicated documents via\n  the many to many field ``.add()`` method.\n- Remove the default queue. All tasks must now be explicitly assigned to an\n  app defined queue.\n- Update file cache to use and LRU style eviction logic.\n- Only prune caches during startup if their maximum size changed.\n- Add detection of excessive cache pruning when cache size is too small for\n  the workload.\n- Detect and avoid duplicated queue names.\n- Add a fourth class of worker.\n- Re-balance queues.\n- Rename workers from ``fast``, ``medium``, and ``slow`` to ``A`` (fast),\n  ``B`` (new workers), ``C`` (medium), ``D`` (slow).\n- Add support for passing custom nice level to the workers when using the\n  Docker image ``run_worker`` command. The value is passed via the\n  ``MAYAN_WORKER_NICE_LEVEL`` environment variable. This variable defaults to\n  ``0``.\n- Avoid adding a transformation to a layer for which it was\n  not registered.\n- Add LayerError exception.\n- Fix redaction ACL support.\n- Add support for typecasting the values used to filter the ACL object\n  inherited fields.\n- Rename the ``mayan_settings`` directory, which is used to allow custom\n  setting modules, to the more intuitive ``user_settings``.\n\n\n",
