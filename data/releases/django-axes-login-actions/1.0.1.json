    "description": "Overview\n========\n\nPerform one or more actions if someone performed a login, e.g. to the\nadmin interface. This is based on django-axes.\nCurrently implemented action is to send a notification mail to the site admins.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* `django_axes` (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-axes/)\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n- Install:\n\n    pip install django-axes-login-action\n\n- Add `axes_login_action` to `INSTALLED_APPS`\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOn any login recognized by `django-axes`, `django-axes-login-actions` executes\nthe configured actions.\nBy default, a notification mail is sent to the configured site admins (\nsee Django's `ADMINS` setting). This is handled in `axes_login_actions.actions.email.notify`.\n\nYou can add or replace the default action with custom actions if you like.\nTo do so, set the setting `AXES_LOGIN_ACTIONS` to a list of paths to any callable\nfunction or class.\nEach configured action is called with a positional argument `instance` which is\na `axes.models.AccessAttempt` instance and the same kwargs as sent by the Django\n`django.db.models.signals.post_save` signal.\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n* 2015-08-16 - 1.0.1:\n    * Use importlib from Python instead from Django\n      (to remove Django deprecation warning)\n\n* 2014-05-25 - 1.0.0:\n    * Initial release\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015, Enrico Tröger\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n      and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name django-wakawaka nor the names of its contributors\n      may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without\n      specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
