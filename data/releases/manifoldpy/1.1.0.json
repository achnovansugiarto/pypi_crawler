    "description": "# manifold-markets-python\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vluzko/manifoldpy.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vluzko/manifoldpy)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/manifold-markets-python/badge/?version=latest)](https://manifold-markets-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n\nTools for analyzing [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/home) data. Currently has bindings for their API, and code for computing various accuracy metrics (Brier score, log score, calibration).\\\n\n\n[Full Documentation](https://manifold-markets-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Calibration\nThis is the most recent calibration graph for Manifold Markets. Markets with less than 4 unique traders are excluded. The calibration is generated from the probability *halfway* between market open and market close.\n\n[![Midmarket calibration](https://github.com/vluzko/manifoldpy/blob/main/docs/midway_calibration.png)](https://github.com/vluzko/manifoldpy/blob/main/docs/midway_calibration.png)\n\n## Installation\nThe package is on PyPI as [`manifoldpy`](https://pypi.org/project/manifoldpy/). It can be installed with:\n```\npip install manifoldpy\n```\nAlternatively, clone this repo and install with pip:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/vluzko/manifold-markets-python.git\ncd manifold-markets-python\npip install .\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\nGet a list containing every market:\n```\nfrom manifoldpy import api\nmarkets = api.get_all_markets()\n```\n\nManifold also has a POST API that lets you make/resolve/bet on markets. This requires you to have an API key (which you can generate on your [Manifold profile page](https://manifold.markets/profile)). Here's an example for making a bet on a binary market:\n```\nfrom manifoldpy import api\n# Amount to spend\namount = 100\n# The ID of the market to bet on\ncontract_id = \"8Lt9ZTHCPCK58gtn0Y8n\"\n# The outcome you want to bet on.\noutcome = \"YES\"\napi.make_bet(YOUR_API_KEY, amount, contract_id, outcome)\n```\nIf you want to avoid passing the key every time, you can instead create an `APIWrapper` and use that:\n```\nfrom manifoldpy import api\nwrapper = api.APIWrapper(YOUR_API_KEY)\namount = 100\ncontract_id = \"8Lt9ZTHCPCK58gtn0Y8n\"\noutcome = \"YES\"\nwrapper.make_bet(amount, contract_id, outcome)\n```\n\nGet a market's history of probabilities:\n```\nfrom manifoldpy import api\nmarket = api.get_market(\"market_id\")\ntimes, probabilities = market.probability_history()\n```\n\nGenerate a basic calibration graph:\n```\nfrom manifoldpy import api, calibration\nfull_markets = api.get_full_markets()\nbinary = [\n    m for m in full_markets if isinstance(m, api.BinaryMarket) and m.isResolved\n]\ndf, histories = calibration.build_dataframe(binary)\n\nyes_markets = df[df[\"resolution\"] == \"YES\"]\nno_markets = df[df[\"resolution\"] == \"NO\"]\n\n# Calibration at start\nyes_probs = yes_markets[\"start\"]\nno_probs = no_markets[\"start\"]\ncalibration = calibration.market_set_accuracy(yes_probs, no_probs)\n```\n\nThere are additional examples for analyzing market calibration in the `scripts/` directory.\n",
