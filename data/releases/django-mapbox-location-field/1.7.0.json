I didn't find anything which suits my needs in 100% and that is why I created this simple django app. My philosopy was simplicity but I wanted to create complete solution for picking location.  \n  \nFeel free to open issues, make pull request and request some features or instructions. Let me know if you think it is not flexible enought.  \n# Live demo  \nCurious how it works and looks like ? See live demo on https://django-mapbox-location-field.herokuapp.com  \nDemo app uses [django-bootstrap4](https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap4) for a little better looking form fields.  \nYou can also use it as a code example, because it is available on [my github](https://github.com/Simon-the-Shark/live_demo_django_mapbox_location_field).  \n# Compatibility  \nAutomatically tested on Travis CI on versions:  \n  \n* Django 1.11, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2  \n* Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7  \n  \nPS. Django 1.11 does not support Python 3.7 anymore.  \n  \n#### Browser support  \ndjango-mapbox-location-field support all browsers, which are suported by mapbox gl js. Read more [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/mapbox-browser-support/#mapbox-gl-js)  \n#### Databases support  \nIt should work with every **spatial** and **plain** (non-spatial) database, that works with django and geodjango.  \n# Versions >1.4.0  \n  Since version 1.4.0 the order of coordinates convention has been changed. Now the order is `longitude, latitude`. This change has been caused by support for spatial databases. But more user friendly is order `latitude, longitude`(google maps uses it). That's why coordinates are falsely swapped in frontend and then after POST request in form field are swapped back into `longitude, latitude` order and saved to database.  \n My conclusion is that the location is falsely swapped in fronend and if you create location without our custom form field or just operate on raw model in backend, you will have to use the `longitude, latitude` order.  \n Versions before 1.4.0 always uses `latitude, longitude` order.  \n# Instalation  \nUsing pip:  \n    `pip install django-mapbox-location-field`  \n  \n# Configuration  \n* Add `\"mapbox_location_field\"` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings file  \n  \n```python  \nINSTALLED_APPS += (\"mapbox_location_field\",)  \n```  \n  \n* Define [MAPBOX_KEY](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/) in your settings file. This is vulnerable information which has to be passed to frontend, so it can be easily access by user. To ensure your safety, I would recommend using [url restrictions](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/#url-restrictions) and [public scopes](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/#scopes). More information on linked websites.  \n```python  \nMAPBOX_KEY = \"pk.eyJ1IjoibWlnaHR5c2hhcmt5IiwiYSI6ImNqd2duaW4wMzBhcWI0M3F1MTRvbHB0dWcifQ.1sDAD43q0ktK1Sr374xGfw\"  \n```  \n**PS. This above is only example access token. You have to paste here yours.**  \n  \n# Usage  \n* ### PLAIN DATABASE  \n * Just create some model with LocationField.  \n        ```python  \n from django.db import models from mapbox_location_field.models import LocationField  \n class SomeLocationModel(models.Model):  \n location = LocationField()  \n  \n ```* ### SPATIAL DATABASE  \n * Just create some model with SpatialLocationField.  \n        ```python  \n from django.db import models from mapbox_location_field.spatial.models import SpatialLocationField  \n class SomeLocationModel(models.Model):  \n location = SpatialLocationField()  \n  \n ```  \n* Create ModelForm  \n    ```python  \n from django import forms from .models import Location  \n class LocationForm(forms.ModelForm):  \n class Meta:  \n model = Location fields = \"__all__\" ```  Of course you can also use CreateView, UpdateView or build Form yourself with `mapbox_location_field.forms.LocationField` or `mapbox_location_field.spatial.forms.SpatialLocationField`  \n* Then just use it in html view. It can't be simpler!  \nPaste this in your html head:  \n    ```django  \n {% load mapbox_location_field_tags %} {% location_field_includes %} {% include_jquery %} ```* And this in your body:  \n    ```django  \n <form method=\"post\"> {% csrf_token %} {{form}} <input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\"> </form> {{ form.media }} ```* Your form is ready! Start your website and see how it looks. If you want to change something look to the [customization](#customization) section.  \n  \n# Customization  \nIn order to change few things you have to use `map_attrs` dictionary.  \nDefault `map_attrs` looks like this:  \n```python  \ndefault_map_attrs = {  \n \"style\": \"mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v11\", \"zoom\": 13, \"center\": [17.031645, 51.106715], \"cursor_style\": 'pointer', \"marker_color\": \"red\", \"rotate\": False, \"geocoder\": True, \"fullscreen_button\": True, \"navigation_buttons\": True, \"track_location_button\": True, \"readonly\": True, \"placeholder\": \"Pick a location on map below\", }```  \nTo change some values, just pass it when you creates model.  \n```python  \nfrom django.db import models  \nfrom mapbox_location_field.models import LocationField  \n  \nclass Location(models.Model):  \n location = LocationField(map_attrs={\"center\": [0,0], \"marker_color\": \"blue\"})  \n```  \n## map_attrs  \n* style - `<string>`, mapbox style url. Read more [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/style-url/).  \n* zoom - `<int>`, map's zoom. Read more [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/zoom-level/).  \n* center - `<list>` or `<tuple>` of `<float>`s, defaults map's center point in [`latitude`, `longitude`]  \n* cursor_style - `<string>`, css cursor style. Read more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp).  \n* marker_color - `<string>` css color property. Read more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp)  and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).  \n* rotate - `<bool>`, whether you can rotate map with right mouse click or not.  \n* geocoder -`<bool>`, whether geocoder searcher is showed or not.  \n* fullscreen_button - `<bool>`, whether fullscreen button is showed or not.  \n* navigation_buttons - `<bool>`, whether navigation buttons are showed or not.  \n* track_location_button - `<bool>`, whether show my location button is showed or not.  \n* readonly - `<bool>`, whether user can type location in text input  \n* placeholder - `<string>`, text input's placeholder  \n* id - `<string>`, unique id for field, when your are using multiple fields (See more in [this section](#multiple-fields-usage)). When you use only one field, you don't have to define it, because default value is taken.  \n  \n## bootstrap  \nMapInput widget is fully compatibile with bootstrap library. I can even recommend to use it with [django-bootstrap4](https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap4) or [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms).  \n  \n# Admin interface usage  \nFirst create some model with location field like in [usage section](#usage).  \nThen register it in admin interface like this:  \n* #### Plain:  \n```python  \nfrom django.contrib import admin  \nfrom .models import SomeLocationModel  \nfrom mapbox_location_field.admin import MapAdmin  \n  \nadmin.site.register(SomeLocationModel, MapAdmin)  \n```  \n* #### Spatial:  \n```python  \nfrom django.contrib import admin  \nfrom .models import SomeLocationModel  \nfrom mapbox_location_field.spatial.admin import SpatialMapAdmin  \n  \nadmin.site.register(SomeLocationModel, SpatialMapAdmin)  \n```  \n* #### Admin customization:  \nSince `v1.7.0` admin customization should work out of the box, automatically using the `map_attrs` from model definition. \n  \n# AddressAutoHiddenField  \nAddressAutoHiddenField is field for storing address. It uses AddressAutoHiddenInput which is hidden and when you place your marker on map, automatically fill itself with proper address.  \nIn order to use it just add it to your model. Something like this:  \n```python  \nclass Location(models.Model):  \n location = LocationField()  \n address = AddressAutoHiddenField()  \n```  \n# Multiple fields usage  \nSince version 1.6.0, it is now possible to use multiple LocationFields (or forms or widgets) as well as multiple AutoHiddenAddressFields. All you have to do is define unique `id` in `map_attrs`:  \n```python  \nlocation1 = LocationField(map_attrs={\"id\": \"unique_id_1\"})  \nlocation2 = LocationField(map_attrs={\"id\": \"unique_id_2\"})  \n```  \nand then you can also use this ids as `map_id` in your AutoHiddenAddressFields:  \n```python  \naddress1 = AddressAutoHiddenField(map_id=\"unique_id_1\")  \naddress2 = AddressAutoHiddenField(map_id=\"unique_id_2\")  \n```  \n# Troubleshooting  \n* #### Usage of the plain field's value in javascript ( [Issue #21](https://github.com/Simon-the-Shark/django-mapbox-location-field/issues/21))\n\tIn case of the plain field, the python representation of coordinates is a  [tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp). And  e.g Mapbox's requires a [javascript's array](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) when placing a marker on a map, which has identical syntax as  [Python's list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp). In order to make the trasformation as easy as possible, since `v1.6.4` you can use a special filter or a tag (\nchoose your preferred way)\n\t```Django\n\t{% load mapbox_location_field_tags %}\n\t<script>\n\tvar lngLatWithFilter = {{object.location | tuple_to_array }};\n\tvar lngLatWithTag = {% tuple_to_array object.location %};\n\t\n\t// These are just two ways, which give the same result\n\t// Now you can use one of this variables as an array\n\t</script>\n\t```\n# Technologies  \n* Django  \n* mapbox gl js  \n* jQuery  \n* html and css",
