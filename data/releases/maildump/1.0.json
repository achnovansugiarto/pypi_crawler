    "description": "MailDump\n========\n\nMailDump is a python-based clone of the awesome `MailCatcher`_ tool. Its\npurpose is to provide developers a way to let applications send emails\nwithout actual emails being sent to anyone. Additionally lazy developers\nmight prefer this over a real SMTP server simply for the sake of it\nbeing much easier and faster to set up.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nSince the goal of this project is to have the same features as\nMailCatcher I suggest you to read its readme instead.\n\nHowever, there is one unique feature in MailDump: Password protection for\nthe web interface. If your MailDump instance is listening on a public IP\nyou might not want your whole company to have access to it. Instead you can\nuse an Apache-style htpasswd file. I have tested it with SHA-encrypted\npasswords but you can use any encryption supported by `passlib.apache`_.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nAfter installing maildump, run ``maildump --help`` for a list of available\ncommand line arguments.  By default maildump runs its webserver on port\n1080 and its SMTP server on port 1025 (both only available via localhost).\nUnless you specify a database file, received mails are lost when maildump\nterminates.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThe layout of the web interface has been taken from MailCatcher. No\nCopy&Paste involved - I rewrote the SASS/Compass stylesheet from\nMailCatcher in SCSS as there is a pure-python implementation of SCSS\navailable. If whoever reads this feels like creating a new layout that\nlooks as good or even better feel free to send a pull request. I'd\nactually prefer a layout that differs from MailCatcher at least a little\nbit but I'm somewhat bad at creating layouts!\n\nThe icon was created by `Tobia Crivellari`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright © 2013-2020 Adrian Mönnich (adrian@planetcoding.net).
