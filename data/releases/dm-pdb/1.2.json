    "description": "Dieter Maurer's PDB extension.\n==============================\n\n``Pdb``, the Python debugger, has severe limitations (apart from some bugs).\nThis extension tries to get rid of some of them.\n\nThings done\n-----------\n\n * setting breakpoints\n\n   Allow *filename* to specify a module as well.\n\n   Allow setting breakpoints from outside via ``do_break``.\n   This is useful for debug setups.\n\n * exception display\n\n   The current display of an exception is almost useless.\n   In the ``Pdb`` code, exceptions are displayed at 4 places --\n   and each of them uses slightly different code (whow!).\n\n   We consolidate this into a single function ``_handle_exception``\n   and present the exception with ``traceback.format_exception_only``.\n   We also store the exception in the ``Pdb`` instance.\n   A new command ``exception`` (abbreviated ``e``) presents this\n   stored exception value in a way similar to the ``where`` command.\n\n\n * ``where`` command improvements\n\n   - each frame identifies its level (the top frame is at level 0,\n     the one below it at level 1, etc...)\n\n   - the current frame is marked as such\n\n   - ``where`` gets optional arguments *number* and *end*\n\n     *number* controls how many frames are displayed (default: ``maxint``),\n     *end* at what level the display ends, negative numbers count from\n     the bottom (default: ``-1``, i.e. the bottom frame).\n\n * new command ``frame level`` (abbr: ``f``)\n\n   switch to call frame at *level*\n\n   without argument, provide info about current frame\n\n * allow to customize the display of the ``where`` command\n   and of tracebacks\n   e.g. to display additional debugging information as\n   provided by Zope (for example).\n\n   This can be done by customizing ``getAdditionalFrameInfo``.\n\nThings not yet done\n-------------------\n\n * Returning from ``debug`` occasionally returns to ``stop``\n   rather than where we entered the recursive debugger.\n   This is often nasty (and should be fixed)\n\nVersion history\n---------------\n\n1.2\n,,,\n\n * fixed: ``do_break`` sometimes failed to resolve functions correctly.\n\n1.1\n,,,\n\n * improved handling of errors in command argument parsing\n\n * Python 2.6 compatibility\n\n\n1.0.4\n,,,,,\n\n * work around Python monkey patching ``set_trace`` inside a doctest.\n\n1.0.3\n,,,,,\n\n * fix ``debug`` to use the current ``Pdb`` class, not Python's.\n\n1.0.2\n,,,,,\n\n * let external calls to ``do_break`` work even after the first ``run``.",
