    "description": "====================\ndjango-dogstorage\n====================\ndogstorage is a so called *development storage engine*.\n\nMany people have the problem with gigantomanic production databases with \ngigabytes of pictures/files. It is a pain to keep the image files synchronised \nbetween development and production environments. \n\nTherefore I have written this storage engine. In case a file is not found, \nan image from placedog.com_ will be used/displayed\ninstead.\n\nIf you are sick of dogs, you might want to check out _django-kittenstorage_.\n\nSetup\n=====\nIt's on pypi.\n\n    ``pip install django-dogstorage``\n\nFeel free to clone from github too. Forking is welcome as well :-)\n\nIn your django settings file:\n\n    ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'dogstorage.storages.GreyDog'``\n\nStorage Engines\n===============\ndogstorage offers two engines:\n\n1. ``dogstorage.storages.GreyDog``\n2. ``dogstorage.storages.ColorDog``\n\nChoose depending on the saturation you want. I prefer ``GreyDog`` since it \ndoes have a pretty classy look.\n\nSettings\n========\nThere is only one setting:\n\nDOG_SIZE  \n    Default: ``(1024, 1024)``\n\n    A tuple of format `(width, height)`, specifiying the size of the image \n    requested from placedog__.\n\n\n.. _placedog.com: http://placedog.com/\n__ placedog.com_",
