    "description": "A pretty simple parser for [Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com). I find the site impossible to look at and wanted a way to more easily digest the information, as I like to keep tabs on lots of differing news outlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPyPI\r\n\r\n    pip install drudge_parser\r\n\r\nNote: This is only compatible with Python3+ (they added context manager support to [`urlopen`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request) in the stdlib)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    import drudge_parser\r\n\r\n    # scrape_site is a generator of (Article, Image)\r\n    articles = drudge_parser.scrape_site()\r\n\r\n    for article, image in articles:\r\n        # image may be None, if none was found that is considered as\r\n        # related to the article. In many cases, the same image will\r\n        # be yielded for multiple articles.\r\n        print(article, image)",
