    "description": "django-jsonfield\n===================\n\n.. image:: https://codeship.com/projects/2e1a3d30-7db7-0132-629f-4abd151a3721/status?branch=default\n\nI had a serious need for a JSON field for django. There were a couple out\nthere, but none packaged up nicely on bitbucket/github that were usable\nwith ``pip install -e``.\n\nSo I took the code from `David Cramer's blog`_, and packaged it up.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo use, just install the package, and then use the field::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    import jsonfield\n\n    class MyModel(models.Model):\n        the_json = jsonfield.JSONField()\n\nYou can assign any JSON-encodable object to this field. It will be\nJSON-encoded before being stored in the database as a text value and it\nwill be turned back into a python list/dict/string upon retrieval from the\ndatabase.\n\nThere is also a ``TypedJSONField``, that allows you to define data types that must be included within each object in the array. More documentation to follow.\n\n\nNotes\n~~~~~\n\nIf no ``default`` is provided, and ``null=True`` is not passed in to the\nfield constructor, then a default of ``{}`` will be used.\n\n\nSupported django versions\n-------------------------\n\nAll versions of Django from 1.8 onwards are tested, however, if you are using Postgres, I highly recommend that you consider using the ``django.contrib.postgres`` module's ``JSONField`` instead.\n\nExtras\n------\n\njsonify templatetag\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis allows you to convert a python data structure into JSON within a template::\n\n    {% load jsonify %}\n\n    <script>\n    var foo = {{ bar|jsonify|safe }};\n    </script>\n\nNote that you must only use the \"safe\" filter when you use the jsonify\nfilter within a <script> tag (which is parsed like a CDATA section).\n\nIf you use it in some other places like in an HTML attribute, then\nyou must not use the safe filter so that its output is properly escaped::\n\n    <div data-foo=\"{{ bar|jsonify }}\">\n\nThe above rules are important to avoid XSS attacks with unsafe strings\nstored in the converted data structure.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\n1.0.1\n~~~~~~\nFix issue with Postgres JSONB fields.\nLimit XSS attacks with jsonify template tag.\n\n\n1.0.0\n~~~~~\n\nAdd support for Django 1.8 and 1.9 (without warnings). Remove support for Django < 1.8\nas none of those releases are supported upstream anyway.\n\nWith this version, ``JSONField`` no longer decodes assigned string values as JSON. Instead it assumes that any value that you assign is the decoded value which will be JSON-encoded before storage in the database. This explains the bump to version 1.0 as it's a backwards incompatible change.\n\n0.9.19\n~~~~~~\nAllow passing `decoder_kwargs` as an argument to a field. This dict will be passed as kwargs to\nthe `json.loads()` calls when loading data that is a string.\n\nYou may also set this as a global value in settings.JSONFIELD_DECODER_KWARGS.\n\nA new dict is created for each field: so if this value is altered after field definition, it shouldn't\naffect already attached fields.\n\n0.9.16\n~~~~~~\nAllow passing an argument of `encoder_class` to a field, which will result in that object (or\nthe object located at that path, for instance `core.utils.JSONEncoder`) being used as the `cls`\nargument when serializing objects.\n\nYou may also set this as a global value in settings.JSONFIELD_ENCODER_CLASS\n\n0.9.15\n~~~~~~\nBump version number to get around uploading issues.\n\n0.9.14\n~~~~~~\nNo longer hit the db to work out db_type.\n\n0.9.12\n~~~~~~\nCache the result of db_type.\nHandle incoming data from multiple select widget better.\n\n0.9.9\n~~~~~\nFinally strip out non-required files.\n\n0.9.8\n~~~~~\nRemove freezegun workarounds.\nFix broken build.\n\n0.9.4\n~~~~~\nFixes for mutable defaults: we serialize and then deserialize in this\ncase, so you can still use ``default={}``.\n\n0.9.3\n~~~~~\nRemove support for storing data using Postgres' 9.2's JSON data type, as\nyou cannot currently query against this!\n\nRemove support for django < 1.3.\n\n\n0.9.0\n~~~~~\nAdd LICENSE file.\nAdded TypedJSONField.\n\n\n0.8.10\n~~~~~~\nAllow ``{{ variable|jsonify }}`` to work with querysets.\n\n0.8.8\n~~~~~\nPrevent circular import problem with django 1.3.1 and gargoyle.\n\n0.8.7\n~~~~~\nBetter handle null=True and blank=True: it should make sense what they do now.\n\n0.8.5\n~~~~~\nAllow for '{}' and '[]', and make them not appear to be None.\n\n0.8.4\n~~~~~\nEnsure the version number file is installed with the package.\n\n0.8.3\n~~~~~\nStore the version number in one place only, now.\n\n0.8.2\n~~~~~\nOops. Packaging error prevented install from pypi. Added README.rst to manifest.\n\n0.8.1\n~~~~~\nConverting to string does nothing, as serializing a model instance with a JSONField would have a string version of that field, instead of it embedded inline. (Back to pre 0.8 behaviour).\n\nAdded better querying support: (``field__contains={'key':'value','key2':'value2'}`` works.)\n\nRemoved JSONTableWidget from package.\n\n0.8\n~~~\n(Many thanks to `IanLewis`_ for these features)\n\nSupports django 1.2\n\nSupports callable and json serializable objects as default\n\nImplemented get_db_prep_value()\n\nAdd tests and test runner.\n\nRemoved JSONTableWidget from README.\n\n0.7.1\n~~~~~\nDon't fail when trying to install before django is installed.\n\n0.7\n~~~\nFirst time I tagged releases.\n\n\nTodo\n----------\nAllow for passing in a function to use for processing unknown data types.\n\nConvert date/time objects nicely to/from ISO strings (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS\nTZNAME). This is actually a bit tricky, as we don't know if we are expecting\na date/time object. We may parse objects as we go, but there could be\nsome performance issues with this. I'm tempted to say \"only do this on TypedJSONField()\"\n\n.. _David Cramer's blog: http://justcramer.com/2009/04/14/cleaning-up-with-json-and-sql/\n.. _IanLewis: https://bitbucket.org/IanLewis",
