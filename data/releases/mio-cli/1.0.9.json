The CLI consists of a succinct and powerful command set which developers use via a terminal on their operating system (Windows/Linux/OSX). |\n\n\n\n## Installation\n`mio` can be installed directly from [`pip3`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n\n````\npip3 install mio-cli\n````\n\n\n## [Developer Guide](https://datum-technology-corporation.github.io/mio_cli_client/dev_guide.html)\n\n## [Demo Project](https://github.com/Datum-Technology-Corporation/mio_demo)\n\n\n\n\n## Usage\n````\n  mio [--version] [--help]\n  mio [--wd WD] [--dbg] CMD [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --version\n    Prints the mio version and exits.\n  \n  -h, --help\n    Prints the overall synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands and exits.\n    \n  -C WD, --wd WD\n    Run as if mio was started in WD (Working Directory) instead of the Present Working Directory `pwd`.\n   \n  --dbg\n    Enables debugging outputs from mio.\n\nFull Command List (`mio help CMD` for help on a specific command):\n   Help and Shell/Editor Integration\n      doctor         Runs a set of checks to ensure mio installation has what it needs to operate properly\n      help           Prints documentation for mio commands\n   \n   Project and Code Management\n      init           Starts project creation dialog\n      new            Creates new source code via the mio template engine\n   \n   IP and Credentials Management\n      install        Install all IP dependencies from IP Marketplace\n      login          Start session with IP Marketplace\n      package        Create a compressed (and potentially encrypted) archive of an IP\n      publish        Publish IP to IP Marketplace (must have mio admin account)\n   \n   EDA Automation\n      !
