Optional LRU caching of deserialized values. Thread-safe operations. No added reserved keys, *etc.*\n\n* Provides value-serializing `SafeLmdbDict` and str-only `StrLmdbDict`, as well as abstract base class `LmdbDict` for customization of database encoding.\n\n* Unique-key, labeled and unlabeled databases and read-write sessions supported.\n\n-----\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Use](#use)\n  - [General use](#general-use)\n  - [Caching](#caching)\n  - [Str-only](#str-only)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installation\n\n```console\npip install lmdb-dict-full\n```\n\n## Use\n\n### General use\n\n`SafeLmdbDict` provides the full `dict` interface to a LMDB database at a given filesystem path. (An empty database is automatically provisioned within a directory without one.)\n\nValues are automatically serialized (deserialized) and compressed (decompressed) using [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) and [zlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html).\n\n```python\nfrom lmdb_dict import SafeLmdbDict\n\ndbdict = SafeLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/0/')\n\ndbdict['aaa'] = {'values': [0, 1, 'x']}\n```\n\nOne or more named databases are also supported.\n\nLMDB requires that the maximum number of named databases is specified up-front. Below we'll only need two named databases.\n\n```python\nusers = SafeLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/1/', name='users', max_dbs=2)\n\nhats = SafeLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/1/', name='hats', max_dbs=2)\n```\n\nNote that it would otherwise be unsafe to hold open multiple `lmdb` client objects within a single process at once. This is handled automatically: a weak reference is kept to the client opened for each filesystem path and reused for each `LmdbDict` requiring it.\n\n### Caching\n\nCaching of LMDB itself *should not be necessary*. The database \"fully exploits the operating system’s buffer cache\" and memory mapping [[ref]](https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/).\n\nMoreover, `lmdb-dict` makes every effort to use `lmdb` efficiently, such that the user need not be concerned with undue overhead of interacting with the database-backed dictionary.\n\nThat said: the value serialization layer of `SafeLmdbDict` is another matter. Given sufficiently hefty values to deserialize, it *may* be worthwhile to engage the `lmdb-dict` caching layer, along with the trade-offs that it entails.\n\n#### Caveats\n\n**`lmdb-dict` caching is thread-safe**\n\nThis is achieved with behind-the-scenes locking – narrowly applied to singular keys where feasible – but the small overhead of which applies when caching.\n\n**`lmdb-dict` caching is *not* (yet) *automatically* process-safe**\n\nCaching is thread-safe thanks to thread locks and (again) weak references to caches which must be shared across dictionaries backed by the same databases.\n\nAchieving the same under a multiprocessing regime would be another matter.\n\nUsers may nonetheless make use of `lmdb-dict` while multiprocessing, either without caching or with thoughtful application of caches across processes.\n\n#### Options\n\nCaching is built into all concrete subclasses of `LmdbDict`; however, it is disabled by default, in that it is set to `DummyCache` – a mapping capable of storing zero items.\n\nSubclasses of `LmdbDict` check their cache for its maximum capacity by means of: `getattr(cache, 'maxsize', …)`. A cache reporting `maxsize=0` – such as the `DummyCache` – will be given *dummy locks*, such that locking is disabled for this dictionary.\n\nA cache reporting any other `maxsize` – or lacking this property – is treated as a proper cache, and locking will be applied.\n\nCaching may be specified – to `SafeLmdbDict` for example – via an instance, a class, or any callable returning an instance of a mapping for use as a deserialization cache. Either an instance or a class are strongly recommended, as these enable checking any cache retrieved from the weak reference registry against the user's instantiation argument.\n\n```python\nfrom lmdb_dict.cache import LRUCache128\n\nSafeLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/', cache=LRUCache128)\n```\n\nAbove, we've specified that our `SafeLmdbDict` should cache deserialized values using an instance of `LRUCache128` – that is, a subclass of the `LRUCache` provided by [cachetools](https://pypi.org/project/cachetools/). `LRUCache128` distinguishes itself only in that it requires no initialization arguments – a requirement of supplying a callable in lieu of a cache instance – and it sets `maxsize=128`.\n\nAs a shortcut to the above, `lmdb-dict` provides `CachedLmdbDict`:\n\n```python\nfrom lmdb_dict import CachedLmdbDict\n\nCachedLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/')\n```\n\n`CachedLmdbDict` differs from other subclasses of `LmdbDict` in that it defaults to caching via `LRUCache128`. Other caches may be specified via the `cache` argument. Supplying an entity with property `maxsize=0` – such as the `DummyCache` – will raise a `TypeError`.\n\n### Str-only\n\nThe above concrete subclasses of `LmdbDict` support arbitrary serializable values in order to best mimic the functionality of the Python `dict`.\n\nFor use-cases supporting str-only (and/or bytes-only) values, all of the above concerns over serialization, caching and locking may be sidestepped.\n\n`StrLmdbDict` provides the same full-featured `dict` interface to LMDB, but only for values of type `str` and `bytes`.\n\n```python\nfrom lmdb_dict import StrLmdbDict\n\nStrLmdbDict('/path/to/db/directory/')\n```\n\n`StrLmdbDict` further differs from other subclasses of `LmdbDict` in that it accepts no `cache` argument, and may not perform caching.\n\n## License\n\n`lmdb-dict` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.\n",
