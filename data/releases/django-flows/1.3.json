    "description": "django-flows can best be described as 'wizards on steroids'. Its purpose is to keep state and position\nin complicated flows of logic, allowing optional branches and complicated paths through a series of\nindividual user actions.\n\ndjango-flows makes it possible to specify subsections of functionality and group them together later.\nIt recognises that, at the core, there are several user actions such as logging in, or entering a credit\ncard number, and that the web application needs to group these actions in such a way that all state\nrequired to make a purchase, for example, is obtained. It also seeks to make these actions reusable,\nand to group related actions together into larger 'user flows'.",
