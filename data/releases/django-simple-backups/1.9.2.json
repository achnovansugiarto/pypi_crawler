    "description": "# django-simple-backups\n\n\n## Introduction\nThis django app gives you a simple management command to backup your sqlite or mysql database and media files to dropbox.\nThis was created because had countless errors for me and it was easier to just create a new package. All contributions are welcome. Please just submit a pull request with a short description of the fix or new feature added. \nPlease note currently this app will not delete old backups. if you want to delete backups then you have to go to dropbox and do it yourself.\n\n## Installation\n\n    pip install django-simple-backups\n\nAdd `backups` to your Django settings INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        # ...\n        \"backups\",\n    ]\n\n### Settings\n    # other required settings\n\n    # must use default database and must use 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3' or 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n\n    # must have MEDIA_ROOT\n    # must be to absolute path\n    \n    MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'somepath'\n\n    # simple backups settings\n    # must have refresh token, app_key, app_secret\n\n    # how to get refresh token stackoverflow.com/a/71794390/14665310]\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN = \"<refresh_token>\"\n    # get app key from dropbox.com/developers => choose your app => find app key\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_APP_KEY = '<app_key>'\n    # get app key from dropbox.com/developers => choose your app => find app key\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_APP_SECRET = \"<app_secret>\"\n\n    # folder in drop box to save all database files to default is \"/database/\"\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_DATABASE_PATH = \"/database/\"\n    # folder in drop box to save all media folders to. | for each backup a folder with todays date will be added your website media files will get added to that folder\n    # default is \"/media/\"\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_MEDIA_PATH = \"/media/\"\n\n    # format of the date that the backups will use to rename\n    # see for date codes https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_date_format_codes.asp\n    # default is \"%c\" - Mon Dec 31 17:41:00 2018\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_RENAME_DATE_FORMAT = \"%c\"\n\n    # set this to true (default false) if you want the mysql files to be gzipped before being uploaded to dropbox.\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_USE_GZIP = True\n\n## Management commands\n\n### manage.py backupmedia \ncreates a new folder in dropbox with the current date as the name of the folder. \nFor example if your media folder structure looks like:\n\n    media\n    |   file one\n    |   file two\n    |   documents\n    |   |   document one\n\nthen your uploaded dropbox folder will look like\n\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_MEDIA_PATH/current_date media backup\n    |   file one\n    |   file two\n    |   documents\n    |   |   document one\n### manage.py backupdatabase\n* copies your database\n* uploads to dropbox at `SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_DATABASE_PATH/current_date | db.sqlite3`\n\n### changelog\n1.9 added gzipping sql file backups only used for django.db.backends.mysql\n\n1.8 fixed problem with mysql database not authenticating with password with special characters.\n\n1.7 added mysql backup support\n\n1.6 uses refresh token instead of authentication token must add these settings\n    \n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN = \"<refresh_token>\"\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_APP_KEY = '<app_key>'\n    SIMPLE_BACKUPS_APP_SECRET = \"<app_secret>\"\n[see how to get refresh token](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71794390/14665310])\n| removed SIMPLE_BACKUPS_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN setting\n\n1.5 added dependencies to the installation\n\n1.1 fixed issue installing library in django\n\n1.0 first release\n\n\n",
