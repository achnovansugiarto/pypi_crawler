    "description": "#  DPsim\n\n[![build status](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/core/simulation/dpsim/badges/master/build.svg)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/core/simulation/dpsim/commits/master)\n[![coverage report](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/core/simulation/dpsim/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/core/simulation/dpsim/commits/master)\n\nDPsim is a solver library for power system simulation.\n\n- It supports both the electro-magnetic transient (EMT) and dynamic phasor (DP) domain.\n- It provides a Python module which can be embedded in any Python 3 application / scripts.\n- It is implemented in highly-efficient C++ code.\n- It supports real-time execution with time-steps up to 50 uS.\n- It can load models in the [Common Information Model (CIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28electricity%29) XML format.\n- It can be interfaced to a variety of protocols and interfaces via [VILLASnode](http://www.fein-aachen.org/projects/villas-framework/).\n\n## Installation\nIf you just want to use DPsim for simulations, take a look at the [installation instructions](https://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/sphinx/Install.html).\n\nIf you would like to modify / extend DPsim or build it for a specific platform, take a look at the [build instructions](https://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/sphinx/Build.html).\n\n## Usage\nDPsim is a Python extension module which is implemented in optimized native C++ code. \nUsers can control and script the simulation with Python scripts. Checkout the [Examples](https://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/sphinx/Examples.html).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [user documentation](http://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/sphinx/) has examples, build / installation instructions and covers the Python API.\n\nThe C++ [developer documentation](http://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/doxygen/) only includes automatically generated content using Doxygen.\nIt is helpful to understand the general structure of the C++ DPsim core components.\n\n## Copyright\n\n2017, Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems, EONERC, RWTH Aachen University\n\n## License\n\nThis project is released under the terms of the [GPL version 3](https://dpsim.fein-aachen.org/doc/master/sphinx/Copying.html).\n\n```\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\nany later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
