    "description": "# django-popolo\n\nWelcome to the documentation for django-popolo!\n\n**django-popolo** is a django-based implementation of the\n[Popolo's open government data specifications](http://popoloproject.com/).\n\nIt is developed as a Django reusable app to be deployed directly within Django projects.\n\nIt will allow web developers using it to manage and store data according to Popolo's specifications.\n\nThe standard sql-oriented Django ORM will be used.\n\nFrom release 1.2.0, django-popolo includes classes that extend the model, although compatibility\nwith the standard is kept.\n\nRelease 2.0.0 introduces a change in how Sources and Links are referred to,\nthat breaks compatibility with the popit importer.\n\nRelease 3.0.0 main focuses have been to keep up with latest Django\nversions and to \"modernize\" the code base, adopting latest Python features (like type hinting), \nand doing some serious housekeeping. Python 2 is no longer supported. \nThis release also implements a lot of new models which are not part of the Popolo specification (mildly out of scope), \nbut we needed them in some projects which make use this package. Those new models can be safely ignored, and they could \nalso be removed in the future, as we are considering the option of entirely decoupling them from `django-popolo`. \n\n\nSee the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install `django-popolo` as a third party app within a django project,\nyou need to add it to the django project's requirements.txt.\nYou can do this from GitHub in the usual way, or using the\n`django-popolo` package on PyPI.\n\n## Notes on mysociety's fork\n\n[mysociety/django-popolo](https://github.com/mysociety/django-popolo) is a fork of this project where integer IDs are used\ninstead of slugs.\n\nOur packages, since version 1.1 also uses numerical ids as primary keys for all entities.\nSlugs are available as non-primary fields, for the 4 main classes (`Person`, `Organization`, `Post`, `Membership`).\nSlugs are used through the `Permalinkable` behavior, that adds the `slug` field to the class, populating it according to rules defined in each class.\n\n\n\n\n",
