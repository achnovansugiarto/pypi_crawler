    "description": "This package allows to work around\nweaknesses in the web application server Zope's security subsystem.\nCurrently, it contains a single module ``proxy``.\n\nproxy\n-----\n\nIn principle, Zope makes a clear distinction between trusted code\n(which comes from the file system and cannot be modified through-the-web)\nand untrusted code (which might be tangled with through-the-web).\nTrusted code is unrestricted by Zope's security subsystem,\nuntrusted code has permission checks on each object and method access.\n\nUnfortunately, occasionnally, trusted code performs its own\nsecurity checks -- and can raise ``Unauthorized`` exceptions even\nwhen called from other trusted code. The ``proxy`` module\nis destined to work around this behaviour.\nIt uses Zope's so called *proxy roles* to set up roles which\nshould be used for internal security checks.\n\nThe module defines two methods ``setup_proxy_roles(roles)`` and\n``cleanup_proxy_roles(context)``. They are used in the following idiom:\n\n>>> context = setup_proxy_roles((role1, role2, ...))\n>>> try:\n>>>   ... perform any operation with internal security checks ...\n>>> finally:\n>>>   cleanup_proxy_roles(context)\n\nThis sets up proxy roles *(role1, role2, ...)* to be used\nfor the following internal security checks until the following\n``cleanup_proxy_roles``.\n\nUsually, the roles are ``('Manager', 'Authenticated')`` but can be anything.\nNote that proxy roles override any currently active user roles.",
