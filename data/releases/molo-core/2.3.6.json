Specifically for that Molo allows a second argument for the\ndirectory.\n\nTo scaffold an application called ``myapp`` in the current directory do::\n\n   $ molo scaffold myapp .\n\nMolo, Django & settings files\n-----------------------------\n\nWhat you have now is a standard Django application set up for normal\ndevelopment like outlined in the Django documentation. The only main difference\nis that your settings are Python modules found in the\n``settings/dev.py`` and ``settings/production.py`` files in your applications\nfolder. Both of these inherit settings from ``settings/base.py``.\n\nTo create your own custom settings add a ``local.py`` file in the ``settings``\nfolder. The ``settings/dev.py`` will automatically include those settings\nfor your local development environment.\n\nWriting tests\n-------------\n\nNow develop your application and write tests for the features you add.\nRunning your tests for Django works as you would expect::\n\n   $ ./manage.py test\n\nWhat is bundled with Molo?\n--------------------------\n\n1. Basic feature phone template set.\n2. Basic models for the following tree structure:\n\n   1. A site has languages\n   2. A language has a homepage\n   3. Articles are organised into sections.\n   4. Articles are composed from one or more blocks.\n   5. Blocks can be headings, paragraphs, images, lists or\n      links to other pages.\n\nTesting the Molo scaffolding tool\n---------------------------------\n\nIf you're interested in working on or contributing to the code that\ndoes the scaffolding then clone this repository from the GitHub repository at\nhttp://github.com/praekelt/molo.\n\nInstall the requirement development & testing dependencies::\n\n   $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n\nAnd then run the full test suite with::\n\n   $ ./run-tests.sh\n\nPull requests are expected to follow Praekelt's `Ways Of Working`_.\n\n.. _`Ways of Working`: http://ways-of-working.rtfd.org",
