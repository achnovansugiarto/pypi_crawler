Specifically for that Molo allows a second argument for the\ndirectory.\n\nTo scaffold an application called ``myapp`` in the current directory do::\n\n   $ molo scaffold myapp .\n\nSpecifying extra requires\n=========================\n\nMolo in itself is not expected to be enough to deliver on a client request.\nDuring scaffolding use the ``--require`` commandline parameter to include\nmore libraries that are required for installation::\n\n   $ molo scaffold myapp --require=django-contrib-comments\n\nAdds the `django-contrib-comments` to the generated requirements file which\nis read by the generated package's ``setup.py`` file.\n\nMultiple requires can be specified on the command line::\n\n   $ molo scaffold myapp --require=django-contrib-comments \\\n                         --require=molo.profiles\n\nAutomatically adding installed apps\n===================================\n\nIf you're including a Django app chances are you're going to want to\nadd it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings as well as adding an entry\nto the generated ``urls.py`` file::\n\n   $ molo scaffold myapp --include=django_comments ^comments/\n\nThis results in the following ``urls.py`` entry::\n\n   url(r'^comments/',\n       include('django_comments.urls',\n               namespace='django_comments',\n               app_name='django_comments')),\n\n.. note:: multiple includes can be specified on the command line, the format\n          is ``--include=<app_name> <regex-for-urls>``\n\nMolo, Django & settings files\n-----------------------------\n\nWhat you have now is a standard Django application set up for normal\ndevelopment like outlined in the Django documentation. The only main difference\nis that your settings are Python modules found in the\n``settings/dev.py`` and ``settings/production.py`` files in your applications\nfolder. Both of these inherit settings from ``settings/base.py``.\n\nTo create your own custom settings add a ``local.py`` file in the ``settings``\nfolder. The ``settings/dev.py`` will automatically include those settings\nfor your local development environment.\n\nWriting tests\n-------------\n\nNow develop your application and write tests for the features you add.\nRunning your tests for Django works as you would expect::\n\n   $ ./manage.py test\n\nWhat is bundled with Molo?\n--------------------------\n\n1. `Wagtail CMS`_\n2. Basic feature phone template set.\n3. Basic models for the following tree structure:\n\n   1. A site has languages\n   2. A language has a homepage\n   3. Articles are organised into sections.\n   4. Articles are composed from one or more blocks.\n   5. Blocks can be headings, paragraphs, images, lists or\n      links to other pages.\n\nTesting the Molo scaffolding tool\n---------------------------------\n\nIf you're interested in working on or contributing to the code that\ndoes the scaffolding then clone this repository from the GitHub repository at\nhttp://github.com/praekelt/molo.\n\nInstall the requirement development & testing dependencies::\n\n   $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n\nAnd then run the full test suite with::\n\n   $ ./run-tests.sh\n\nPull requests are expected to follow Praekelt's `Ways Of Working`_.\n\n.. _`Ways of Working`: http://ways-of-working.rtfd.org\n.. _`Wagtail CMS`: http://wagtail.io",
