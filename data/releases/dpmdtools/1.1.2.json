    "description": "# DPTools\n**D**eep **P**otential **Tools** (DPTools) provides a command-line interface and python library to simplify training and deploying [DeePMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) machine learning potentials (MLPs), also known as ML force fields. The primary goal of DPTools is to condense workflows for training DP MLPs and running atomistic simulations with [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org)  on HPC systems into a handful of intuitive CLI commands. It is intended for scientists with knowledge of quantum mechanics-based *ab-initio* simulation methods who are interested in effortlessly transitioning to ML-based approaches to greatly increase computational throughput. It requires no prior experience with DeePMD-kit or LAMMPS software, only familiarity with the popular [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) python package is needed.\n\n## Main Features\n\n* Setup deepmd-kit training sets from VASP output or common ASE formats\n* Train ensemble of DP models\n* Generate parity plots to assess accuracy of MLP energy and force predictions\n* Intelligently sample and select new training configurations from DPMD trajectories\n* Easily setup and run different atomistic simulations in LAMMPS:\n\t* Single point energy calculations\n\t* Structure geometry optimizations\n\t* Structure unit cell optimizations\n\t* Molecular dynamics (NVT and NPT ensembles)\n\t* Equations of State and bulk moduli calculations\n\t* Vibratrional/phonon modes using the finite differences approach\n\t* Other common simulation methods available upon request\n* Supports Slurm job submission on HPC systems\n* Setup and run simulations on thousands of structures with a single command\n\n## Documentation\nFor detailed descriptions on setting up and using DPTools, visit the [official documentation](https://dptools.readthedocs.io).\n\n## Quick Install\nThe current stable version (1.0.1) of DPTools can be installed using `pip` with the following command:\n\n~~~\npip install dpmdtools\n~~~\n\nTo verify that the installation was completed successfully, run the command:\n\n~~~\ndptools --version\n~~~\n\n## Support\nIf you are having issues with DPTools, create an issue [here](https://github.com/tysours/DPTools/issues). For more assistance, new feature requests, or general inquiries, feel free to contact Ty at tsours@ucdavis.edu.\n",
