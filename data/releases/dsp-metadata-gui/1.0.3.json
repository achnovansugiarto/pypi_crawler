    "description": "# DSP-METADATA-GUI Metadata Module\n\nThe `dsp-metadata-gui` is a GUI application written in Python for collecting project specific metadata and turn it into RDF.\n\nAs part of the `dsp-tools`, its aim is to enable researchers and project managers who deposit research data on the DSP (DaSCH Service Platform), to add metadata about the project and datasets to the DSP repository. By providing metadata, the project will be searchable on the platform, which is an integral part of the FAIR principles.\n\nThe metadata follows the schema defined by the [dsp-ontologies](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-ontologies).\n\n\n\n## Install and run\n\nThe module provides a command line entry point to run the GUI. The only requirement is Python 3 and PIP installed and ready to use.\n\nThe application has only been tested on Python 3.9, but it might work on older versions too.\n\n__Note:__ There have been issues with `conda` installations. If this is the case, consider using a virtual environment.\n\n\n### Installation via pip\n\nTo install the application, run:\n\n```bash\npip install dsp-metadata-gui\n```\n\nOr respectively:\n\n```shell\npip3 install dsp-metadata-gui\n```\n\nAfterwards, the program can be started by running the command `dsp-metadata` in your terminal of choice.\n\n\n### Installation from source\n\nClone this repo and run `make make-and-run`. If you don't use GNU Make, run the commands specified in the `Makefile` manually.\n\nThis will package the application, install it to your python environment and run the application.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Application is divided into two windows:\n\n1. The main window lets you organize a list of projects, for which you can collect metadata. Several actions can be performed with projects, e.g. editing or exporting the project.\n\n2. When editing a project, in the project window, the actual metadata can be added, modified and saved.\n\nTo add a project, you will need the project short code, which is assigned to you by the DaSCH Client Service.  \nA project is always associated with a folder on your local machine. If any files should be included with the metadata import, these files must be within that folder.\nOnce all metadata are added and valid, and the overall DRF graph of the metadata set validates against the ontology, the project can be exported for upload to the DSP.\n\nAll data is locally stored in the file `~/DaSCH/config/repos.data`. for more detail, see [here](https://dasch-swiss.github.io/dsp-metadata-gui/list_view/#local-data-storage).\n\n\n\n## Development\n\n### Development Environment\n\n#### Pipenv\n\nUse `pipenv` for a seamless development experience.  \nIn order to have both dependencies and dev-dependencies installed from the `Pipfile`, set up the virtual environment running\n```\npipenv instal --dev\n```\n\n`pipenv` will manage dependencies as well as a virtual environment. To install packages, use\n```\npipenv install <package-name>\n```\n\nTo create `requirements.txt`, run \n```\npipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo bring `setup.py` up to date, run\n```\npipenv run pipenv-setup sync\n```\n\n#### GNU Make\n\n`GNU Make` is used to automatize most tasks.  \nRun `make help` for info on the available targets.\n\n__Note:__ All make targets - except `make run` - should be run from within the `pipenv` shell:  \nEither by running\n```\npipenv run make <target-name>\n```\nor by opening a virtual pipenv shell by running\n```\npipenv shell\nmake <target-name>\n...\nexit\n```\n\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe documentation is created using `mkdocs` and `mkdocstrings` with `markdown_include.include`. To create the documentation, make sure to install all of these, using pip.\n\nTo serve the documentation locally, run `make doc`. To deploy the documentation to github pages, run `make deploy-doc`.\n\n\n\n\n",
