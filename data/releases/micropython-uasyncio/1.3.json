    "description": "uasyncio\n========\n\nuasyncio is MicroPython's asynchronous sheduling library, roughly\nmodeled after CPython's asyncio.\n\nuasyncio doesn't use naive always-iterating scheduling algorithm,\nbut performs a real time-based scheduling, which allows it (and\nthus the whole system) to sleep when there is nothing to do (actual\nimplementation of that depends on I/O scheduling algorithm which\nactually performs the wait operation).\n\nMajor conceptual differences to asyncio:\n\n* Avoids defining a notion of Future, and especially wrapping coroutines\n  in Futures, like CPython asyncio does. uasyncio works directly with\n  coroutines (and callbacks).\n* Methods provided are more consistently coroutines.\n* uasyncio uses wrap-around millisecond timebase (as native to all\n  MicroPython ports.)\n* Instead of single large package, number of subpackages are provided\n  (each installable separately).\n\nSpecific differences:\n\n* For millisecond scheduling, ``loop.call_later_ms()`` and\n  ``uasyncio.sleep_ms()`` are provided.\n* As there's no monotonic time, ``loop.call_at()`` is not provided.\n  Instead, there's ``loop.call_at_()`` which is considered an internal\n  function and has slightly different signature.\n* ``call_*`` funcions don't return Handle and callbacks scheduled by\n  them aren't cancellable. If they need to be cancellable, they should\n  accept an object as an argument, and a \"cancel\" flag should be set\n  in the object, for a callback to test.\n* ``Future`` object is not available.\n* ``ensure_future()`` and ``Task()`` perform just scheduling operations\n  and return a native coroutine, not Future/Task objects.\n* Some other functions are not (yet) implemented.\n* StreamWriter method(s) are coroutines. While in CPython asyncio,\n  StreamWriter.write() is a normal function (which potentially buffers\n  unlimited amount of data), uasyncio offers coroutine StreamWriter.awrite()\n  instead. Also, both StreamReader and StreamWriter have .aclose()\n  coroutine method.\n",
