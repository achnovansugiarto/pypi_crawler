Add 'jfu' to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your project `settings.py` file.\n3. Add 'django.core.context_processors.request' and 'django.core.context_processors.static' to `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` in settings.py.\n4. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nDjango-JFU provides simple customizable template tags and override-able\ntemplates that do the work of integrating the jQuery File Upload CSS and\nJavaScipt and the HTML implementation found in the jQuery File Upload demo.\n\nTo place the jQuery File Upload widget in a template, simply insert the\nfollowing within it::\n    \n    {% load jfutags %}\n    {% jfu %}\n\nThen create a view that will handle the uploaded files. By default, the\nURL for the view must be named **'jfu_upload'**.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\nIn your `urls.py` file::\n\n    ...\n    url( r'upload/', views.upload, name = 'jfu_upload' ),\n\n    # You may optionally define a delete url as well\n    url( r'^delete/(?P<pk>\\d+)$', views.upload_delete, name = 'jfu_delete' ),\n\nIn your `views.py` file::\n\n    import os\n    from django.conf import settings\n    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\n    from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST\n    from jfu.http import upload_receive, UploadResponse, JFUResponse\n\n    from YourApp.models import YourUploadModel\n\n    @require_POST\n    def upload( request ):\n\n        # The assumption here is that jQuery File Upload \n        # has been configured to send files one at a time.\n        # If multiple files can be uploaded simulatenously,\n        # 'file' may be a list of files.\n\n        file = upload_receive( request )\n\n        instance = YourUploadModel( file_field = file )\n        instance.save()\n        \n        basename = os.path.basename( instance.file_field.file.name )\n        file_dict = {\n            'name' : basename,\n            'size' : instance.file_field.file.size,\n\n            # The assumption is that file_field is a FileField that saves to\n            # the 'media' directory.\n            'url': settings.MEDIA_URL + basename,\n            'thumbnail_url': settings.MEDIA_URL + basename,\n\n\n            'delete_url': reverse('jfu_delete', kwargs = { 'pk': instance.pk }),\n            'delete_type': 'POST',\n        }\n\n        return UploadResponse( request, file_dict )\n\n    @require_POST\n    def upload_delete( request, pk ):\n        # An example implementation.\n        success = True\n        try:\n            instance = YourUploadModel.objects.get( pk = pk )\n            os.unlink( instance.file_field.file.name )\n            instance.delete()\n        except YourUploadModel.DoesNotExist:\n            success = False\n\n        return JFUResponse( request, success )\n\n\nCustomization\n-------------\n\nDjango-JFU is designed to be very customizable.  \n\nThe Django-JFU template tag optionally takes two arguments: the name of the\ntemplate to load and the name of the URL pointing to the upload-handling\nview.::\n\n    {% load jfutags %}\n    {% jfu 'your_fileuploader.html' 'your_uploader' %}\n\nA custom template can extend from the master Django-JFU template\n`jfu/upload_form.html`.  There are several blocks which may be overriden for\nthe purpose of customization:\n\n* JS_OPTS - The options supplied to the jQuery File Upload `fileupload` function. \n* JS_INIT - The initializing JavaScript\n* JS_FORM - Loads existing files.\n* FILE_INPUT - The file input for the upload form.\n\nThe blocks above are most-likely what you will want to override when seeking to\ncustomize. For instance, one would go about adding a few options to the\nfileupload function in this manner::\n\n    # your_fileuploader.html\n    {% extends 'jfu/upload_form.html' %}\n    \n    {% block JS_OPTS %}\n    autoUpload: true,\n    maxNumberOfFiles: 5,\n    sequentialUploads: true,\n    {% endblock %}\n\nThere are several other blocks too:\n\n\nHTML Components\n===============\n\n* MODAL_GALLERY - The modal gallery\n* UPLOAD_FORM   - The file upload form used as target for the file upload widget.\n\n  * UPLOAD_FORM_LISTING - The table listing the files available for upload/download.\n  * UPLOAD_FORM_LINDICATOR - The loading indicator shown during file processing.\n  * UPLOAD_FORM_PROGRESS_BAR - The global progress information.\n  * UPLOAD_FORM_BUTTON_BAR - The fileupload-buttonbar contains buttons to add/delete files and start/cancel the upload.\n\n    * UPLOAD_FORM_BUTTON_BAR_CONTROL \n    * UPLOAD_FORM_BUTTON_BAR_ADD \n\nCSS Components\n==============\n\n* CSS\n\n  * CSS_BOOTSTRAP \n  * CSS_BOOTSTRAP_IE6\n  * CSS_BLUEIMP_GALLERY \n  * CSS_JQUERY_FILE_UPLOAD_UI\n  * CSS_HTML5_SHIM \n\nJS Components\n=============\n\n* JS_TEMPLATES \n\n  * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE \n\n    * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE_DELETE \n    * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE_DOWNLOAD  \n    * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE_PREVIEW \n    * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE_ERROR \n    * JS_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE_FSIZE \n\n  * JS_UPLOAD_TEMPLATE \n\n* JS_SCRIPTS    \n\n  * JS_JQUERY \n  * JS_JQUERY_UI_WIDGET\n  * JS_TEMPLATES_PLUGIN\n  * JS_LOAD_IMAGE\n  * JS_CANVAS_TO_BLOB \n  * JS_BOOTSTRAP \n  * JS_BLUEIMP_GALLERY \n  * JS_BOOTSTRAP_IFRAME_TRANSPORT\n  * JS_JQUERY_FILE_UPLOAD\n  * JS_JQUERY_FILE_UPLOAD_FP\n  * JS_JQUERY_FILEUPLOAD_UI \n  * JS_XDR_TRANSPORT \n\nThe included JavaScript and CSS can be updated or suppressed by overriding\nthese blocks ::\n\n    # your_fileuploader.html\n    {% extends 'jfu/upload_form.html' %}\n\n    {% block JS_JQUERY %}\n        <script src={{STATIC_URL}}/js/my.newer.jquery.js />\n    {% endblock %}\n\n    {% block CSS_BOOTSTRAP %}\n        {% comment %}\n        This is already included.\n        {% endcomment %}\n    {% endblock %}\n\nDemo\n----\nIf you have downloaded from the repository, a simple demo application has been\nincluded in the 'demo' directory. To test it out, run ::\n\n        ./setup && ./run\n\nContribution\n------------           \nDjango-JFU is wholly open source and welcomes contributions of any kind.
