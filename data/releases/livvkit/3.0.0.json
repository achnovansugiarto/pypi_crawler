    "description": "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/imgs/livvkit.png)\n\n  The land ice verification and validation toolkit\n===============================================================================\n\nLIVVkit is a python-based toolkit for verification and validation of ice sheet\nmodels. It aims to provide the following capabilities:\n\n**Model V&V**\n* Numerical verification -- \"Are we solving the equations correctly?\"\n* Physical validation -- \"Are we using the right physics?\"\n\n**Software V&V**\n* Code verification -- \"did we build what *we* intended?\"\n* Performance validation -- \"did we build what the *users* wanted?\"\n\nWithin LIVVkit, these capabilities are broken into four components:\n\nModel V&V\n* Numerics\n* Validation\n\nSoftware V&V\n* Verification\n* Performance\n\nCurrently, LIVVkit is being used and developed in conjunction with E3SM\n([Energy Exascale Earth System Model](https://e3sm.org/)) and CISM\n([Community Ice Sheet Model](https://cism.github.io/)), but is designed\nto be extensible to other models. For further documentation view the\n[full documentation](https://livvkit.github.io/Docs).\n\n**Users and contributors are welcome!** We’ll help you out –\n[open an issue on github](https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues)\nto contact us for any reason.\n\n  Installation \n================\nThe latest LIVVkit release can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n\n```sh\npip install livvkit\n```\n\nAdditionally, LIVVkit is released on github, and you can clone the source code:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit.git\n```\n\nIf you are having any troubles with installation or dependencies, open an issue on the \n[issue tracker](https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues) or contact us!\n\n\n  Usage\n==========\nLIVVkit is primarily controlled via options specified at the command line.\nTo see the full list of options, run:\n\n```sh\nlivv -h\n```\n\n Verification\n--------------\n\nIn verification mode, LIVVkit analyzes and compares a regression testing\ndataset to a reference dataset. For example, LIVVkit may analyze the dataset\nproduced from a proposed CISM 2.0.6 release (~400MB; download\n[here](http://jhkennedy.org/LIVVkit/cism-2.0.6-tests.20160728.tgz)) and\ncompare it to the dataset produced from the CISM 2.0.0 release (~400MB;\ndownload [here](http://jhkennedy.org/LIVVkit/cism-2.0.0-tests.20160728.tgz)).\nTo run this example, first download the two aforementioned datasets to a\ndirectory, open a terminal, and navigate to your download directory.\nThen, un-tar the datasets:\n\n```sh\ntar -zxvf cism-2.0.0-tests.20160728.tgz\ntar -zxvf cism-2.0.6-tests.20160728.tgz\n```\n\nFor ease, export the path to the two dataset directories:\n\n```sh\nexport REF=$PWD/cism-2.0.0-tests/titan-gnu/CISM_glissade\nexport TEST=$PWD/cism-2.0.6-tests/titan-gnu/CISM_glissade\n```\n\nTo run the suite, use:\n\n```sh\nlivv -v $TEST $REF -o cism206v200 -s\n```\n\nLIVVkit will run the verification suite, report a summary of the results\non the command line, produce an output website in the created `cism206v200`\ndirectory specified by the `-o/--out-dir` option, and launch an http server\n(the `-s/--serve option`) to easily view the output in your favorite web\nbrowser. LIVVkit will tell you the address to view the website at on the\ncommand line, which will typically look like\nhttp://0.0.0.0:8000/ver_test/index.html.\n\n\n Validation, Extensions\n-----------------------\n\nLIVVkit is extensible to more in-depth or larger validation analyses.\nHowever, because these validation analyses are particularly data intensive,\nmany of the observational and example model output files are much too\nlarge to distribute in the LIVVkit package. Therefore, we've developed a\nLIVVkit Extensions repository (LEX) which uses\n[git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com) (Git Large File Support) in order to\ndistribute the required data. `git-lfs` can be installed either before or\nafter cloning this repository, but it will be needed *before* downloading\nthe required data. You can determine if you have `git-lfs` installed on\nyour system by running this command:\n\n```sh\ncommand -v git-lfs\n```\n\nIf `git-lfs` is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions here:\n\nhttps://git-lfs.github.com\n\nOnce `git-lfs` is installed, clone and enter this repository:\n\n```sh\ngit lfs clone https://code.ornl.gov/LIVVkit/lex.git\ncd lex\n```\n\nEach extension will have an associated JSON configuration file which will describe\nthe extension's analysis code, data locations, and options. To see a list of\navailable extensions, you can run this command:\n\n```sh\nfind . -iname \"*.json\"\n```\n\nTo execute any of these extensions, point `livv`\nto any of these extensions config file via the `-e/--extension` option (or the\n`-V/--validate` option). For example, to run the minimal example extension,\nplace the output website in the `val_test` directory, and serve the output website\nyou'd run this command:\n\n```sh\nlivv -e example/example.json -o vv_test -s\n```\n\n*Note:* All the extension configurations files assume you are working from the\ntop level `lex` directory. You *can* run any of these extensions from any\ndirectory, but you will need to edit the paths in the JSON configuration files so\nthat `livv` can find the required files.\n\nLikewise, you can also apply these analyses to any new model run by adjusting\nthe paths to point to your model run.\n\n\n More\n------\n\nFor more information about using LIVVkit see the [documentation](https://livvkit.github.io/Docs).\n\n  Contact\n===========\n\nIf you would like to suggest features, request tests, discuss contributions,\nreport bugs, ask questions, or contact us for any reason, use the\n[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues).\n\nWant to send us a private message?\n\n**Joseph H.
