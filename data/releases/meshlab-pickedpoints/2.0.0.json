Later it was extracted\nfrom the Body Labs codebase and open-sourced by [Guillaume Marceau][]. In\n2018 it was [forked by Paul Melnikow][fork] and published as\n[metabolace][fork pypi]. Thanks to a repository and package transfer from\nBody Labs, the fork has been merged back into the original.\n\n[lace]: http://github.com/lace/lace\n[paul melnikow]: https://github.com/paulmelnikow\n[jake beard]: https://github.com/jbeard4\n[alex weiss]: https://github.com/algrs\n[eric rachlin]: https://github.com/eerac\n[victor alvarez]: https://github.com/yangmillstheory\n[guillaume marceau]: https://github.com/gmarceau\n[fork]: https://github.com/metabolize/lace\n[fork pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/metabolace/\n\n## License\n\nThe project is licensed under the two-clause BSD license.\n\n\n",
