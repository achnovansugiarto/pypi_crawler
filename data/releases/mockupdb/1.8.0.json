    "description": "========\nMockupDB\n========\n\nMock server for testing MongoDB clients and creating MongoDB Wire Protocol\nservers.\n\n* Documentation: http://mockupdb.readthedocs.org/\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nNext Release\n------------\n\nMockupDB supports Python 3.4 through 3.8; it no longer supports Python 2.6 or\nPython 3.3.\n\nNew method ``MockupDB.append_responder`` to add an autoresponder of last resort.\n\nFix a bug in ``interactive_server`` with ``all_ok=True``. It had returned an\nempty isMaster response, causing drivers to throw errors like \"Server at\nlocalhost:27017 reports wire version 0, but this version of PyMongo requires at\nleast 2 (MongoDB 2.6).\"\n\nStop logging \"OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something\nthat is not a socket\" on Windows after a client disconnects.\n\nParse OP_MSGs with any number of sections in any order. This allows write\ncommands from the mongo shell, which sends sections in the opposite order from\ndrivers. Handle OP_MSGs with checksums, such as those sent by the mongo shell\nbeginning in 4.2.\n\n1.7.0 (2018-12-02)\n------------------\n\nImprove datetime support in match expressions. Python datetimes have microsecond\nprecision but BSON only has milliseconds, so expressions like this always\nfailed::\n\n  server.receives(Command('foo', when=datetime(2018, 12, 1, 6, 6, 6, 12345)))\n\nNow, the matching logic has been rewritten to recurse through arrays and\nsubdocuments, comparing them value by value. It compares datetime values with\nonly millisecond precision.\n\n1.6.0 (2018-11-16)\n------------------\n\nRemove vendored BSON library. Instead, require PyMongo and use its BSON library.\nThis avoids surprising problems where a BSON type created with PyMongo does not\nappear equal to one created with MockupDB, and it avoids the occasional need to\nupdate the vendored code to support new BSON features.\n\n1.5.0 (2018-11-02)\n------------------\n\nSupport for Unix domain paths with ``uds_path`` parameter.\n\nThe ``interactive_server()`` function now prepares the server to autorespond to\nthe ``getFreeMonitoringStatus`` command from the mongo shell.\n\n1.4.1 (2018-06-30)\n------------------\n\nFix an inadvertent dependency on PyMongo, which broke the docs build.\n\n1.4.0 (2018-06-29)\n------------------\n\nSupport, and expect, OP_MSG requests from clients. Thanks to Shane Harvey for\nthe contribution.\n\nUpdate vendored bson library from PyMongo. Support the Decimal128 BSON type. Fix\nMatcher so it equates BSON objects from PyMongo like ``ObjectId(...)`` with\nequivalent objects created from MockupDB's vendored bson library.\n\n1.3.0 (2018-02-19)\n------------------\n\nSupport Windows. Log a traceback if a bad client request causes an assert. Fix\nSSL. Make errors less likely on shutdown. Enable testing on Travis and Appveyor.\nFix doctests and interactive server for modern MongoDB protocol.\n\n1.2.1 (2017-12-06)\n------------------\n\nSet minWireVersion to 0, not to 2. I had been wrong about MongoDB 3.6's wire\nversion range: it's actually 0 to 6. MockupDB now reports the same wire version\nrange as MongoDB 3.6 by default.\n\n1.2.0 (2017-09-22)\n------------------\n\nUpdate for MongoDB 3.6: report minWireVersion 2 and maxWireVersion 6 by default.\n\n1.1.3 (2017-04-23)\n------------------\n\nAvoid rare RuntimeError in close(), if a client thread shuts down a socket as\nMockupDB iterates its list of sockets.\n\n1.1.2 (2016-08-23)\n------------------\n\nProperly detect closed sockets so ``MockupDB.stop()`` doesn't take 10 seconds\nper connection. Thanks to Sean Purcell.\n\n1.1.1 (2016-08-01)\n------------------\n\nDon't use \"client\" as a keyword arg for ``Request``, it conflicts with the\nactual \"client\" field in drivers' new handshake protocol.\n\n1.1.0 (2016-02-11)\n------------------\n\nAdd cursor_id property to OpGetMore, and ssl parameter to interactive_server.\n\n1.0.3 (2015-09-12)\n------------------\n\n``MockupDB(auto_ismaster=True)`` had just responded ``{\"ok\": 1}``, but this\nisn't enough to convince PyMongo 3 it's talking to a valid standalone,\nso auto-respond ``{\"ok\": 1, \"ismaster\": True}``.\n\n1.0.2 (2015-09-11)\n------------------\n\nRestore Request.assert_matches method, used in pymongo-mockup-tests.\n\n1.0.1 (2015-09-11)\n------------------\n\nAllow co-installation with PyMongo.\n\n1.0.0 (2015-09-10)\n------------------\n\nFirst release.\n\n0.1.0 (2015-02-25)\n------------------\n\nDevelopment begun.\n",
