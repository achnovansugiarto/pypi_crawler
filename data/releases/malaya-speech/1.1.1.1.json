    "description": "**Malaya-Speech** is a Speech-Toolkit library for bahasa Malaysia, powered by Deep Learning Tensorflow.\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nProper documentation is available at https://malaya-speech.readthedocs.io/\n\nInstalling from the PyPI\n----------------------------------\n\nCPU version\n::\n\n    $ pip install malaya-speech\n\nGPU version\n::\n\n    $ pip install malaya-speech-gpu\n\nOnly **Python 3.6.0 and above** and **Tensorflow 1.15.0 and above** are supported.\n\nWe recommend to use **virtualenv** for development. All examples tested on Tensorflow version 1.15.4 and 2.4.1.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n-  **Age Detection**, detect age in speech using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Speaker Diarization**, diarizing speakers using Pretrained Speaker Vector.\n-  **Emotion Detection**, detect emotions in speech using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Gender Detection**, detect genders in speech using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Language Detection**, detect hyperlocal languages in speech using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Multispeaker Separation**, Multispeaker separation using FastSep on 8k Wav.\n-  **Noise Reduction**, reduce multilevel noises using STFT UNET.\n-  **Speaker Change**, detect changing speakers using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Speaker overlap**, detect overlap speakers using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Speaker Vector**, calculate similarity between speakers using Pretrained Speaker Vector.\n-  **Speech Enhancement**, enhance voice activities using Waveform UNET.\n-  **SpeechSplit Conversion**, detailed speaking style conversion by disentangling speech into content, timbre, rhythm and pitch using PyWorld and PySPTK.\n-  **Speech-to-Text**, End-to-End Speech to Text for Malay and Mixed (Malay and Singlish) using RNN-Transducer and Wav2Vec2 CTC.\n-  **Super Resolution**, Super Resolution 4x for Waveform.\n-  **Text-to-Speech**, Text to Speech for Malay and Singlish using Tacotron2 and FastSpeech2.\n-  **Vocoder**, convert Mel to Waveform using MelGAN, Multiband MelGAN and Universal MelGAN Vocoder.\n-  **Voice Activity Detection**, detect voice activities using Finetuned Speaker Vector.\n-  **Voice Conversion**, Many-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, and Zero-shot Voice Conversion.\n-  **Hybrid 8-bit Quantization**, provide hybrid 8-bit quantization for all models to reduce inference time up to 2x and model size up to 4x.\n\nPretrained Models\n------------------\n\nMalaya-Speech also released pretrained models, simply check at
