    "description": "# PURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of this software is to measure the access delay of a push-to-talk (PTT) network.\nAccess time generally describes time associated with the initialization and assignment\nof channels upon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component of\nquality of experience (QoE) in communications. NISTâ€™s PSCR division developed a method\nto measure and quantify the access time of any PTT communication system.\n\n# OBTAINING SOFTWARE\n\n- Access Time measurement software available at:  https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime\n- Microcontroller firmware available at:  https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QoE-firmware\n- MCV QoE GUI software available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe\n- Core MCV QoE library available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base\n\n# OBTAINING PAPERS\n\n- Start-of-word correction paper available at: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2166\n- Addendum Paper available at: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8328\n- Orignal measurement system paper available at: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8275\n\n# OBTAINING DATA\n- Start-of-word correction data available at: https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2411\n- Addendum measurement data available at: https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2356\n- Original measurement system data available at:  https://doi.org/10.18434/M32083\n\n# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\n- 1 computer able to run Python 3.9 or newer\n- 1 audio interface\n- 2 push-to-talk communications devices for testing\n- QoE hardware\n- cables to connect test devices to QoE hardware\n- Audio cables to connect QoE hardware to audio interface\n\n# RUNNING MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE\n\nThe easiest way to use the measurement system is to run the GUI (https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe).\n\n# Post Processing\n\n# Calculating Access Time and Uncertainty\n\nIf access time is run through the GUI, the user will be guided through the \nprocess of calculating access time. Using the GUI is the recomended way, but it\ncan also be done by running the following python code:\n\n```\neval_obj = mcvqoe.accesstime.evaluate(filepaths)\nmean, ci = eval_obj.eval(alpha=0.9)\n```\n\nWhere `filepaths` is a list that contains the path to the .csv files from the \ntest to evaluate.\n\n# Microcontroller Code\nThe code, as well as additional instructions, for the radio interface microcontroller is located:  <https://doi.org/10.18434/M32086>. \n\nThis code was designed to run on the MSP-EXP430F5529LP \"Launch Pad\" development board and compiled for the MSP430 using TI Code Composer Studio. The microcontroller code sets up a virtual COM port over USB and provides a simple command line interface. This code is compatible with the modifications attached via perfboard.\n\nThe code uses the standard TI USB library and serial drivers. On Windows 10 driver installation is not necessary. On other systems the appropriate driver may need to be downloaded from TI.\n\n# TECHNICAL SUPPORT\nFor more information or assistance on access delay measurements please contact:\n\nPublic Safety Communications Research Division\\\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\\\n325 Broadway\\\nBoulder, CO 80305\\\nPSCR@PSCR.gov\n\n# DISCLAIMER\n**Much of the included software was developed by NIST employees, for that software the following disclaimer applies:**\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
