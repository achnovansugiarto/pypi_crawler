    "description": "==================\ndjango CMS History\n==================\n\n\n|pypi| |build| |coverage|\n\n**django CMS History** is an addon application to provide undo/redo functionality in `django CMS\n<https://django-cms.org/>`_, by maintaining content history.\n\nSome of the functionality in this application was previously included in django CMS itself. However, it became apparent\nthat some users did not want it, and some wanted functionality that worked differently.\n\nIn keeping with the django CMS philosophy of maintaining only core CMS functionality as part of the package itself,\nhistory management was removed from django CMS in version 3.4 and has been spun off into an independent application.\n\ndjango CMS History has been rewritten from the ground up. It will continue to be developed. New functionality and\nimprovements will be introduced in future releases.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThis is a an open-source project. We'll be delighted to receive your\nfeedback in the form of issues and pull requests. Before submitting your\npull request, please review our `contribution guidelines\n<http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSee ``REQUIREMENTS`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-history/blob/master/setup.py>`_\nfile for additional dependencies:\n\n* Python 2.7, 3.4 or higher\n* Django 1.11 or higher\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor a manual install:\n\n* run ``pip install djangocms-history``\n* add ``djangocms_history`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n* run ``python manage.py migrate djangocms_history``\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nOnce installed, django CMS History will make new options available to the web content manager. These will be visible in\nthe django CMS toolbar when managing content that is supported by the application.\n\n\nRunning Tests\n-------------\n\nYou can run tests by executing:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    virtualenv env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n    python setup.py test\n\n\n.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-history.svg\n    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-history\n.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-history.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-history\n.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-history/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-history\n",
