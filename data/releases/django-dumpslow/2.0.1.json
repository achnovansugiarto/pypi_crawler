    "description": "From: http://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/django-dumpslow/\n\ndjango-dumpslow is a reusable Django application that logs requests that take a\nlong time to execute and provides an tool to summarise the resulting data.\n\nModelled on mysqldumpslow, django-dumpslow is intended as a tool to determine\nwhich parts of a project might benefit most from optimisation and to provide\nvaluable empirical data.\n\nThe tool groups requests that are similar by exploiting Django's ability to\nreverse URLs - requests that that use the same view should not counted\ndistinctly. Views can then be grouped by the total accumulated time spent by\nthat view or simply by their raw frequency in the logs.\n\nAdditionally, if the log entries contain timestamps then django-dumpslow can\nlimit queries by a user-defined interval. This can be useful for generating\nregular reports of slow pages, perhaps by regularly emailing them to a\ndevelopment list.\n\nData is stored in Redis to allow easy collation of data from multiple front-end\nservers (django-dumpslow requires the Redis Python client library).\n\nAn example output is:\n\n  $ ./manage.py dumpslow\n  View                                Accumulated time\n  =====================================================\n  example.views.slow                             92.88\n  /unknown (unreversible url)                    16.84\n\ndjango-dumpslow ships with an example project that demonstrates its\nfunctionality.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n1. Get Dedis working in django, it's required. You'll need a redis server\n   running and REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT set in settings.py\n\n2. Add the following to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py::\n  \n     'django_dumpslow'\n\n3. Add the following to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py::\n\n    'django_dumpslow.middleware.LogLongRequestMiddleware'\n\nLicense\n-------\n\ndjango-dumpslow is released under the BSD license.\n",
