    "description": "Introduction\n============\nThis project aims to provide a different approach to traditional log tailers.\nAmongst other features:\n\n* Multitailing capability. It can tail multiple logs at a time\n* Colors for every level: warn, info, debug, error and fatal\n* Emphasize multiple targets (log traces) given regular expressions\n* Follow log upon truncation by default\n* User defined colors for each level\n* Silent (daemonized) mode\n* Throttling mode. Slow down the information being printed in the terminal\n* Inactivity log monitoring\n* mail notification\n* Pause Modes freezes output for a limited period of time depending on level found.\n* Analytics. Makes a report of each level found in logs when finished. \n\nWhy yet another tailer?\n=======================\nMost people use tail -F to tail the logs these days. When debugging enterprise\nclass applications you cannot just follow (in many situations) what is going on\nunless you go to the log, less it and check if something was wrong, or just\nCtrl-C tail program and scroll back. Human eye cannot distinguish or grab a\nline out of thousands when that information is showed incredibly fast in the\nscreen. By providing colors, the human eye will discern and quickly identify\nspecific levels or lines.",
