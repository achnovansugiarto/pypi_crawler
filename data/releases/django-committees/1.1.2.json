The rest of the governing is done via committees, wether standing or ad-hoc. The whole government is governed by bylaws and policies. This app should organize all these elements in one place for reference.\n\nModels\n--------\n\nTERM_LIMIT=2\n\nBoardOffice (Pres, vp, sec, at-large, alternate, ex-officio...)\n  - title\n  - slug\n  - description\n  - officer?\n  - officer_rank (INT)\n\nBoardTerm\n  - start_date\n  - end_date\n  - office (Office)\n\nBoardMember\n  - Person (Profile)\n  - Term (BoardTerm)\n\nMeeting \n  - Event\n  - Minutes\n  - Members (BoardMember)\n  - Guests (VarChar)\n  - Adjourn\n  \nBoardMeeting (Meeting)\n  - Agenda\n \nMinutes\n  - Meeting\n  - Draft?\n  - Content\n  - Attachment\n\nCommitteeMember\n  - Person\n\nCommittee\n  - title\n  - description\n  - chairs\n  - members (CommitteeMember)\n  - reports\n\nCommitteeTerm\n  - start_date\n  - end_date\n  - committee\n\nReport\n  - Date\n  - Content\n  - Author (Person)\n\nURLs\n-------\n\nJust an example hook up spot:\n\nview: index = government/ - index to show gov. board, committees, latest meetings/minutes\nview: board_detail = government/board/ - detail of board make-up, past boards and minutes/meetings\nview: board_meeting_detail = government/meetings/<year>/<month>/ - detail of a meeting with minutes, members, etc.\nview: committee_list = government/committees/ - list of all committees and membership\nview: committee_detail = government/committees/<slug> - detail of one committee\nview: report_list = government/reports/<year>/<month>/<committee_slug> \nview: meeting_list = government/meetings/ - list of all meetings in the system",
