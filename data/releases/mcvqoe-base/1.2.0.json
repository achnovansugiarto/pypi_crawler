    "description": "# mcvqoe Python Package\n\nCommon code for MCV QoE Measurement Methods. This package contains core code for \nQoE measurements used in the following packages:\n\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mouth2ear>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/psud>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/intelligibility>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QOE-TVO>\n\nThe `mcvqoe-base` package includes libraries to play audio through a Push To \nTalk (PTT) communication system. Also included are equivalent libraries to \nsimulate sending audio through a PTT communication system.\n\n# Installing the Package\nTo install the package run\n```\npip install mcvqoe-base\n```\n\nAlternatively, to build and install the package, clone this repository and run the following\nfrom the root of the git repository :\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n# Radio Interface Firmware\n\nThe firmware for the RadioInterface board can be found at:\n\n<https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QoE-firmware>\n\n# Measurement Data Structure\n\nFor more information about how measurement data gets stored see the [Data Structure Readme](DataStructure.md).\n\n# License\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
