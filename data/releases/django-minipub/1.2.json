In the admin interface, Minipub will add this fieldset:\n\n.. image:: docs/img/minipub-fieldset.png\n\nAll articles will then have the following 3 fields:\n\n- status: usually ``draft`` or ``published``.\n- start: start date.\n- end: end date; optional.\n\nArticles will only be visible in the public website **if** they are ``published``\n**and** today's date is between the start and end dates.\n\nIn addition, we have a fieldset for showing various read-only status fields:\n\n.. image:: docs/img/minipub-status-fieldset.png\n\nThese can be of use for tracking changes to an Article.\n\nAnd that's it... Minipub is simply a few fields on a Model Mixin, together with plenty of code - in the models,\nviews, admin and sitemap - to make the best use of it, that you will hopefully reuse \nagain and again throughout a project.\n\nWhat can I use it for?\n----------------------\nHere are some examples of Minipub at work:\n\n- `Controlling the publication of the Events for a F1 racetrack <http://www.silverstone.co.uk/events/>`_.\n- `Controlling when job offers are displayed <http://www.ipglobal-ltd.com/en/about/careers/>`_.\n- `Minutes of the meetings of a residents association website <http://www.saphra.org.uk/meetings/>`_.\n\nAlternatives\n------------\nThere are several similar projects that take slightly different approaches \nto publication control; usually they introduce more sophisticated control. A well-known\nexample is `django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>`_.\n\nMinipub is a very basic publication control tool, but works well on several production \nwebsites. Its author has found it be a decent compromise between a tool that's too\nbasic to be useful, and too complex to be understood by its intended end users.\n\nInstallation and usage\n----------------------\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/django-minipub/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: http://django-minipub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status\nPlease take a look at\n`the documentation <http://django-minipub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ on ReadTheDocs.",
