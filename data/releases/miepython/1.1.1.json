    "description": "When a plane wave encounters a perfect sphere then some of the light will\n\tbe absorbed and some will be scattered.  Mie developed the equations that\n\tdescribe the scattered light wave.  These equations are complicated and \n\tinvolve infinite sums of Bessel functions.  Not surprisingly, calculating\n\tthe scattered profiles is complicated and easily gotten wrong.  Fortunately\n\tWiscombe identified the challenges and implemented these in Fortran code.\n\t\n\tThis code is pure python and uses many of the ideas that Wiscombe developed.\n\tHowever, it is *not* as accurate (especially for large spheres with size parameters\n\tlarger than 100).\n\t\n\tThis code provides python functions for calculating the extinction efficiency,\n\tscattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry.  Moreover, a\n\tset of angles can be given and the scattering will be calculated for each angle.",
