Imagine you are building a task management app, and \nthe UI allows a user to manually sort his or her daily tasks via drag-and-drop. Django Subjective Sort makes it easy to \nhandle re-positioning, both of the task that moved but also the other tasks that were affected by the move.\n\n## How it works\n\nAn abstract Django model class establishes an integer field named `position` for storing the position of an object in a \nlist. Objects have no position by default (e.g. `position = None`). Positioning is one-indexed with the object assigned \nthe `1` position having the highest prominence and objects without a position the lowest prominence. Objects cannot have\na position less than one, and cannot have a position greater than the number of objects in the list. If an object is \nassigned a position greater than the number of objects with an assigned position, list objects without a position will\ninherit one until the desired list position is reached.\n\n**Important: Never modify the value of the `position` field directly. Only manage object positioning using the\n`reposition` method.**\n\nBy design, Django Subjective Sort cannot influence list membership. It's only responsibility is managing the positioning\nof objects in the list it is provided. Since only a single position value is stored, each object can belong to only one\nsubjectively sortable list. Using the task management example above, a task could be manually sorted among peers \nassigned to the same day, but not also among peers assigned to the same week or month.\n\nBoth for flexibility and because the Sortable model class is abstract, positioning changes are not automatically saved. \nThe example below demonstrates how to extend the `reposition` method to save positioning changes for all objects \naffected by re-positioning in a single transaction.\n\nThe Sortable model class contains two methods: `reposition` and `sort_by_position`. The `reposition` method updates the\nposition of the object it is called on, as well as any of its list peers affected by the change. The `sort_by_position`\nmethod is a convenience method for sorting a list of objects by their position. \n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\n    $ pip install django-subjective-sort\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extend the `Sortable` class to add custom sorting logic to any Django model.\n\n```python\n# food/models.py\nfrom django_subjective_sort.models import Sortable\n\n\nclass Food(Sortable):\n    pass\n\n```\n\n2. Apply migrations.\n\n```shell\n    $ python manage.py makemigrations\n    $ python manage.py migrate\n```\n\n3. Extend the `reposition` method to save positioning changes for all objects affected by re-positioning in a single\ntransaction.\n\n```python\n# food/models.py\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom src.django_subjective_sort.models import Sortable\n\n\nclass Food(Sortable):\n    # Extend the `Sortable` class to save sorting order.\n    # This allows flexibility to save other changes simultaneously.\n    def reposition(self,\n                   peers: List['Food'],\n                   position: int = None) -> List['Food']:\n        sortables_affected = super().reposition(peers, position) + [self]\n        # Save the changes\n        return Food.objects.bulk_update(sortables_affected, ['position'])\n\n```\n",
