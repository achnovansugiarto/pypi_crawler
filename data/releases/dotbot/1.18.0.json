    "description": "# Dotbot [![Build Status](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)\n\nDotbot makes installing your dotfiles as easy as `git clone $url && cd dotfiles\n&& ./install`, even on a freshly installed system!\n\n- [Rationale](#rationale)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n- [Directives](#directives) ([Link](#link), [Create](#create), [Shell](#shell), [Clean](#clean), [Defaults](#defaults))\n- [Plugins](#plugins)\n- [Command-line Arguments](#command-line-arguments)\n- [Wiki][wiki]\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nDotbot is a tool that bootstraps your dotfiles (it's a [Dot]files\n[bo]o[t]strapper, get it?). It does *less* than you think, because version\ncontrol systems do more than you think.\n\nDotbot is designed to be lightweight and self-contained, with no external\ndependencies and no installation required. Dotbot can also be a drop-in\nreplacement for any other tool you were using to manage your dotfiles, and\nDotbot is VCS-agnostic -- it doesn't make any attempt to manage your dotfiles.\n\nIf you want an in-depth tutorial about organizing your dotfiles, see this [blog\npost][managing-dotfiles-post].\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Starting Fresh?\n\nGreat! You can automate the creation of your dotfiles by using the\nuser-contributed [init-dotfiles][init-dotfiles] script. If you'd rather use a\ntemplate repository, check out [dotfiles_template][dotfiles-template]. Or, if\nyou're just looking for [some inspiration][inspiration], we've got you covered.\n\n### Integrate with Existing Dotfiles\n\nThe following will help you get set up using Dotbot in just a few steps.\n\nIf you're using **Git**, you can add Dotbot as a submodule:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.dotfiles # replace with the path to your dotfiles\ngit init # initialize repository if needed\ngit submodule add https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot\ngit config -f .gitmodules submodule.dotbot.ignore dirty # ignore dirty commits in the submodule\ncp dotbot/tools/git-submodule/install .\ntouch install.conf.yaml\n```\n\nIf you're using **Mercurial**, you can add Dotbot as a subrepo:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.dotfiles # replace with the path to your dotfiles\nhg init # initialize repository if needed\necho \"dotbot = [git]https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot\" > .hgsub\nhg add .hgsub\ngit clone https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot\ncp dotbot/tools/hg-subrepo/install .\ntouch install.conf.yaml\n```\n\nTo get started, you just need to fill in the `install.conf.yaml` and Dotbot\nwill take care of the rest. To help you get started we have [an\nexample](#full-example) config file as well as [configuration\ndocumentation](#configuration) for the accepted parameters.\n\nNote: The `install` script is merely a shim that checks out the appropriate\nversion of Dotbot and calls the full Dotbot installer. By default, the script\nassumes that the configuration is located in `install.conf.yaml` the Dotbot\nsubmodule is located in `dotbot`. You can change either of these parameters by\nediting the variables in the `install` script appropriately.\n\nSetting up Dotbot as a submodule or subrepo locks it on the current version.\nYou can upgrade Dotbot at any point. If using a submodule, run `git submodule\nupdate --remote dotbot`, substituting `dotbot` with the path to the Dotbot\nsubmodule; be sure to commit your changes before running `./install`, otherwise\nthe old version of Dotbot will be checked out by the install script. If using a\nsubrepo, run `git fetch && git checkout origin/master` in the Dotbot directory.\n\nIf you prefer, you can install Dotbot from [PyPI] and call it as a command-line\nprogram:\n\n```bash\npip install dotbot\ntouch install.conf.yaml\n```\n\nIn this case, rather than running `./install`, you can invoke Dotbot with\n`dotbot -c <path to configuration file>`.\n\n### Full Example\n\nHere's an example of a complete configuration.\n\nThe conventional name for the configuration file is `install.conf.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\n- defaults:\n    link:\n      relink: true\n\n- clean: ['~']\n\n- link:\n    ~/.tmux.conf: tmux.conf\n    ~/.vim: vim\n    ~/.vimrc: vimrc\n\n- create:\n    - ~/downloads\n    - ~/.vim/undo-history\n\n- shell:\n  - [git submodule update --init --recursive, Installing submodules]\n```\n\nThe configuration file is typically written in YAML, but it can also be written\nin JSON (which is a [subset of YAML][json2yaml]). JSON configuration files are\nconventionally named `install.conf.json`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nDotbot uses YAML or JSON-formatted configuration files to let you specify how\nto set up your dotfiles. Currently, Dotbot knows how to [link](#link) files and\nfolders, [create](#create) folders, execute [shell](#shell) commands, and\n[clean](#clean) directories of broken symbolic links. Dotbot also supports user\n[plugins](#plugins) for custom commands.\n\n**Ideally, bootstrap configurations should be idempotent. That is, the\ninstaller should be able to be run multiple times without causing any\nproblems.** This makes a lot of things easier to do (in particular, syncing\nupdates between machines becomes really easy).\n\nDotbot configuration files are arrays of tasks, where each task\nis a dictionary that contains a command name mapping to data for that command.\nTasks are run in the order in which they are specified. Commands within a task\ndo not have a defined ordering.\n\nWhen writing nested constructs, keep in mind that YAML is whitespace-sensitive.\nFollowing the formatting used in the examples is a good idea. If a YAML\nconfiguration file is not behaving as you expect, try inspecting the\n[equivalent JSON][json2yaml] and check that it is correct.\n\n## Directives\n\nMost Dotbot commands support both a simplified and extended syntax, and they\ncan also be configured via setting [defaults](#defaults).\n\n### Link\n\nLink commands specify how files and directories should be symbolically linked.\nIf desired, items can be specified to be forcibly linked, overwriting existing\nfiles if necessary. Environment variables in paths are automatically expanded.\n\n#### Format\n\nLink commands are specified as a dictionary mapping targets to source\nlocations. Source locations are specified relative to the base directory (that\nis specified when running the installer). If linking directories, *do not*\ninclude a trailing slash.\n\nLink commands support an optional extended configuration. In this type of\nconfiguration, instead of specifying source locations directly, targets are\nmapped to extended configuration dictionaries.\n\n| Parameter | Explanation |\n| --- | --- |\n| `path` | The source for the symlink, the same as in the shortcut syntax (default: null, automatic (see below)) |\n| `create` | When true, create parent directories to the link as needed. (default: false) |\n| `relink` | Removes the old target if it's a symlink (default: false) |\n| `force` | Force removes the old target, file or folder, and forces a new link (default: false) |\n| `relative` | Use a relative path to the source when creating the symlink (default: false, absolute links) |\n| `canonicalize-path` | Resolve any symbolic links encountered in the source to symlink to the canonical path (default: true, real paths) |\n| `glob` | Treat a `*` character as a wildcard, and perform link operations on all of those matches (default: false) |\n| `if` | Execute this in your `$SHELL` and only link if it is successful. |\n| `ignore-missing` | Do not fail if the source is missing and create the link anyway (default: false) |\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n- link:\n    ~/.config/terminator:\n      create: true\n      path: config/terminator\n    ~/.vim: vim\n    ~/.vimrc:\n      relink: true\n      path: vimrc\n    ~/.zshrc:\n      force: true\n      path: zshrc\n    ~/.hammerspoon:\n      if: '[ `uname` = Darwin ]'\n      path: hammerspoon\n```\n\nIf the source location is omitted or set to `null`, Dotbot will use the\nbasename of the destination, with a leading `.` stripped if present. This makes\nthe following two config files equivalent.\n\nExplicit sources:\n\n```yaml\n- link:\n    ~/bin/ack: ack\n    ~/.vim: vim\n    ~/.vimrc:\n      relink: true\n      path: vimrc\n    ~/.zshrc:\n      force: true\n      path: zshrc\n    ~/.config/:\n      glob: true\n      path: config/*\n      relink: true\n```\n\nImplicit sources:\n\n```yaml\n- link:\n    ~/bin/ack:\n    ~/.vim:\n    ~/.vimrc:\n      relink: true\n    ~/.zshrc:\n      force: true\n    ~/.config/:\n      glob: true\n      path: config/*\n      relink: true\n```\n\n### Create\n\nCreate commands specify empty directories to be created.  This can be useful\nfor scaffolding out folders or parent folder structure required for various\napps, plugins, shell commands, etc.\n\n#### Format\n\nCreate commands are specified as an array of directories to be created.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n- create:\n    - ~/projects\n    - ~/downloads\n    - ~/.vim/undo-history\n```\n\n### Shell\n\nShell commands specify shell commands to be run. Shell commands are run in the\nbase directory (that is specified when running the installer).\n\n#### Format\n\nShell commands can be specified in several different ways. The simplest way is\njust to specify a command as a string containing the command to be run.\n\nAnother way is to specify a two element array where the first element is the\nshell command and the second is an optional human-readable description.\n\nShell commands support an extended syntax as well, which provides more\nfine-grained control.\n\n| Parameter | Explanation |\n| --- | --- |\n| `command` | The command to be run |\n| `description` | A human-readable message describing the command (default: null) |\n| `quiet` | Show only the description but not the command in log output (default: false) |\n| `stdin` | Allow a command to read from standard input (default: false) |\n| `stdout` | Show a command's output from stdout (default: false) |\n| `stderr` | Show a command's error output from stderr (default: false) |\n\nNote that `quiet` controls whether the command (a string) is printed in log\noutput, it does not control whether the output from running the command is\nprinted (that is controlled by `stdout` / `stderr`). When a command's `stdin` /\n`stdout` / `stderr` is not enabled (which is the default), it's connected to\n`/dev/null`, disabling input and hiding output.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n- shell:\n  - chsh -s $(which zsh)\n  - [chsh -s $(which zsh), Making zsh the default shell]\n  -\n    command: read var && echo Your variable is $var\n    stdin: true\n    stdout: true\n    description: Reading and printing variable\n    quiet: true\n  -\n    command: read fail\n    stderr: true\n```\n\n### Clean\n\nClean commands specify directories that should be checked for dead symbolic\nlinks. These dead links are removed automatically. Only dead links that point\nto somewhere within the dotfiles directory are removed unless the `force`\noption is set to `true`.\n\n#### Format\n\nClean commands are specified as an array of directories to be cleaned.\n\nClean commands also support an extended configuration syntax.\n\n| Parameter | Explanation |\n| --- | --- |\n| `force` | Remove dead links even if they don't point to a file inside the dotfiles directory (default: false) |\n| `recursive` | Traverse the directory recursively looking for dead links (default: false) |\n\nNote: using the `recursive` option for `~` is not recommended because it will\nbe slow.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n- clean: ['~']\n\n- clean:\n    ~/:\n      force: true\n    ~/.config:\n      recursive: true\n```\n\n### Defaults\n\nDefault options for plugins can be specified so that options don't have to be\nrepeated many times. This can be very useful to use with the link command, for\nexample.\n\nDefaults apply to all commands that come after setting the defaults. Defaults\ncan be set multiple times; each change replaces the defaults with a new set of\noptions.\n\n#### Format\n\nDefaults are specified as a dictionary mapping action names to settings, which\nare dictionaries from option names to values.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n- defaults:\n    link:\n      create: true\n      relink: true\n```\n\n### Plugins\n\nDotbot also supports custom directives implemented by plugins. Plugins are\nimplemented as subclasses of `dotbot.Plugin`, so they must implement\n`can_handle()` and `handle()`. The `can_handle()` method should return `True`\nif the plugin can handle an action with the given name. The `handle()` method\nshould do something and return whether or not it completed successfully.\n\nAll built-in Dotbot directives are written as plugins that are loaded by\ndefault, so those can be used as a reference when writing custom plugins.\n\nPlugins are loaded using the `--plugin` and `--plugin-dir` options, using\neither absolute paths or paths relative to the base directory. It is\nrecommended that these options are added directly to the `install` script.\n\nSee [here][plugins] for a current list of plugins.\n\n## Command-line Arguments\n\nDotbot takes a number of command-line arguments; you can run Dotbot with\n`--help`, e.g. by running `./install --help`, to see the full list of options.\nHere, we highlight a couple that are particularly interesting.\n\n### `--only`\n\nYou can call `./install --only [list of directives]`, such as `./install --only\nlink`, and Dotbot will only run those sections of the config file.\n\n### `--except`\n\nYou can call `./install --except [list of directives]`, such as `./install\n--except shell`, and Dotbot will run all the sections of the config file except\nthe ones listed.\n\n## Wiki\n\nCheck out the [Dotbot wiki][wiki] for more information, tips and tricks,\nuser-contributed plugins, and more.\n\n## Contributing\n\nDo you have a feature request, bug report, or patch?
