    "description": "Ducker\n======\n\nWhat the duck is Ducker?\n------------------------\n\nDucker is a lightweight program that makes internet searches with DuckDuckGo\nfrom the command line. It can display the search results in your terminal or\ndirectly in DuckDuckGo's website with your browser.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nJust execute it in your shell with keywords you want to use. The following\nexample searchs for classical music by opening the search results in your\ndefault browser.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ duck classical music\n\nThere are options to search specifically for images, videos or websites.\n\nThere is also an interactive mode, which lets you make use of more advanced\noptions. Open the interactive mode by calling Ducker without arguments.\n\nWhen you make a search in the interactive mode, the search results\nare displayed in your terminal. Each result consist of a number, a title,\na URL and an abstract. After making the search you can open the URL of the\nfirst result by entering `1`. Your default browser will open that URL\n(opening a new tab if it's already running) and the program will prompt you\nagain until you decide to exit. You can quit the program entering `q`.\n\nTo check out every option execute the program with the\n`--help` or `-h` arguments.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou don't have to install Ducker to run it. Just install Python 3.3 or later\n(if you don't have it installed) and execute the `run_ducker.py` file.\n\nHowever, you can install Ducker if you want with pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install ducker\n\nCustomization\n-------------\n\nYou can always use your favourite command-line options of Ducker using Bash\naliases or other utilities available for your shell. Let's say we want to\nadd an option to search for articles in Wikipedia; we could create a Bash\nalias for that.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ alias wikipedia='ducker \\!w'\n\nCalling ``wikipedia`` in the shell would open the main page of wikipedia, and\ncalling ``wikipedia free software`` would open the `\"Free software\" article\nfrom wikipedia`_. Note that we're using `DuckDuckGo bangs`_ and that the\nexclamation mark (!) must be escaped in Bash.\n\nSimilarly, you can create an alias to never use JavaScript when using Ducker.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ alias duck='ducker --no-javascript'\n\nRelated projects\n----------------\n\n- `ddgr`_: Power tool to use DuckDuckGo from the command-line.\n- `DuckDuckGo`_: Search engine which doesn't track its users.\n- `googler`_: Power tool to Google (Web & News) and Google Site Search from the command-line.\n\n.. _DuckDuckGo bangs: https://duckduckgo.com/bang\n.. _\"Free software\" article from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software\n.. _ddgr: https://github.com/jarun/ddgr/\n.. _DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgo.com/\n.. _googler: https://github.com/jarun/googler/\n",
