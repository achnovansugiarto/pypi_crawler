A low-resolution gridded dataset can be downscaled, with the help of (an arbitrary number of) auxiliary predictor and static variables, and a high-resolution reference dataset. The mapping between the low- and high-resolution data is learned with either a supervised or a conditional generative adversarial DL model.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/carlos-gg/dl4ds/raw/master/docs/img/fig_workflow.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n\nThe training can be done from explicit pairs of high- and low-resolution samples (MOS-style, e.g., high-res observations and low-res numerical weather prediction model output) or only with a HR dataset (PerfectProg-style, e.g., high-res observations or high-res model output).\n\nA wide variety of network architectures have been implemented in `DL4DS`. The main modelling approaches can be combined into many different architectures:\n\n|Downscaling type               |Training (loss type)         |Sample type     |Backbone section              |Upsampling method   |\n|---                            |---                          |---             |---                          |---|\n|MOS (explicit pairs of HR and LR data)           |Supervised (non-adversarial) |Spatial         |Plain convolutional          |Pre-upsampling via interpolation |\n|PerfectProg (implicit pairs, only HR data)   |Conditional Adversarial    |Spatio-temporal |Residual                     |Post-upsampling via sub-pixel convolution |\n|                               |                             |                |Dense                        |Post-upsampling via resize convolution |\n|                               |                             |                |Unet (PIN, Spatial samples)  |Post-upsampling via deconvolution   |\n|                               |                             |                |Convnext (Spatial samples)   |                                      |\n\nIn `DL4DS`, we implement a channel attention mechanism to exploit inter-channel relationship of features by providing a weight for each channel in order to enhance those that contribute the most to the optimizaiton and learning process. Aditionally, a Localized Convolutional Block (LCB) is located in the output module of the networks in `DL4DS`. With the LCB we learn location-specific information via a locally connected layer with biases. \n\n`DL4DS` is built on top of Tensorflow/Keras and supports distributed GPU training (data parallelism) thanks to Horovod. \n\n# API documentation \n\nCheck out the API documentation [here](https://carlos-gg.github.io/dl4ds/).\n\n# Installation\n\n```\npip install dl4ds\n```\n\n# Example notebooks\n\nA first Colab notebook can be found in the notebooks folder.
