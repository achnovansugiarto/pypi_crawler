Built on top of the one-time\npassword framework django-otp_ and Django's built-in authentication framework\n``django.contrib.auth`` for providing the easiest integration into most Django\nprojects. Inspired by the user experience of Google's Two-Step Authentication,\nallowing users to authenticate through call, text messages (SMS), by using a\ntoken generator app like Google Authenticator or a YubiKey_ hardware token\ngenerator (optional).\n\nIf you run into problems, please file an issue on GitHub, or contribute to the\nproject by forking the repository and sending some pull requests. The package\nis translated into English, Dutch and other languages. Please contribute your\nown language using Transifex_.\n\nTest drive this app through the online `example app`_, hosted by Heroku_. It\ndemos most features except the Twilio integration. The example also includes\ndjango-user-sessions_ for providing Django sessions with a foreign key to the\nuser. Although the package is optional, it improves account security control\nover ``django.contrib.sessions``.\n\nCompatible with modern Django versions. At the moment of writing that's\nincluding 2.2, 3.0, and 3.1 on Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\nDocumentation is available at `readthedocs.org`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\nRefer to the `installation instructions`_ in the documentation.\n\n\nGetting help\n============\n\nFor general questions regarding this package, please hop over to `Stack Overflow`_.\nIf you think there is an issue with this package; check if the\nissue is already listed (either open or closed), and file an issue if\nit's not.\n\n\nContribute\n==========\n* Submit issues to the `issue tracker`_ on Github.\n* Fork the `source code`_ at Github.\n* Write some code and make sure it is covered with unit tests.\n* Send a pull request with your changes.\n* Provide a translation using Transifex_.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\nThis project aims for full code-coverage, this means that your code should be\nwell-tested. Also test branches for hardened code. You can run the full test\nsuite with::\n\n    make test\n\nOr run a specific test with::\n\n    make test TARGET=tests.tests.TwilioGatewayTest\n\nFor Python compatibility, tox_ is used. You can run the full test suite,\ncovering all supported Python and Django version with::\n\n    tox\n\nReleasing\n---------\nThe following actions are required to push a new version:\n\n* Update release notes\n* If any new translations strings were added, push the new source language to\n  Transifex_. Make sure translators have sufficient time to translate those\n  new strings::\n\n    make tx-push\n\n* Add migrations::\n\n    python example/manage.py makemigrations two_factor\n    git commit two_factor/migrations -m \"Added migrations\"\n\n* Update translations::\n\n    make tx-pull\n\n* Package and upload::\n\n    bumpversion [major|minor|patch]\n    git push && git push --tags\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n    twine upload dist/*\n\n\nSee Also\n========\nHave a look at django-user-sessions_ for Django sessions with a foreign key to\nthe user.
