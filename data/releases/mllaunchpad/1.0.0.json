It also offers lightweight model life cycle\nmanagement functionality.\n\nIt creates a separation between machine learning\nmodels and their environment. This way, you can run your model with\ndifferent `data sources <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasources.html>`_.\nand on different environments, by just swapping\nout the configuration, no code changes required. ML Launchpad makes your\nmodel available as a business-facing *RESTful API*\nwithout extra coding.\n\nCurrently, some basic model life cycle management is supported. Training\nautomatically persists a model in the model store together with its metrics,\nand automatically retrieves it for launching its API or\nre-training. Previous models are backed up.\n\nThe full documentation is available at https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io.\n\nTo learn more about the rationale and structure of ML Launchpad,\nsee `Description <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html>`_.\n\nGetting started\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. code:: console\n\n  $ pip install mllaunchpad\n\nDownload the `example files <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples.zip>`_\nfrom the ML Launchpad GitHub repo. Some of them might require the installations\nof some extra packages (e.g. scikit-learn), depending on what they demonstrate.\n\nFor more about installation, or if you don't want to use ``pip``\nand instead install from source (as a user), please see the section `Installation <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.\n\nIf you want to work on ML Launchpad itself, see `Contributing <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.\n\nWhat's in the box?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you downloaded the source, you see several subfolders, where ``mllaunchpad``\nis the actual ML Launchpad package and the rest are examples and\ndevelopment tools. You can safely ignore anything except the examples.\n\nThe ``examples`` contain a few example model implementations.\nLook here for inspiration on how to use this package. Every model here\nconsists of at least three files:\n\n* ``<examplename>_model.py``: the example's actual model code\n\n* ``<examplename>_cfg.yml``: the example's configuration file\n\n* ``<examplename>.raml``: example's RESTful API specification.\n  Used, among others, to parse and validate parameters.\n\n* There are also some extra files, like CSV files to use, or\n  `datasource <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasources.html>`_.\n  extensions.\n\nThe subfolder ``testserver`` contains an example for running a REST API\nin gunicorn behind nginx.\n\nTry Out the Examples\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the following, it is assumed that ``mllaunchpad`` is `installed <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ and\nthe `examples <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples.zip>`_ are located in the current directory.\n\nTo train a very, *very* simple example model whose job it is to add two\nnumbers, use the command:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n  $ mllaunchpad -c addition_cfg.yml t\n\n(We give it a config file after the ``-c`` parameter, and ``t`` is\nshort for the command ``train``. There's also a parameter ``-h`` to\nprint help. For all details of the command line interface, see\nthe `Usage section <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#command-line-interface>`_.)\n\nSome log information is printed (you can give it a log-config file to\nchange this, see examples/logging_cfg.yml). At the end, it should say\n“Created and stored trained model”, followed by something about metrics.\n\nThis created a model_store if it didn't exist yet (which for now is just\na directory). For our examples, the model store is conveniently located\nin the same directory. It contains our persisted ``addition`` model and\nits metadata.\n\nTo re-test the previously trained model, use the command ``r``:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   $ mllaunchpad -c addition_cfg.yml r\n\nTo run a (debugging-only!) REST API for the model, use the command\n``a``:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   $ mllaunchpad -c addition_cfg.yml a\n\nTo quickly try out out our fancy addition model API, open this link in a\nbrowser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/add/v0/sum?x1=3&x2=2\n(``curl \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/add/v0/sum?x1=3&x2=2\"`` on the command\nline)\n\nWhat next?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHave a look at the ``addition`` example's python code (and comments),\nits yml config, then look at the other examples. First, we suggest the\n``tree`` example for intermediate complexity (although its prediction\ncode does quite some complex stuff to be compatible with three different\nkinds of prediction usage, which is not really that realistic).\n\nIf you are wondering about the RAML file (which is a RESTful API\nspecification standard that is used in some corporate environments, and\na good idea in general), also look at the ``g`` (``generate-raml``) command\nline parameter, which does a lot of work (almost all of it, in fact) for\ngetting you started with a first RAML.\n\nTo learn how to use ML Launchpad, see `Usage <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_.\n\nFor more details on how ML Launchpad actually works and why we created it,\nsee `In Depth <https://mllaunchpad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html>`_.\n\nTroubleshooting\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn case the console command ``mllaunchpad <your_arguments>`` is not recognized,\ntry:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n  $ python -m mllaunchpad <your_arguments>\n\nIf you get an error like ``No module named 'your_model'``, the file\n``your_model.py`` is not in the python path. You can try to set the\n`PYTHONPATH environment variable <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH>`_\nto the path(s) to your file(s), or, if you're using ``mllaunchpad``\nfrom your own python code, append the path(s) to\n`sys.path <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=sys.path#sys.path>`_.\n\nIf you get ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mllaunchpad'`` (in\n``mllaunchpad/__main__.py``), try to start flask the following way:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   $ export FLASK_APP=mllaunchpad.wsgi:application\n   $ export LAUNCHPAD_CFG=addition_cfg.yml\n   $ flask run\n\n(On Windows, use ``set`` instead of ``export``)\n\nThis problem appears to be connected to Flask restarting in different ways on\ndifferent installations. If you know what exactly this is about, `please let us\nknow <https://github.com/schuderer/mllaunchpad/issues/30>`_.\n\n\n",
