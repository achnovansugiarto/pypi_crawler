    "description": "# Analyze numerical issues in linear programs\n\nThis tool helps resolve numerical issues in a linear programming\nmodel. I developed it will doing research for the [REAM Research Lab](https://patyhidalgo.github.io/)\non the [SWITCH](http://switch-model.org/) Power System Planning\nModel.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Generate a `.mps` file of the linear program you want to analyze (see instructions below).\n2. Install this package: `pip install lp-analyzer`\n3. Run the analyzer: `lp-analyzer <path_to_mps_file> -o <path_to_output_text_file>`\n4. The generated output file will give you useful\ninsights into the numerical properties of your model to help \nyou solve numerical issues. For example, it tells you the range of your coefficients\non a per constraint and per variable basis which tells you how to\nscale your model.\n\n## Detailed guide\n\n### What are numerical issues in linear programming?\n\n[Linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) allows us to find optimal solutions\nto problems by defining problems as a set of linear equations.\n\nToday, there exists numerical solvers that can read millions\nof these equations and find the optimal solution automatically. \nFor example, [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) is one of these solvers.\n\nThese millions of equations have numerical coefficients. When these\ncoefficients are too large or too small in magnitude (e.g. 10<sup>10</sup>\nor 10<sup>-10</sup>), solvers like Gurobi struggle to find\nthe optimal solution. We say that we're encountering numerical\nissues. This is because such large or small\nvalues are challenging to store on a floating-point computer\n(see [here](https://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/bachelor/IEEE754_article.pdf) for more info).\n\nOne solution to this problem is 'scaling' the equations.\nBasically if all the numbers are too big we can scale them down\nwithout affecting our results.\n\n### What does this tool do?\n\nTo scale our model, we need to know how big or small or numbers are\n(to know how much we should scale them by). This tool\nhelps you figure that out! Analyzing the equations by hand\nis challenging since models can get extremely large. This\ntool automatically analyzes a linear programming model\nand returns the range of different coefficients\n to help you determine which coefficients need scaling.\n\n### How to use this tool?\n\n#### Install it\n\nSimply run `pip install lp-analyzer`.\n\nIf you want to install from the source code, clone the repository to download the code\nand run within the directory `pip install .`.\n\n#### Run it on a `.mps` file\n\nFor now this tool only reads [`.mps` files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPS_(format)). This\nfile type stores a linear program model.\n\nOnce you have your `.mps` file simply run:\n\n`lp_analyzer path/to/file.mps`\n\nThe relevant ranges will be automatically printed! \nUse `-o output.txt` to save the output to a file.\n\n#### Using with Pyomo\n\nIf you're trying to use\nthis tool with a Pyomo model you'll first need to generate\na `.lp` file then a `.mps` file. \n\nFirst solve the model with `keepfiles=True, symbolic_solver_labels=True`. For example,\n\n```\nresults = solver.solve(model, tee=True, keepfiles=True, symbolic_solver_labels=True)\n```\n\nThis will save an `.lp` file to a temporary directory (as listed in the console output).\n\n\nOnce you have your `.lp` file, you can use the Gurobi\nprompt to convert it to an `.mps` file.\n\nOpen the Gurobi prompt (normally just run `gurobi`),\nthen run the following commands. This will create a\n`model_file.mps` file which you can use with this tool (see above).\n\n```\ngurobi> m = read(\"model_file.lp\")\n...\ngurobi> m = m.presolve()\n...\ngurobi> m.write(\"model_file.mps\")\n```\nThe `presolve()` step is optional, but will remove\nunnecessary equations making your analysis more relevant.\nYou can read more about `presolve()` [here](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/presolve2.html).\n\n#### Using with SWITCH\n\n[SWITCH](https://github.com/switch-model/switch) \nis a platform for planning high-renewable power systems\nthat uses linear programming.\n\nThe steps to using this library with SWITCH are nearly identical to that of using it with Pyomo.\nThe only difference is you can use the following command to generate the `.lp` file.\n\n`switch solve --solver gurobi -v --keepfiles --tempdir temp --symbolic-solver-labels`\n\nThis will save the `.lp` file to the `temp` folder. \nTo learn more about what each flag does run `switch solve -h`.\n",
