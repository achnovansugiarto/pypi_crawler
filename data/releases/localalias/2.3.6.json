If you want to define a new command using\nan alias, you have to choose a new alias name. This forces you to define many aliases, some of them\nwith very obscure names that you will never remember. localalias solves this problem by\nproviding an additional level of abstraction to your shell's default alias design scheme.\n\nLocal aliases allow you to abstract away from whatever project you are working on, by giving you\nthe ability to setup generic aliases for what are, in actuality, very specific tasks. In my own\nsetup, for example, I alias ``r`` to the command that launches the project I am working on. When in\nthe top-level directory of the localalias project directory, running ``r`` is equivalent to\n``python localalias``.  If I change directories, however, to work on a different project, running\n``r`` will run a different command---one corresponding to the new project.  I use multiple patterns\nlike this to simplify my own workflow: ``t`` runs the tests, ``b`` builds the project, ``v`` opens\nup files in ``vim``. [#]_\n\n.. [#] I normally use multiple variations of this last one: ``v`` opens up the most active files\n   (the ones I am most likely to want to edit), ``vt`` opens up test files, ``vd`` opens up doc\n   files, etc..\n\n.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFor more information, please refer to this project's official `documentation`_.\n\nThere you will also find instructions for `installation`_ and tips for general `usage`_.\n\n.. _documentation: https://localalias.readthedocs.io\n.. _installation: https://localalias.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n.. _usage: https://localalias.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html",
