    "description": "Docker Compose\n==============\n![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true \"Docker Compose Logo\")\n\n## :exclamation: The docker-compose project announces that as Python 2 has reached it's EOL, versions 1.26.x will be the last to support it. For more information, please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6890).\n\nCompose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.\nWith Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services.\nThen, using a single command, you create and start all the services\nfrom your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose\nsee [the list of features](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/index.md#features).\n\nCompose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as well as\nCI workflows. You can learn more about each case in\n[Common Use Cases](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/index.md#common-use-cases).\n\nUsing Compose is basically a three-step process.\n\n1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be\nreproduced anywhere.\n2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so\nthey can be run together in an isolated environment.\n3. Lastly, run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire app.\n\nA `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:\n\n    version: '2'\n\n    services:\n      web:\n        build: .\n        ports:\n         - \"5000:5000\"\n        volumes:\n         - .:/code\n      redis:\n        image: redis\n\nFor more information about the Compose file, see the\n[Compose file reference](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning.md).\n\nCompose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:\n\n * Start, stop and rebuild services\n * View the status of running services\n * Stream the log output of running services\n * Run a one-off command on a service\n\nInstallation and documentation\n------------------------------\n\n- Full documentation is available on [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\n- Code repository for Compose is on [GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose).\n- If you find any problems please fill out an [issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose). Thank you!\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/buildStatus/icon?job=compose/master)](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/job/compose/job/master/)\n\nWant to help build Compose? Check out our [contributing documentation](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nReleasing\n---------\n\nReleases are built by maintainers, following an outline of the [release process](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/project/RELEASE-PROCESS.md).\n\n\n",
