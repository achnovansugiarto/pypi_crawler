    "description": "Docker Compose\n==============\n[![Build Status](http://jenkins.dockerproject.com/buildStatus/icon?job=Compose Master)](http://jenkins.dockerproject.com/job/Compose%20Master/)\n*(Previously known as Fig)*\n\nCompose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker.\nWith Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then\nspin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to\nbe done to get it running.\n\nCompose is great for development environments, staging servers, and CI. We don't\nrecommend that you use it in production yet.\n\nUsing Compose is basically a three-step process.\n\nFirst, you define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be\nreproduced anywhere:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python:2.7\nWORKDIR /code\nADD requirements.txt /code/\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nADD . /code\nCMD python app.py\n```\n\nNext, you define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so\nthey can be run together in an isolated environment:\n\n```yaml\nweb:\n  build: .\n  links:\n   - db\n  ports:\n   - \"8000:8000\"\ndb:\n  image: postgres\n```\n\nLastly, run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire app.\n\nCompose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:\n\n * Start, stop and rebuild services\n * View the status of running services\n * Stream the log output of running services\n * Run a one-off command on a service\n\nInstallation and documentation\n------------------------------\n\n- Full documentation is available on [Docker's website](http://docs.docker.com/compose/).\n- Hop into #docker-compose on Freenode if you have any questions.\n",
