    "description": "Docker Compose\n==============\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/docker/compose/raw/master/logo.png?raw=true\n   :alt: Docker Compose Logo\n\n   Docker Compose\n\nCompose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker\napplications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your\napplication's services. Then, using a single command, you create and\nstart all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all\nthe features of Compose see `the list of\nfeatures <https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/overview.md#features>`__.\n\nCompose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as\nwell as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in `Common Use\nCases <https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/overview.md#common-use-cases>`__.\n\nUsing Compose is basically a three-step process.\n\n1. Define your app's environment with a ``Dockerfile`` so it can be\n   reproduced anywhere.\n2. Define the services that make up your app in ``docker-compose.yml``\n   so they can be run together in an isolated environment.\n3. Lastly, run ``docker-compose up`` and Compose will start and run your\n   entire app.\n\nA ``docker-compose.yml`` looks like this:\n\n::\n\n    version: '2'\n\n    services:\n      web:\n        build: .\n        ports:\n         - \"5000:5000\"\n        volumes:\n         - .:/code\n      redis:\n        image: redis\n\nFor more information about the Compose file, see the `Compose file\nreference <https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning.md>`__\n\nCompose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your\napplication:\n\n-  Start, stop and rebuild services\n-  View the status of running services\n-  Stream the log output of running services\n-  Run a one-off command on a service\n\nInstallation and documentation\n------------------------------\n\n-  Full documentation is available on `Docker's\n   website <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__.\n-  If you have any questions, you can talk in real-time with other\n   developers in the #docker-compose IRC channel on Freenode. `Click\n   here to join using\n   IRCCloud. <https://www.irccloud.com/invite?hostname=irc.freenode.net&channel=%23docker-compose>`__\n-  Code repository for Compose is on\n   `Github <https://github.com/docker/compose>`__\n-  If you find any problems please fill out an\n   `issue <https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new>`__\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n|Build Status|\n\nWant to help build Compose? Check out our `contributing\ndocumentation <https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.\n\nReleasing\n---------\n\nReleases are built by maintainers, following an outline of the `release\nprocess <https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/project/RELEASE-PROCESS.md>`__.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://jenkins.dockerproject.org/buildStatus/icon?job=docker/compose/master\n   :target: https://jenkins.dockerproject.org/job/docker/job/compose/job/master/\n",
