    "description": "Docker Compose\n==============\n[![Build Status](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/buildStatus/icon?job=compose/master)](https://ci-next.docker.com/public/job/compose/job/master/)\n\n![Docker Compose](logo.png?raw=true \"Docker Compose Logo\")\n\nDocker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker\ndefined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).\nA Compose file is used to define how the one or more containers that make up\nyour application are configured.\nOnce you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a\nsingle command: `docker-compose up`.\n\nCompose files can be used to deploy applications locally, or to the cloud on\n[Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) or\n[Microsoft ACI](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/) using\nthe Docker CLI. You can read more about how to do this:\n- [Compose for Amazon ECS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/ecs-integration/)\n- [Compose for Microsoft ACI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/aci-integration/)\n\nWhere to get Docker Compose\n----------------------------\n\n### Windows and macOS\n\nDocker Compose is included in\n[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\nfor Windows and macOS.\n\n### Linux\n\nYou can download Docker Compose binaries from the\n[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.\n\n### Using pip\n\nIf your platform is not supported, you can download Docker Compose using `pip`:\n\n```console\npip install docker-compose\n```\n\n> **Note:** Docker Compose requires Python 3.6 or later.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nUsing Docker Compose is basically a three-step process:\n1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be\n   reproduced anywhere.\n2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so\n   they can be run together in an isolated environment.\n3. Lastly, run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire\n   app.\n\nA Compose file looks like this:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/code\n  redis:\n    image: redis\n```\n\nYou can find examples of Compose applications in our\n[Awesome Compose repository](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose).\n\nFor more information about the Compose format, see the\n[Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWant to help develop Docker Compose? Check out our\n[contributing documentation](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you find an issue, please report it on the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/new/choose).\n\nReleasing\n---------\n\nReleases are built by maintainers, following an outline of the [release process](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/project/RELEASE-PROCESS.md).\n\n\n",
