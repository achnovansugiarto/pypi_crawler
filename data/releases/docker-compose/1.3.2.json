    "description": "Docker Compose\n==============\n*(Previously known as Fig)*\n\nCompose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications with\nDocker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single\nfile, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything\nthat needs to be done to get it running.\n\nCompose is great for development environments, staging servers, and CI. We don't\nrecommend that you use it in production yet.\n\nUsing Compose is basically a three-step process.\n\n1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be\nreproduced anywhere.\n2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so\nthey can be run together in an isolated environment:\n3. Lastly, run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire app.\n\nA `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:\n\n    web:\n      build: .\n      ports:\n       - \"5000:5000\"\n      volumes:\n       - .:/code\n      links:\n       - redis\n    redis:\n      image: redis\n\nCompose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:\n\n * Start, stop and rebuild services\n * View the status of running services\n * Stream the log output of running services\n * Run a one-off command on a service\n\nInstallation and documentation\n------------------------------\n\n- Full documentation is available on [Docker's website](http://docs.docker.com/compose/).\n- If you have any questions, you can talk in real-time with other developers in the #docker-compose IRC channel on Freenode.
