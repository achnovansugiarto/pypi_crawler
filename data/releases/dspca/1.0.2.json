    "description": "Demixed Subspace Principal Component Analysis (dsPCA)\n===========================================\n\ndsPCA is a dimensionality reduction algorithm for high-dimensional data such as neural population activity. dsPCA describes high-dimensional data by finding best demixed linear coding axes for targeted variables and finding linear dimensions that concicely describe the remaining variance in the data. The demixed coding axes for targeted variables are identified with a supervised approach, and then the axes that capture the remaining variance in the data are identified with an unsupervised approach. Importantly, dsPCA completely removes the linear coding of target signals from data before the unsupervised axis identifications. Therefore, dsPCA decomposes a high-dimensional data into a subspace that fully captures all target signals in the data and a subspace that is free of all target signals.\n\n\n## Installation\nRun the following command to install the package.\n~~~~\npip install dspca\n~~~~\n\n## How to use\ndsPCA code is written for Python 3.x    \nPlease check an example demo in **dsPCA_demo.ipynb** for the basic implementation.\n\nAfter installation, import dsPCA\n~~~~\nfrom dspca.dspca import dsPCA\n~~~~\nProvide data ([# of observations] X [# of dimensions to be reduced]) and targets ([# of observations] X [# of targets]) \n~~~~\ndsPCA(data=data, targets=targets)\n~~~~\nThe outputs of the function are in the order of\n~~~~\nprojection_target_subspace\nprojection_targetfree_subspace\nax_targets, ax_targetfree\ntarget_subspace_signal\ntargetfree_subspace_signal\ntarget_subspace_var\ntargetfree_subspace_var\ntotal_var\ndot_target_ax\n~~~~\nprojection_target_subspace\n- Projection of data onto demixed target signal axes.\n\nprojection_targetfree_subspace\n- Projection of population activity to the axes of target-free subspace.\n\nax_targets\n- Axis vectors for the target signal subspace.\n\nax_targetfree\n- Axis vectors for the target-free signal subspace.\n\ntarget_subspace_signal\n- Pearson correlation coefficient between the projected data along each target axis and the targeted task-related variables.\n\ntargetfree_subspace_signal\n- Pearson correlation coefficient between the projected data along each target-free axis and the targeted task-related variables.\n\ntarget_subspace_var\n- Data variance along each taraget axis.\n\ntargetfree_subspace_var\n- Data variance along each taraget-free axis.\n\ntotal_var\n- Total data variance of the original input data.\n\ndot_target_ax\n- Matrix with dot products between pairs of target axis vectors.",
