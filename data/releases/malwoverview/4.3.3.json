It submits only hashes, so respecting Non-Disclosure \n     Agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, if you use the \"-V\" (uppercase), \"-A\" (uppercase)\n     or \"-P\" (uppercase), so Malwoverview SUBMITS your malware sample to Virus Total,\n     Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm, respectively. Additionally, options \"-Y\" and \"-T\"\n     also sent the Android package from Android device to Hybrid-Analysis and Virus \n     Total, respectively.  \n\n\n# ABOUT\n\nMalwoverview.py is a first response tool for threat hunting, which performs an initial and quick \ntriage of malware samples, URLs, IP addresses, domains, malware families, IOCs and hashes.\n\nThis tool aims to : \n\n1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group \n   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!\n2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, \n   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. \n3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. \n4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.\n5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. \n6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, URLHaus, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.\n7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.\n8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.\n9. List last payloads from URLHaus. \n10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.\n11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.\n12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. \n13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and \n    ThreatCrowd. \n14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. \n15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. \n16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.\n17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.\n18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.\n19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. \n21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and\n    malware family. \n22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. \n23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. \n24. Gather threat hunting information from ThreatCrowd using different criteria. \n25. Provide Yara rules and associated information from Valhalla. \n26. Gather threat hunting information from Malware Bazaar using different criteria. \n27. Gather IOC information from ThreatFox using different criteria. \n\n\n\n# CONTRIBUTORS:\n\n      Alexandre Borges (project owner)\n      Corey Forman (https://github.com/digitalsleuth)\n      Christian Clauss (https://github.com/cclauss)\n\n# INSTALLATION \n\nThis tool has been tested on Ubuntu, Kali Linux 2021, REMnux, Windows 8.1 and 10. Malwoverview \ncan be installed by executing the following command:\n\n      pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) \n      or...\n      python -m pip install -U malwoverview\n      or...\n      git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\n\nTo use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,\nAlien Vault and Malpedia APIs into the .malwapi.conf configuration file (the default one at the \nhome directory -- if the file doesn't exist, so you should create it) or you could create a \ncustom configuration file and indicate it by using the -c option. \n\nA special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault \nwebsite before using -n 1 option.  \n\nThe .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory) has the following format:\n\n      [VIRUSTOTAL]\n      VTAPI = \n\n      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]\n      HAAPI = \n\n      [MALSHARE]\n      MALSHAREAPI = \n\n      [HAUSSUBMIT]\n      HAUSSUBMITAPI =\n\n      [POLYSWARM]\n      POLYAPI = \n\n      [ALIENVAULT]\n      ALIENAPI = \n\n      [MALPEDIA]\n      MALPEDIAAPI =\n\n      [VALHALLA]\n      VALHALLAAPI =\n\n\nThe APIs can be requested on the respective service websites:\n\n1. Virus Total (community and paid API): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us\n2. Hybrid Analysis: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup\n3. Malshare: https://malshare.com/doc.php\n4. URLHaus: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#account \n5. Polyswarm: https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers\n6. Alien Vault: https://otx.alienvault.com/api\n7. Malpedia: It doesn't offer open registration, but you can request an user account \ndirectly through Twitter (DM) or feedback e-email. The Malpedia Twitter handle is @malpedia.\n8. Valhalla: You can use a demo API key or contract the Valhalla service for a private key.\nValhalla demo-API key is: 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.\n9. ThreatCrowd: It isn't necessary an API.\n10. Malware Bazaar: It isn't necessary an API.\n11. ThreatFox: It isn't necessary an API.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nA special note about API requests to the MALPEDIA:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe service and acceptance is based on the community vetting. Thus, it's recommended \nyou send a request for an API from your business e-mail address and NOT \npublic/free one (Gmail, Outlook and so on). Additionally, it'd be great whether \nyou provided further information about you (LinkedIn account, Twitter and so on) \nbecause it would make simpler to proof your identity, professional profile and \nlegitimacy, so making quicker the approval of your request.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn Windows systems, create the .malwapi.conf file in the C:\\Users\\\\[username\\] directory \n(Windows home user directory). In Linux systems, create the .malwapi.conf file in \n/home/\\[username\\] directory (Linux home user directory).\n\nAdditionally, you don't need to specify \"-w 1\" option while using malwoverview.py on Windows\nanymore. \n\nTo check the installation, execute:\n\n       malwoverview.py --help\n\nFurther information is available on: \n\n       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/\n       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\nIf you want to perform the manual steps (usually, it is not necessary), so few steps will be necessary:\n\n## Kali Linux (manual steps)\n\n1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) \n\n       $ apt-get install python3.9  (for example)\n\n2. Python-magic.  \n\n      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:\n\n       $ pip3.9 install python-magic\n\n      Or compiling it from the github repository:\n\n       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic\n       $ cd python-magic/\n       $ python3.9 setup.py build\n       $ python3.9 setup.py install\n\n      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my \n      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py \n      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. \n\n3. Install several Python packages: \n\n       $ pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt\n\n       OR\n\n       $ pip3.9 install -U pefile\n       $ pip3.9 install -U colorama\n       $ pip3.9 install -U simplejson\n       $ pip3.9 install -U python-magic\n       $ pip3.9 install -U requests\n       $ pip3.9 install -U validators\n       $ pip3.9 install -U geocoder\n       $ pip3.9 install -U polyswarm-api\n       $ pip3.9 install -U pathlib\n       $ pip3.9 install -U configparser\n       $ pip3.9 install -U valhallaAPI\n\n4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the \"adb\" program by executing the following command:\n\n       # apt get install adb\n\n   PS: before trying Android's options, check:\n\n       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.\n       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using \"adb devices -l\"\n\n5. Finally, you can install Malwoverview using one of the following methods:\n\n         pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) \n\n         or...\n\n         python -m pip install -U malwoverview\n\n         or...\n\n         git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\n\n## Windows (manual steps)\n\n1. Install the Python version 3.8.x or later from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ \n\n2. Python-magic. \n\n      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:\n\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install python-magic\n\n      Or compiling it from the github repository:\n\n       C:\\> git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic\n       C:\\> cd python-magic/\n       C:\\> python.exe setup.py build\n       C:\\> python.exe setup.py install\n\n3. Install several Python packages: \n\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n       OR: \n\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U pefile\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U colorama\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U simplejson\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U python-magic\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U requests\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U validators\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U geocoder\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U polyswarm-api\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U pathlib\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U configparser\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U python-magic-bin\n       C:\\> python.exe -m pip install -U valhallaAPI\n\n4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the \"adb\" program by:\n\n       * Downloading and installing the Android Studio from: https://developer.android.com/\n         studio#downloads (Recommended)\n       * Downloading it from:\n         https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip\n\n   PS: before trying Android's options, check:\n\n       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.\n       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using \"adb devices -l\"\n\n5. Finally, you can install Malwoverview using one of the following methods:\n\n         pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method)\n\n         or...\n\n         python -m pip install -U malwoverview\n\n         or...\n\n         git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\n\n# USAGE\n\nTo use the malwoverview, execute the command as shown below:\n\n      root@ubuntu19:~/malwoverview# python3.9 malwoverview.py  | more\n\n      usage: python malwoverview.py -c <API configuration file> -d <directory> -f <fullpath> \n      -o <0|1> -v <0|1|2|3> -a <0|1|2|3|4|5> -x <0|1> -w <0|1> -u <url> -H <hash file> \n      -V <filename> -D <0|1> -e <0|1|2|3|4> -A <filename> -g <job_id> -r <domain> -t <0|1>\n      -l <1-14> -L <hash> -U <url> -S <url> -z <tags> -K <0|1|2> -j <hash> -J <hash> \n      -P <filename> -R <PE file, IP address, domain or URL> -G <0|1|2|3|4> -y <0|1|2|3> \n      -Y <file name> -Y <file name> -T <file name> -W <tag> -k <signature> -I <ip address>\n      -n <1|2|3|4|5> -N <argument> -M <1-8> -m <argument> -Q <1-5> -q <argument> \n      -E <1|2|3|4|5> -C <argument> -b <1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10> -B <arg>\n\nMalwoverview is a first response tool for threat hunting written by Alexandre Borges.\n\noptional arguments:\n\n      -h, --help        Show this help message and exit\n      -c CONFIG FILE, --config CONFIG FILE\n                        Use a custom config file to specify API's\n      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY\n                        Specifies the directory containing malware samples.\n      -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME\n                        Specifies a full path to a malware sample. It returns general information \n                        about the file (any filetype)\n      -o BACKGROUND, --background BACKGROUND\n                        Adapts the output colors to a white terminal. The default is black terminal\n      -x OVERLAY, --overlay OVERLAY\n                        Extracts the overlay (it is used with -f option).\n      -v VIRUSTOTAL, --virustotal VIRUSTOTAL\n                        If using \"-v 1\", so it queries the Virus Total database for positives and \n                        totals. If \"v 2\" (which can be used only together with -f option), so it \n                        shows antivirus reports from the main players. If \"v 3\", so the binary's IAT \n                        and EAT are also shown. Remember: you need to edit the .malwapi.conf and insert \n                        your VT API.\n      -a HYBRID_ANALYSIS, --hybrid HYBRID_ANALYSIS\n                        Queries the Hybrid Analysis database for getting a general report. Possible \n                        values are: 1: Windows 7 32-bit; 2: Windows 7 32-bit (HWP Support); 3: \n                        Windows 64-bit; 4: Android; 5: Linux 64-bit. Remember: you need to edit the\n                        .malwapi.conf and insert your HA API and secret.\n      -u URL_VT, --vturl URL_VT\n                        SUBMITS a URL to the Virus Total scanning.\n      -I IP_VT, --ipaddrvt IP_VT\n                        This option checks an IP address on Virus Total.\n      -r URL_DOMAIN, --urldomain URL_DOMAIN\n                        This option gets a domain's report from Virus Total.\n      -H FILE_HASH, --hash FILE_HASH\n                        This option specifies the hash to be checked on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. \n                        For the Hybrid Analysis report you must use it with the -e option.\n      -V FILENAME_VT, --vtsubmit FILENAME_VT\n                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) for Virus Total scanning and gets the report. Attention: \n                        use forward slash to specify the target file even on Windows systems. Furthermore, \n                        the minimum waiting time is set up in 90 seconds because the Virus Total waiting \n                        queue. If an error occurs, so wait few minutes and try to access the report by \n                        using -f option.\n      -A SUBMIT_HA, --submitha SUBMIT_HA\n                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) to be scanned by the Hybrid Analysis engine. Use the \n                        -e option to specify the best environment to run the suspicious file.\n      -g HA_STATUS, --hastatus HA_STATUS\n                        Checks the report's status of submitted samples to Hybrid Analysis engine by \n                        providing the job ID. Possible returned status values are: IN_QUEUE, SUCCESS,\n                        ERROR, IN_PROGRESS and PARTIAL_SUCCESS.\n      -D DOWNLOAD, --download DOWNLOAD\n                        Downloads the sample from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare and Polyswarm. Options \n                        -H or -L (Hybrid Analysis and Malshare, respectively) must be specified as well \n                        -O option for Polyswarm engine.\n      -e HA_ENVIRONMENT, --haenv HA_ENVIRONMENT\n                        This option specifies the used environment to be used to test the samlple on \n                        Hybrid Analysis: <0> Windows 7 32-bits; <1> Windows 7 32-bits (with HWP Support); \n                        <2> Windows 7 64-bits; <3> Android; <4> Linux 64-bits environment. This option \n                        is used together either -H option or the -A option.\n      -t MULTITHREAD, --thread MULTITHREAD\n                        (optional) This option has several different meanings according to chosen the \n                        value. Possible values: <1>: This value is used to force multithreads on Linux \n                        whether: the -d option is specified AND you have a PAID Virus Total API or you\n                        are NOT checking the VT while using the -d option. PS1: using this option causes \n                        Imphashes not to be grouped anymore; PS2: it also works on Windows, but there is \n                        not gain in performance; <2>: This value should be used with -d option in\n                        two scenarios: 1) either including the \"-v 1\" option (Virus Total -- you'll see \n                        a complete VT response whether you have the private API) for a multithread searching\n                        and reduced output; 2) or including the -a option (Hybrid Analysis) for a multithread \n                        searching to get a complete and amazing output. If you are using the -a option, so \n                        you should pickup the right number represening the testing environment to adjust the \n                        output to your sample types. PS1: certainly, if you have a directory holding \n                        many malware samples, so you will want to test this option with -a option; PS2: it \n                        also works on Windows, but there is not gain in performance; <3>: You should use \n                        this value with -v option if you have a public Virus Total API. It forces a one \n                        minute wait every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of \n                        the malware repository.\n      -l MALSHARE_HASHES, --malsharelist MALSHARE_HASHES\n                        This option shows hashes of a specific type from the last 24 hours from Malshare \n                        repository. Possible values are: 1: PE32 (default) ; 2: Dalvik ; 3: ELF ; 4: HTML ;\n                        5: ASCII ; 6: PHP ; 7: Java ; 8: RAR ; 9: Zip ; 10: UTF-8 ; 11: MS-DOS ; 12: data ; \n                        13: PDF ; 14: Composite(OLE). You need to insert your Malshare API into the \n                        .malwapi.conf file.\n      -L MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH, --malsharehash MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH\n                        Searches for the provided hash on the Malshare repository. You need to insert your \n                        Malshare API into the .malwapi.conf file. PS: sometimes the Malshare website is \n                        unavailable, so should check the website availability if you get some error message.\n      -K HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL, --haus_payloadbatch HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL\n                        THis option has few possible values: <1> Retrieves a list of downloadable links of \n                        recent PAYLOADS (last 3 days, limited to 1000 entries) from URLHaus website; <2>: \n                        Retrieves a list of recent URLs (last 3 days, limited to 1000 entries) from URLHaus\n                        website.

If you specified \"-b 1\" \n                        then the -B's argument must be a hash; If you specified \"-b 2\" then -B's argument \n                        must be a malware tag; If you specified \"-b 3\" then the argument must be a imphash;\n                        If you specified \"-b 4\", so the argument must be \"100 or time\", where \"100\" lists \n                        last \"100 samples\" and \"time\" lists last samples added to Malware Bazaar in the last\n                        60 minutes; If you specified \"-b 5\" then the -B's argument must be a SHA256 hash; If you \n                        specified \"-b 6\", so the -B's value is the number of DAYS to filter IOCs. The default \n                        (and max) is 90 (days); If you used \"-b 7\" so the -B's argument is the IOC you want\n                        to search for; If you used \"-b 8\", so the -B's argument is the TAG you want search \n                        for; If you used \"-b 9\", so the -B argument is the malware family you want to search\n                        for;\n\n\n      Remember that public VT API only allows 4 searches per second (as shown at the image above). Therefore,\n      if you are willing to wait some minutes, so you can use the -p option, which forces a one minute wait \n      every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of the repository.\n\n\n      * ATTENTION 1: if the directory contains many malware samples while using -d option, so malwoverview.py\n                     could take some time. Nonetheless, you can use the new -t option (multithreading) to\n                     speed-up things. :)\n\n      ** ATTENTION 2: All engines enforces quota of submission and/or verification per day and/or month. \n                      Take care!\n\n      *** ATTENTION 3: Some options searching on Hybrid Analysis strongly depend of the \"-e\" option, which \n                       specifies the environment. Therefore, to check an Android sample (for example) it is \n                       necessary to use the right environment (-e 3 for Android).\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n      malwoverview.py -d
