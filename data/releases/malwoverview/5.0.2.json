There're specific options\n     that explicitly submit samples, but these options are explained in the help.\n\n\n# ABOUT\n\nMalwoverview.py is a first response tool for threat hunting, which performs an initial and quick \ntriage of malware samples, URLs, IP addresses, domains, malware families, IOCs and hashes. Additionally,\nMalwoverview is able to get dynamic and static behavior reports, submit and download samples\nfrom several endpoints.\n\nThis tool aims to : \n\n1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group \n   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!\n2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, \n   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. \n3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. \n4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.\n5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. \n6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, URLHaus, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.\n7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.\n8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.\n9. List last payloads from URLHaus. \n10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.\n11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.\n12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. \n13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and \n    ThreatCrowd. \n14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. \n15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. \n16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.\n17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.\n18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.\n19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. \n21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and\n    malware family. \n22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. \n23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. \n24. Gather threat hunting information from ThreatCrowd using different criteria. \n25. Gather threat hunting information from Malware Bazaar using different criteria. \n26. Gather IOC information from ThreatFox using different criteria. \n27. Gather threat hunting information from Triage using different criteria. \n28. Get evaluation to hashes from a given file against Virus Total. \n29. Submit large files (>= 32 MB) to Virus Total. \n30. Malwoverview uses Virus Total API v.3, so there isn't longer any option using v.2.\n\n\n# CONTRIBUTORS:\n\n      Alexandre Borges (project owner)\n      Corey Forman (https://github.com/digitalsleuth)\n      Christian Clauss (https://github.com/cclauss)\n\n# INSTALLATION \n\nThis tool has been tested on REMnux, Ubuntu and Kali Linux only. Malwoverview \ncan be installed by executing the following command:\n\n      * pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) \n\n      or...\n\n      * python -m pip install -U malwoverview\n\n      or...\n\n      * git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\n\nTo use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,\nAlien Vault, Malpedia  and Triage into the .malwapi.conf configuration file \n(the default one at the home directory (/home/[username] or /root) -- if the file doesn't exist,\nso you should create it) or you could create a custom configuration file and indicate it by \nusing the -c option. \n\nNonetheless, starting on version 4.4.2, it isn't longer necessary to insert all APIs into .malwapi.conf\nbefore using Malwoverview. Therefore, users can only insert few APIs and use the respective options \nto these APIs. \n\n* A special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault \nwebsite before using -n 1 option.  \n\nThe .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory -- /home/[username] or /root) \nhas the following format:\n\n      [VIRUSTOTAL]\n      VTAPI = \n\n      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]\n      HAAPI = \n\n      [MALSHARE]\n      MALSHAREAPI = \n\n      [HAUSSUBMIT]\n      HAUSSUBMITAPI =\n\n      [POLYSWARM]\n      POLYAPI = \n\n      [ALIENVAULT]\n      ALIENAPI = \n\n      [MALPEDIA]\n      MALPEDIAAPI =\n\n      [TRIAGE]\n      TRIAGEAPI =\n\n\nThe APIs can be requested on the respective service websites:\n\n1. Virus Total (community and paid API): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us\n2. Hybrid Analysis: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup\n3. Malshare: https://malshare.com/doc.php\n4. URLHaus: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#account \n5. Polyswarm: https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers\n6. Alien Vault: https://otx.alienvault.com/api\n7. Malpedia: It doesn't offer open registration, but you can request an user account \n   directly through Twitter (DM) or feedback e-email. The Malpedia Twitter \n   handle is @malpedia.\n8. ThreatCrowd: It isn't necessary an API.\n9. Malware Bazaar: It isn't necessary an API.\n10. ThreatFox: It isn't necessary an API.\n11. Triage: https://tria.ge/signup.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nA special note about API requests to the MALPEDIA:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe service and acceptance is based on the community vetting. Thus, it's recommended \nyou send a request for an API from your business e-mail address and NOT \npublic/free one (Gmail, Outlook and so on). Additionally, it'd be great whether \nyou provided further information about you (LinkedIn account, Twitter and so on) \nbecause it would make simpler to proof your identity, professional profile and \nlegitimacy, so making quicker the approval of your request.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nAdditional explanation about Triage:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nEvery Triage operation is based on the Triage ID of each artifact, so you need to\nuse the \"-x 1 -X \\<attribute\\>:\\<value\\>\" to look for the correct ID of the artifact,\nso use this ID information with the remaining Triage options (-x [2-7]) for getting \nfurther threat hunting information from Triage endpoint.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nNote about background color of the terminal:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nMalwoverview has been written to produce outputs to \ndark background terminal. However, there's the -o \noption, which changes and adapts output's colors to \nlight background.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOn Linux systems, create the .malwapi.conf file within /home/\\[username\\] directory \n(Linux home user directory -- /home/[username] or /root).\n\nJust in case you install it on Windows systems, you should create the .malwapi.conf \nfile in the C:\\Users\\\\[username\\] directory (Windows home user directory). \n\nTo check the installation, execute:\n\n       malwoverview.py --help\n\nFurther information is available on: \n\n       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/\n       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview\n\nIf you want to perform the manual steps (usually, it is not necessary), so few steps \nshould be executed:\n\n## REMnux / Ubuntu (manual steps)\n\n1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) \n\n       $ apt-get install python3.9  (for example)\n\n2. Python-magic.  \n\n      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:\n\n       $ pip3.9 install python-magic\n\n      Or compiling it from the github repository:\n\n       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic\n       $ cd python-magic/\n       $ python3.9 setup.py build\n       $ python3.9 setup.py install\n\n      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my \n      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py \n      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. \n\n3. Install several Python packages: \n\n       $ pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt\n\n       OR\n\n       $ pip3.9 install -U pefile\n       $ pip3.9 install -U colorama\n       $ pip3.9 install -U simplejson\n       $ pip3.9 install -U python-magic\n       $ pip3.9 install -U requests\n       $ pip3.9 install -U validators\n       $ pip3.9 install -U geocoder\n       $ pip3.9 install -U polyswarm-api\n       $ pip3.9 install -U pathlib\n       $ pip3.9 install -U configparser\n\n4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the \"adb\" program by executing the following command:\n\n       # apt get install adb\n\n   PS: before trying Android's options, check:\n\n       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.\n       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using \"adb devices -l\"\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n    malwoverview.py -d
