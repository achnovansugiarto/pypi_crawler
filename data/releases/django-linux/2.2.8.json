    "description": "Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.\n\nAll documentation is in the “docs” directory and online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you’re just getting started, here’s how we recommend you read the docs:\n\nFirst, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.\nNext, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt, docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).\nIf you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.\nYou’ll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.\nSee docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.\nDocs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket\n\nTo get more help:\n\nJoin the #django channel on irc.freenode.net. Lots of helpful people hang out there. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC/Tutorial if you’re new to IRC.\nJoin the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at https://groups.google.com/group/django-users.\nTo contribute to Django:\n\nCheck out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/ for information about getting involved.\nTo run Django’s test suite:\n\nFollow the instructions in the “Unit tests” section of docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt, published online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests\n\n",
