    "description": "====================\nDjango User Sessions\n====================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Bouke/django-user-sessions.svg?branch=master\n    :alt: Build Status\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/Bouke/django-user-sessions\n\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/Bouke/django-user-sessions/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :alt: Test Coverage\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/Bouke/django-user-sessions\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-user-sessions.svg\n    :alt: PyPI\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-user-sessions\n\nDjango includes excellent built-in sessions, however all the data is hidden\naway into base64 encoded data. This makes it very difficult to run a query on\nall active sessions for a particular user. `django-user-sessions` fixes this\nand makes session objects a first class citizen like other ORM objects.\n\nI would love to hear your feedback on this package. If you run into\nproblems, please file an issue on GitHub, or contribute to the project by\nforking the repository and sending some pull requests. The package is\ntranslated into English, Dutch and other languages. Please contribute your own\nlanguage using Transifex_.\n\nAlso, have a look at the online `example app`_, hosted by Heroku_. It also\ncontains the package `django-two-factor-auth`_, but that application is not a\ndependency for this package. Also have a look at the bundled example templates\nand views to see how you can integrate the application into your project.\n\nCompatible with Django 1.8, 1.10 and 1.11 on Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.\nDocumentation is available at `readthedocs.org`_.\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nTo get the list of a user's sessions::\n\n    user.session_set.filter(expire_date__gt=now())\n\nOr logout the user everywhere::\n\n    user.session_set.all().delete()\n\nThe user's IP address and user agent are also stored on the session. This\nallows to show a list of active sessions to the user in the admin:\n\n.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/YV9Nx3f.png\n\nAnd also in a custom layout:\n\n.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/d7kZtr9.png\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n1. ``pip install django-user-sessions``\n2. In ``INSTALLED_APPS`` replace ``'django.contrib.sessions'`` with\n   ``'user_sessions'``.\n3. In ``MIDDLEWARE`` or ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` replace\n   ``'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware'`` with\n   ``'user_sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware'``.\n4. Add ``SESSION_ENGINE = 'user_sessions.backends.db'``.\n5. Add ``url(r'', include('user_sessions.urls', 'user_sessions')),`` to your\n   ``urls.py``.\n6. Make sure ``LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`` is set to some page to redirect users\n   after logging out.\n7. Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` (or ``migrate``) and browse to\n   ``/account/sessions/``.\n\nGeoIP\n-----\nYou need to setup GeoIP for the location detection to work. See the Django\ndocumentation on `installing GeoIP`_. For Django versions 1.9 and newer,\n`GeoIP2`_ should be used instead as GeoIP was deprecated in 1.9.\n\n\nGetting help\n============\n\nFor general questions regarding this package, please hop over to Stack \nOverflow. If you think there is an issue with this package; check if the\nissue is already listed (either open or closed), and file an issue if\nit's not.\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n* Fork the repository on GitHub and start hacking.\n* Run the tests.\n* Send a pull request with your changes.\n* Provide a translation using Transifex_.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\nThis project aims for full code-coverage, this means that your code should be\nwell-tested. Also test branches for hardened code. You can run the full test\nsuite with::\n\n    make test\n\nOr run a specific test with::\n\n    make test TARGET=tests.tests.MiddlewareTest\n\nFor Python compatibility, tox_ is used. You can run the full test suite with::\n\n    tox\n\nReleasing\n---------\nThe following actions are required to push a new version:\n\n* Update release notes\n* If any new translations strings were added, push the new source language to\n  Transifex_. Make sure translators have sufficient time to translate those\n  new strings::\n\n    make tx-push\n\n* Add migrations::\n\n    python example/manage.py makemigrations user_sessions\n    git commit user_sessions/migrations -m \"Added migrations\"\n\n* Update translations::\n\n    make tx-pull\n\n* Package and upload::\n\n    bumpversion [major|minor|patch]\n    git push && git push --tags\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n    twine upload dist/*\n\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\nThis library was written by `Bouke Haarsma`_.\n\n\n.. _Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/django-user-sessions/\n.. _`readthedocs.org`: https://django-user-sessions.readthedocs.org/\n.. _`example app`: https://example-two-factor-auth.herokuapp.com\n.. _Heroku: https://www.heroku.com\n.. _`django-two-factor-auth`: https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth\n.. _installing GeoIP:\n   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/geoip/\n.. _GeoIP2: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/geoip2/\n.. _tox: https://testrun.org/tox/latest/\n.. _Bouke Haarsma:\n   https://twitter.com/BoukeHaarsma\n\n\n",
