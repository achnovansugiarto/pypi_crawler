    "description": "Python bindings for the Luminoso client API\n===========================================\n\nThis package contains Python code for interacting with a Luminoso text\nprocessing server through its REST API.\n\nImportant note: API version and client version\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis page covers the client that connects to the v4 API; this client is the\nobject named `luminoso_api.LuminosoClient`, which is an alias for\n`luminoso_api.v4_client.LuminosoClient`.\n\nHowever, the v5 API is now available, as is a client for using it.  That client\ncan be accessed as `luminoso_api.V5LuminosoClient` (or directly at\n`luminoso_api.v5_client.LuminosoClient`).  Documentation for the new client can\nbe found\n[here](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/luminoso-api-client-python/blob/master/V5_README.md).\nWhen the sunset period for the v4 API ends on March 3, 2019, we will remove\nthe v4 version of the client, and `luminoso_api.LuminosoClient` will become an\nalias for the v5 client.\n\nUsing this client\n=================\n\nIn this code, instead of having to authenticate each request separately,\nyou make a \"session\" object that keeps track of your login information,\nand call methods on it that will be properly authenticated.\n\nInstallation\n---------------\nThis client API is designed to be used with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, or 3.4.\n\nYou can download and install it using a Python package manager:\n\n    pip install luminoso-api\n\nor\n\n    easy_install luminoso-api\n\nOr you can download this repository and install it the usual way:\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nIf you are installing into the main Python environment on a Mac or Unix\nsystem, you will probably need to prefix those commands with `sudo` and\nenter your password, as in `sudo python setup.py install`.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\nYou interact with the API using a LuminosoClient object, which sends HTTP\nrequests to URLs starting with a given path, and keeps track of your\nauthentication information.\n\nYou can connect using a username and password:\n\n```python\n>>> from luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\n>>> proj = LuminosoClient.connect('/projects/account_id/my_project_id',\n                                  username='my_username')\nPassword for my_username: [here you enter your password]\n>>> proj.get('terms')\n[lots of terms and vectors here]\n```\n\nOr you can connect using an existing API token:\n\n```python\nfrom luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\nproj = LuminosoClient.connect('/projects/account_id/my_project_id',\n                              token='my-api-token-here')\n```\n\nYou can even save your API token to a file on your computer and load it\nautomatically, so that you don't have to specify any credentials:\n\n```python\nfrom luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\nclient = LuminosoClient.connect(token='my-api-token-here')\n# This will save a non-expiring token, regardless of whether you are currently\n# using that token or some other token.\nclient.save_token()\n# Now you can exit Python, restart your computer, etc., and your token will\n# still be saved when you come back.\nproj = LuminosoClient.connect('/projects/account_id/my_project_id')\n```\n\nWhen you connect without specifying a URL, the URL will be set to your default\naccount_id under /projects:\n\n```python\n>>> from luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\n>>> projects = LuminosoClient.connect(username='testuser')\nPassword: ...\n>>> print(projects)\n<LuminosoClient for https://analytics.luminoso.com/api/v4/projects/lumi-test/>\n```\n\nHTTP methods\n------------\n\nThe URLs you can communicate with are documented at https://analytics.luminoso.com/api/v4.\nThat documentation is the authoritative source for what you can do with the\nAPI, and this Python code is just here to help you do it.\n\nA LuminosoClient object has methods such as `.get`, `.post`, and `.put`,\nwhich correspond to the corresponding HTTP methods that the API uses. For\nexample, `.get` is used for retrieving information without changing anything,\n`.post` is generally used for creating new things or taking actions, and `.put`\nis generally used for updating information.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nMost of the time, you'll want your LuminosoClient to refer to a particular\nproject, but one case where you don't is to get a list of projects in the first\nplace:\n\n```python\nfrom luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\nclient = LuminosoClient.connect(username='jane', password=MY_SECRET_PASSWORD)\n# this points to the /projects/janeaccount/ endpoint by default,\n# where janeaccount is the account_id of jane's default account\nproject_info_list = client.get()\nprint(project_info_list)\n```\n\n\nAn example of working with a project, including the `upload` method\nthat we provide to make it convenient to upload documents in the right format:\n\n```python\nfrom luminoso_api import LuminosoClient\n\nprojects = LuminosoClient.connect(username='jane')\n\n# Create a new project by POSTing its name\nproject_id = projects.post(name='testproject')['project_id']\n\n# use that project from here on\nproject = projects.change_path(project_id)\n\ndocs = [{'title': 'First example', 'text': 'This is an example document.'},\n        {'title': 'Second example', 'text': 'Examples are a great source of inspiration.'},\n        {'title': 'Third example', 'text': 'Great things come in threes.'}]\nproject.upload('docs', docs)\njob_id = project.post('docs/recalculate')\n```\n\nThis starts an asynchronous job, returning us its ID number. We can use\n`wait_for` to block until it's ready:\n\n```python\nproject.wait_for(job_id)\n```\n\nWhen the project is ready:\n\n```python\nresponse = project.get('terms')\nterms = [(term['text'], term['score']) for term in response]\nprint(terms)\n```\n\nVectors\n-------\nThe semantics of terms are represented by \"vector\" objects, which this API\nwill return as inscrutable base64-encoded strings like this:\n\n    'WAB6AJG6kL_6D_6yAHE__R9kSAE8BlgKMo_80y8cCOCCSN-9oAQcABP_TMAFhAmMCUA'\n\nIf you want to look inside these vectors and compare them to each other,\ndownload our library called `pack64`, available as `pip install pack64`. It\nwill turn these into NumPy vectors, so it requires NumPy.\n\n```python\n>>> from pack64 import unpack64\n>>> unpack64('WAB6AJG6kL_6D_6y')\narray([ 0.00046539,  0.00222015, -0.08491898, -0.0014534 , -0.00127411], dtype=float32)\n```",
