    "description": "# Getting Inside The Box\n\nThis game was developed by the team [**Benevolent Bonobos**](#About-Us), during the [Summer Code Jam 2021](https://pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/8/) held by [Python Discord](https://discord.com/invite/python).\n\nTeams that participated in the code jam had to create a TUI based on the theme _Think Inside the Box_.\n\n[![Youtube Link](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/raw/main/images/thumbnail.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERME3fjnfFE \"Getting Inside The Box\")\n\n## Contents\n\n- [How To Play](#how-to-play)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n- [Future Improvements](#future-improvements)\n- [About Us](#about-us)\n\n<!--- This can go now that How To Play covers everything\n### Normal mode\n\n- with 9 levels\n\n### Infinite mode\n\n- with infinite levels\n- no ending\n- press `q` to quit --->\n\n## How To Play\n<!-- Insert the tutorial we made in the game here?-->\n<!-- The video goes here? -->\n1. There are 6 options in start menu:\n    - Start: Play the normal levels.\n    - Infinite: Never ending gameplay.\n    - Tutorial: How to play.\n    - Credits\n    - Leaderboard\n    - Quit\n2. Use **arrow keys** to move.\n3. On starting, a glimpse of the whole maze will be shown. After it disappears, the game will start.\n4. Player has to reach `&` with minimum collisions with the walls and in minimum time.\n5. Boxes:\n    - The place to stop and think.\n    - Will show the part of the maze associated with the box.\n    - Time slows down here.\n6. Echolocation:\n    - Press `e` to make a noise.\n    - An echo will come from the direction in which player last moved.\n    - The echo will get stronger the nearer the player is to the wall.\n7. Persistence:\n    - It acts as a score for a player.\n    - Higher is better.\n    - It will decrease with time.\n    - It will decrease more and more with each collision.\n    - Since time slows down in a box, persistence will decrease slower inside the box.\n    - It is visible in the top right corner.\n8. In the top left corner, the number of collisions made in the current level is visible.\n9. On pressing `q`, the game will be paused. There will be an option to _play again_ or _quit_.\n10. In normal mode, a player can play 9 levels.\n11. In infinite mode, a player will have to press `q` for quitting.\n12. After completing all normal levels, a player, if they want, can put their name in the _leaderboard_ which stores their score.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8.6 or greater\n- A stereo headset (for echolocation)\n- The terminal window should be sufficiently large (At least `50 x 15` characters in width and height). You should not resize the terminal during the game.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Windows\n\n```sh\npip install maze-gitb\n```\n\n### Linux\n\n```sh\npip3 install maze-gitb\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021.git\ncd summer-code-jam-2021\n```\n\n### 2. Install required dependencies\n\n#### Windows\n<!-- Not sure about Mac-->\n```sh\npip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n```sh\napt-get install openal-soft\npip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 3. Run the game\n\n#### Windows\n\n```sh\npython main.py\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n```sh\npython3 main.py\n```\n\n| Note: |\n| :--- |\n|The player should visit the _tutorial_ for a hands-on understanding of the game.|\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![First view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/blob/main/images/first_view.png?raw=true)\n\n![Box view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/raw/main/images/box_view.png?raw=true)\n\n![Box view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/blob/main/images/box_view3.png?raw=true)\n\n![Without box view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/raw/main/images/without_box.png?raw=true)\n\n![Box view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/blob/main/images/box_view2.png?raw=true)\n\n![Box view](https://github.com/Anand1310/summer-code-jam-2021/blob/main/images/gameplay.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Future Improvements\n\n- Reveal the map with animation at the start of the level.\n- Allow player to move during echo.\n- Fix bug: Hitting leaderboard in the main menu exits game. (This can be fixed with [this change](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/64eb2852514e91749fe706433363a8941d290d6c), we shall update the repo once the code jam finishes.)\n- Fix bug: Game background music does not start on tutorial. (This can also be fixed by [this commit.](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/a010bab5a2360cf26d99b25f5f185ef5a578b67d))\n- Add _Main menu_ option in pause menu. ([This](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/3368968c668307b36278629b75b02433fca18592) will do it)\n\n## About Us\n\n<!--Add your own github link here-->\n- [Anand](https://github.com/Anand1310)\n- [Pritam Dey](https://github.com/pritam-dey3)\n- [Himi](https://github.com/hizv)\n- [Olivia](https://github.com/OliviaVespera)\n- [StoneSteel](https://github.com/StoneSteel27)\n- [Jason Ho](https://github.com/Jason11ookJJ)\n\n\n",
