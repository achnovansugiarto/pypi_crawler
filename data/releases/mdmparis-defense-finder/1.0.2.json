    "description": "# Documentation DefenseFinder\n\nDefenseFinder is a program to systematically detect known anti-phage systems. DefenseFinder uses Macsyfinder.\n\nIf you are using DefenseFinder please cite\n\n- \"Systematic and quantitative view of the antiviral arsenal of prokaryotes\" bioRxiv\n  _Tesson F., Hervé A. , Touchon M., d’Humières C., Cury J., Bernheim A._\n- \"MacSyFinder: A Program to Mine Genomes for Molecular Systems with an Application to CRISPR-Cas Systems.\" PloS one 2014\n  _Abby S., Néron B.,Ménager H., Touchon M. Rocha EPC._\n\n## DefenseFinder Models\n\nThis repository contains MacSyFinder models allowing for a systematic search of anti-phage systems, that contribute to the DefenseFinder tool.\n\nThe repo is formatted according to [MacSyData guidelines](https://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeler_guide/index.html) and synchronized with [macsy-models repository](https://github.com/macsy-models) to be available in macsydata.\n\n# Installing DefenseFinder command line interface\n\n### Install dependency\n\nDefenseFinder has one program dependency:\nthe Hmmer program, version 3.1 or greater (http://hmmer.org/).\nThe hmmsearch program should be installed (e.g., in the PATH) in order to use MacSyFinder.\nDefenseFinder also relies on Python library dependencies:\n\n- macsyfinder\n- colorlog\n- pyyaml\n- packaging\n- networkx\n- These dependencies will be automatically retrieved and installed when using pip for installation (see below).\n\n### Install DefenseFinder\n\nDefenseFinder is installable through pip\nBefore starting, if you can, it is recommended to install DefenseFinder in a virtualenv (such as condas)\n\n```sh\nconda create –name defensefinder\nconda activate defensefinder\npip install mdmparis-defense-finder\n```\n\nBut you can just chose to install it wherever using pip\n\n```sh\npip install mdmparis-defense-finder\n```\n\nif at this stage you are running into issues, it is very often due to a problem with your pip installer. Check the following [webpage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49748063/pip-install-fails-for-every-package-could-not-find-a-version-that-satisfies/49748494#49748494) for details on how to solve it\n\nAfter installing DefenseFinder, you need to get the rules. Run the command\n\n```sh\ndefense-finder update\n```\n\n### Updating DefenseFinder\n\nIn general, before running DefenseFinder, make sure to get the most uptodate rules by running\n\n```sh\ndefense-finder update\n```\n\nIf you have an outdated version of DefenseFinder, you can use the following line to get the most uptodate version\n\n```sh\npip install -U mdmparis-defense-finder\ndefense-finder update\n```\n\n## Running Defense Finder\n\n### Quick run (typically on one genome)\n\n```sh\ndefense-finder run genome.faa\n```\n\n### Input.\n\nThe input file, here “genome.faa” has to be under the format of protein fasta, which should be “ordered”. Indeed DefenseFinder takes into account the order of the proteins.\n\nA run on a genome (few thousands proteins) should take less than two minutes on a standard laptop. If more,make sure everything is installed properly.\n\nATTENTION, for more than one genome/replicon, either run one genome at a time, or format the database as described in a following section. DefenseFinder will not work on a “big” multifasta not formatted as described.\n\n### Outputs\n\nDefenseFinder will generate two types of files (and one optional), detailed below as well as provides the results from macsyfinder. Everything will be stored in a defined folder.\n\n_defense_finder_systems.tsv_ : In this file, each line corresponds to a system found in the given genomes. This is a summary of what was found and gives the following information\n\n- type: Type of the anti-phage system found\n- subtype : Subtype of the anti-phage system found\n- sys_beg : Protein where the systems begins (name found in the fasta file)\n- sys_end : Protein where the systems ends (name found in the fasta file)\n- protein_in_syst Proteins founds in the systems (name found in the fasta file)\n- genes_count Number of genes found in the system\n- name_of_profiles_in_sys List of the protein profiles found in the system (name from the HMM)\n\n_defense_finder_genes.tsv_ : In this file, each line corresponds to a gene found in a system. This is a summary of what was found and gives the following information.\nThis follows MacsyFinder nomenclature (best_solution.tsv) and more can be found in the macsyfinder [documentation](https://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/index.html#running-macsyfinder).\n\n_defense_finder_hmmer.tsv_ : In this file, each line corresponds to a hit to any of the protein profiles involved in defense. Beware, a single protein can have several hits. This file is for a deep infection, of any proteins potentially linked to defense. However, biologically, it was shown that only a full system will be anti phage. So this should be interpreted with cautions.\n\n### Running DefenseFinder on several genomes\n\nWhen running DefenseFInder on several genomes, like Macsyfinder, we propose to adopt the following convention to fulfill the requirements for the “gembase db_type”.\n\nIt consists in providing for each protein, both the replicon name and a protein identifier separated by a “_” in the first field of fasta headers. “_” are accepted in the replicon name, but not in the protein identifier. Hence, the last “\\_” isthe separator between the replicon name and the protein identifier. As such, MacSyFinder will be able to treat eachreplicon separately to assess macromolecular systems’ presence.\n\n```sh\nExample: esco_genomes.faa\n> ESCO388_0001\nXXXXXXX\n> ESCO388_0002\nXXXXXXX\n…..\n> ESCO388_3603\nXXXXXXX\n> ESCO389_0001\nXXXXXXX\n> ESCO388_0002\nXXXXXXX\n> ESCO388_3555\nXXXXXXX\n```\n\nThen run\n\n```sh\ndefense-finder run –dbtype gembase esco_genomes.faa\n```\n\n## DefenseFinder options\n\nHelp\n\n```sh\ndefense-finder run --help\n```\n\ncore-macsyfinder options\n\n- -o, --out-dir\\_ TEXT The target directory where to store the results.Defaults to the current directory.\n- -w, --workers\\_ INTEGER The workers count. By default all cores will be used (w=0).\n- --db-type\\_ TEXT The macsyfinder --db-type option. Possible values are ordered\\*replicon, gembase, unordered, defaults to ordered\\*replicon. Run macsyfinder --help for more details\n- --preserve-raw Preserve raw MacsyFinder outputs alongside Defense Finder results inside the output directory.\n\nFor questions: you can contact aude.bernheim@inserm.fr\n\n\n",
