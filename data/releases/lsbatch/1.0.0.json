This allows developers to code and test Batch Jobs offline. It can also be used to prepare final deliverable that can uploaded to configure Batch Jobs in user's LeadSquared account.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAssuming that you have Python 3.7 and virtualenv installed, install `lsbatch`\n\n```bash\npip install lsbatch\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initiate a new Batch Job project\n\nTo create a new Batch Job in your local machine, execute the following command in cmd or shell:\n\n```bash\nlsbatch init\n```\n\nYou will be asked to provide name of this Batch Job\n\n```bash\n>Your Batch Job Name:\n```\n\nA new folder with the provided name will be created in the current directory. \nThis folder will be having all the libraries required for Batch Jobs local development.\nYou will find custom virtualenv in folder name `batch-virtualenv` with following default packages already installed\n\n* boto3==1.14.33\n* mysql-connector-python==8.0.21\n* pysftp==0.2.9\n* sendgrid==6.4.4\n* pandas==1.1.0\n* pyyaml==5.3.1\n* openpyxl==3.0.4\n* requests==2.24.0\n* tabulate==0.8.7\n* numpy==1.19.1\n\n*After initiating batch with `lsbatch init` ,  make sure all the following commands are executed at the project folder level*\n\n```bash\ncd {batch_job_folder_name}\n```\n\n# General rules for writing a Batch Job\n\n1. Your Batch Job folder should have a folder by name `src` which will used to write your actual code. This folder is automatically created during the `init` process\n2. User should keep their Batch Job files in 'src' folder only\n3. `src` folder should have `main.py` file that is basically the starting point of your application. By default this file is created with sample code during the `init process\n3. Your src folder may contain a requirements.txt file which can be used to provide any custom packages which you may require\n\n### Using inbuilt Batch Jobs function\n\nBatch Job provides various functions for comman tasks like logging, sending notification emails or making DB queries. `lsbatch` packs and mocks the same functions and are listed below:\n\n#### logging\n``` \nLS.log.info('Hello')\nLS.log.info('Hello', {\"Support Email\": \"support@leadsquared.com\"})\nLS.log.info(LS.settings.mykey)\nLS.log.debug('Debug Log Example')\nLS.log.error(type(err).__name__, traceback.format_exc())\nLS.log.fatal(type(err).__name__, traceback.format_exc())\n```\n#### using Variable\nUsed to store key/value pair with sensitive/private data. For example API key for some third party service or your SFTP password. It can be retrieved using following key\n``` \nLS.settings.<key_name>\n```\n\n#### Send Batch Job status notification email\n```\nLS.email.send_email_notification(<EmailType>, <Subject>, <EmailBody>, isHTML =<True/False>)\n```\nWhere\n* EmailType: one of \"Success\" or \"Failure\" which corresponds to success of failure of execution status\n* Subject: can be maximum 255 character, above which it will be trimmed\n* EmailBody: plain text or HTML content\n* isHTML: is an optional parameter with default value as True\n\n#### Making DB Calls\nYou can connect to your LeadSquared account database and well as ETL database. Use the following function to query the same\n```\nLS.db.execute_DB_query(<query>, multi=False)\nLS.db.execute_ETL_query(<query>, multi=False)\n```\nby default the function considers the query are single statement. For multiline query, pass `multi` parameter as `True`\n\n**Mocking DB query result**\nTo mock the DB result use the file `query.json` which is provided in the root project folder. It contains a json where \n* key is the DB query(exact - case sensitive) and \n* value is the csv file name that contains the result. \n\nYou will also find a `sample_query_result.csv` in project's root folder which is mapped as sample response in `query.json`.\n\nYou can create csv file by any name. Please note that this is purely for mocking purpose and does not evaluate the query, syntax or result in any way. Use the admin panel in your LeadSquared account to validate the same.\n\n###\tExecuting a Batch Job\n\nTo run Batch Job, run command `lsbatch run`\n\n```bash\nlsbatch run\n```\nThis will execute the code in context of virtual environment that has already been setup\n\n### Install LeadSquared Batch Job dependecies in current folder\n\nThe root folder already contains a `.gitignore` file that will commit only necessary files to your source code repository. Feel free to update the file as per your need. If you clone the repository, run the `lsbatch install` command inside the project directory to setup the Batch Job environment again. \n\n```bash\nlsbatch install\n```\nThis command can also be used in existing projects to reset the Batch Jobs environment at any time.\n\n> To run this command succesfully, current directory should have `src` that contains your code \n\n### Install your custom packages\n\n```bash\nlsbatch install {package_name}\n```\n\nThis installs your custom package to `batch-virtualenv` folder. Also it creates/updates a `requirements.txt` file inside `src` folder. `requirements.txt` file will be used to identify dependencies at the time of actual execution of the Batch Job\n\n### Packaging you project for deployement\n\nBatch Job accepts the deliverables as a zip file. To zip the project in correct way, execute the following command\n\n```bash\nlsbatch pack\n```\n\nThis will create zip deliverable in the project directory with same name as current folder. Remember to add this zip file to the `.gitignore` file in order to reduce the size of repository\n\n\n### Uninstall package\n\nTo uninstall a custom package, execute the following command\n\n```bash\nlsbatch uninstall {package_name}\n```\nThis will also remove the package name from `requirements.txt` file\n\n",
