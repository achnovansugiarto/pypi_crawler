    "description": ".. django-postman documentation master file, created by\n   sphinx-quickstart on Fri Nov 26 09:32:49 2010.\n   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least\n   contain the root `toctree` directive.\n\nWelcome to django-postman's documentation!\n==========================================\n\nThis is an application for `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_-powered websites.\n\nBasically, the purpose is to allow authenticated users of a site to exchange private **messages**\nwithin the site.  In this documentation, the word *user* is to be understood as an instance of a User,\nin the django.contrib.auth context.\n\nSo it is mainly for a User-to-User exchange.\nBut it may be beneficial for a subscriber to receive inquiries from any visitor, ie even if non authenticated.\nFor instance, a subscriber as a service provider wants an ask-me-details form on a presentation page\nto facilitate possible business contacts.\nIn this case, the visitor is presented a compose message form with an additional field to give\nan email address for the reply. The email is obfuscated to the recipient.\n\nWhat is a message ? Roughly a piece of text, about a subject, sent by a sender to a recipient.\nEach user has access to a collection of messages, stored in folders:\n\n    | **Inbox** for incoming messages\n    | **Sent** for sent messages\n    | **Archives** for archived messages\n    | **Trash** for messages marked as deleted\n\nIn folders, messages can be presented in two modes:\n\n* by **conversation**, for a compact view: the original message and its replies are grouped in a set\n  to constitute one sole entry.\n  The lastest message (based on the time) is the representative of the set.\n* by **message**, for an expanded view: each message is considered by itself.\n\nHere is a summary of features:\n\n* A non-User (email is undisclosed) can write to a User and get a reply\n  (can be disabled by configuration)\n* Exchanges can be moderated (with auto-accept and auto-reject plug-ins)\n* Optional recipient filter plug-ins\n* Optional exchange filtering plug-ins (blacklists)\n* Multi-recipient writing is possible (can be disabled by configuration)\n  with min/max constraints\n* Messages are managed by conversations\n* Messages in folders are sortable by sender|recipient|subject|date\n* 'Archives' folder in addition to classic Inbox, Sent and Trash folders\n* A Quick-Reply form to only ask for a response text\n* A cleanup management command to clear the old deleted messages\n\nIt has support for optional additional applications:\n\n* Autocomplete recipient field (default is 'django-ajax-selects'),\n  with multiple recipient management\n* New message notification (default is `django-notification`_)\n* Asynchronous mailer (default is `django-mailer`_)\n\n.. _`django-notification`: https://github.com/pinax/django-notification/\n.. _`django-mailer`: https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer/\n\nModeration\n----------\nAs an option, messages may need to be validated by a moderator before to be visible\nto the recipient.  Possible usages are:\n\n* to control there is no unwanted words in the text fields.\n* to make sure that no direct contact informations are exchanged when the site is an intermediary\n  and delivers services based on subscription fees.\n\nMessages are first created in a *pending* state. A moderator is in charge to change them to\na *rejected* or *accepted* state.  This operation can be done in two ways:\n\n* By a person, through the Admin site. A specially simplified change view is provided,\n  with one-click buttons to accept or reject the message.\n* Automatically, through one or more auto-moderator functions.\n\nFilters\n-------\nAs options, custom filters can disallow messages, in two ways:\n\n* **user filter**: a user is not in a state to act as a recipient\n* **exchange filter**: criteria for a message between a specific sender\n  and a specific recipient are not fulfilled",
