    "description": "# MemePy\n*Meme generator library for your everyday needs*\n\nPython meme generator originally made for the discord-chat-bot [HydroBot](https://github.com/julianbrandt/Hydrobot3), but migrated to its own package for increased modularity and ease of use.\n\n## How it works\n\nMemePy uses the Python Imaging Library *PIL* to edit existing templates of memes and return them to the user.\n\nMemePy has a list of defined `MemeImage` templates that are fed to a `MemeFactory`. The factory then produces an image with all the arguments, given by the user, pasted onto the image in the correct formats of the specific meme.\n\nIn addition to just text-based memes, MemePy also supports substituting the text-argument with an image. Just supply an image-link in `< ... >` angle brackets as an argument, and the text will be substituted for the image. ENDLESS POTENTIAL!!!\n\nThe available meme templates can be found in the [Image Library](Resources/ImageLibrary). The specifications of each meme template can be found in the [Meme Library](Resources/MemeLibrary). Where `builtin.JSON` is the place for default templates, and `extension.JSON` is where you can define your own templates.\n\n## Usage\n### Importing MemePy into your own project\n\nIf you wish to import the meme-generation functionality into your own project, usually all you will need can be found in [src.MemeGenerator.py](src/MemeGenerator.py). \n\n#### The functions available in this file are:\n\n* `save_meme_to_disk(template, path, args)`\n  * Generates a meme of the given template, with given args and saves it to disk at the given path.\n* `get_meme_image(template, args)`\n  * Generates a meme of the given template, with given args and returns it as a `PIL`Image object. Used if you wanna pass an image to your own project instead of saving it.\n* `get_meme_image_bytes(template, args)`\n  * Generates a meme of the given template, with given args and returns it as a BytesIO object. This allows for treating the output image as a file, and thus making it possible to open as other objects (e.g. `discord.py File` objects).\n* `get_meme_factory(template, args)`\n  * Generates a meme factory with the given template and args. This exposes more of the specifications of the factory, in case you need more rich details.\n\n## Creating memes on the Command-Line\n\nUsing the command-line, you can generate images from templates and save them to disk.\n\n#### Generating a meme:\n\n```console\nMemePy <path> <template> <*args> <*options>\n```\n\n- __path__ is where on your computer you want to save the meme.\n\n- __template__ is the underlying template to use for the meme.\n\n- __\\*args__ are all arguments to be placed onto the template (either texts or images).\n\n- __\\*options__ are the options that modify behavior of the generation.",
