Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation\nacross a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters\nof servers to mobile and edge devices.\n\nOriginally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team\nwithin Google's AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine\nlearning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used\nacross many other scientific domains.\n\n\n",

This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.TensorSummaryV2(\n  tag=np.array('test'),\n  tensor=np.array(3),\n  serialized_summary_metadata=tf.io.encode_base64(np.empty((0))))\n```\n\nThe code assumes `axis` is a scalar but there is no validation for this.\n\n```cc\n    const Tensor& serialized_summary_metadata_tensor = c->input(2);\n    // ...\n    ParseFromTString(serialized_summary_metadata_tensor.scalar<tstring>()(),\n                     v->mutable_metadata());\n``` \n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [290bb05c80c327ed74fae1d089f1001b1e2a4ef7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/290bb05c80c327ed74fae1d089f1001b1e2a4ef7).\n    \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n    \n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University and Hong Jin from Singapore Management University.",

      "details": "### Impact\nA malicious invalid input crashes a tensorflow model (Check Failed) and can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.\nTo minimize the bug, we built a simple single-layer TensorFlow model containing a Convolution3DTranspose layer, which works well with expected inputs and can be deployed in real-world systems. However, if we call the model with a malicious input which has a zero dimension, it gives Check Failed failure and crashes.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass MyModel(tf.keras.Model):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Convolution3DTranspose(2, [3,3,3], padding=\"same\")\n        \n    def call(self, input):\n        return self.conv(input)\nmodel = MyModel() # Defines a valid model.\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 32, 3], minval=0, maxval=0, dtype=tf.float32) # This is a valid input.\noutput = model.predict(x)\nprint(output.shape) # (1, 32, 32, 32, 2)\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 0, 3], dtype=tf.float32) # This is an invalid input.\noutput = model(x) # crash\n```\nThis Convolution3DTranspose layer is a very common API in modern neural networks. The ML models containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in\n- GitHub commit [948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2)\n- GitHub commit [85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commit/85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0.
