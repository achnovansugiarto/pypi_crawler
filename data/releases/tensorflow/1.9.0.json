This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/encode_png_op.cc#L57-L60) only validates that the total number of pixels in the image does not overflow. Thus, an attacker can send an empty matrix for encoding. However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated buffer is `nullptr`. Hence, when calling `png::WriteImageToBuffer`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/encode_png_op.cc#L79-L93), the first argument (i.e., `image.flat<T>().data()`) is `NULL`.

      "details": "In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.",

The MakeEdge function creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and the input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library.

This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a tf.float16 value. Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar tf.float16 value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions. This can be easily reproduced by tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16), if eager execution is enabled. This issue is patched in TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this vulnerability patched. TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected. Users are encouraged to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.",

First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument.

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.

Depending on the boolean value, one of the tensors is exactly the input tensor whereas the other one should be an empty tensor. However, the eager runtime traverses all tensors in the output. Since only one of the tensors is defined, the other one is `nullptr`, hence we are binding a reference to `nullptr`. This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with `-fsanitize=null`. In this case, this results in a segmentation fault The issue is patched in commit da8558533d925694483d2c136a9220d6d49d843c, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",

However, as soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault.\n\nThis is because the alocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the [needed virtual method](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7/tensorflow/core/framework/typed_allocator.h#L78-L85) is [not overriden](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acdf3c04fcfa767ae8d109b9e1f727ef050dba4d/tensorflow/core/kernels/immutable_constant_op.cc).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7) and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch.

If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.\n\nLater, these computed values [are used as arguments](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99) to [`GeneratePoolingSequence`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).

Thus, an attacker can send an empty matrix for encoding. However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated buffer is `nullptr`.

This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output.\n\nFurthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

      "details": "### Impact\nIn TensorFlow Lite, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.cc#L36\n\nHowever, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/c/common.h#L82\n\nThis results in special casing during validation at model loading time: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L566-L580\n\nUnfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays.\n\nThis results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). We will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nA potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",

Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Then, a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank:\n\n```cc\n  int64_t concat_dim;\n  if (concat_dim_t->dtype() == DT_INT32) {\n    concat_dim = static_cast<int64_t>(concat_dim_t->flat<int32>()(0));\n  } else {\n    concat_dim = concat_dim_t->flat<int64_t>()(0);\n  }\n\n  // Minimum required number of dimensions.\n  const int min_rank = concat_dim < 0 ? -concat_dim : concat_dim + 1;\n\n  // ...\n  ShapeHandle input = c->input(end_value_index - 1);\n  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRankAtLeast(input, min_rank, &input));\n```\n\nHowever, [`WithRankAtLeast`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L345-L358) receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented:\n\n```cc\nStatus InferenceContext::WithRankAtLeast(ShapeHandle shape, int64_t rank,\n                                         ShapeHandle* out) {\n  if (rank > kint32max) {\n    return errors::InvalidArgument(\"Rank cannot exceed kint32max\");\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nDue to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a [negative value](https://godbolt.org/z/Gcr5haMob), so the error check is bypassed.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [08d7b00c0a5a20926363849f611729f53f3ec022](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/08d7b00c0a5a20926363849f611729f53f3ec022).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved:\n\n```cc\nfunctor::BinaryFunctor<Device, Functor, 1>()(\n    eigen_device, out->template flat<Tout>(),\n    input_0.template flat<Tin>(), input_1.template flat<Tin>(),\n    error_ptr);\n```\nIf `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly.

The [`MakeEdge` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3616708cb866365301d8e67b43b32b46d94b08a0/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/graph_constructor.cc#L1426-L1438) creates an edge between one output tensor of the `src` node (given by `output_index`) and the input slot of the `dst` node (given by `input_index`). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding `DataType` values and comparing these for equality:\n\n```cc\n  DataType src_out = src->output_type(output_index);\n  DataType dst_in = dst->input_type(input_index);\n  //...\n```\n\nHowever, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays.\n\nIn most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [0cc38aaa4064fd9e79101994ce9872c6d91f816b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0cc38aaa4064fd9e79101994ce9872c6d91f816b) and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch.

However, if we call the model with a malicious input which has a zero dimension, it gives Check Failed failure and crashes.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass MyModel(tf.keras.Model):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Convolution3DTranspose(2, [3,3,3], padding=\"same\")\n        \n    def call(self, input):\n        return self.conv(input)\nmodel = MyModel() # Defines a valid model.\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 32, 3], minval=0, maxval=0, dtype=tf.float32) # This is a valid input.\noutput = model.predict(x)\nprint(output.shape) # (1, 32, 32, 32, 2)\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 0, 3], dtype=tf.float32) # This is an invalid input.\noutput = model(x) # crash\n```\nThis Convolution3DTranspose layer is a very common API in modern neural networks. The ML models containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in\n- GitHub commit [948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2)\n- GitHub commit [85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commit/85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0.
