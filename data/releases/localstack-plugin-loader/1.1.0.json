Each plugin has a namespace, a unique name in that namespace, and a `PluginFactory` (something that creates `Plugin` the spec is describing.\n  In the simplest case, that can just be the Plugin's class).\n* `Plugin`: an object that exposes a `should_load` and `load` method.\n  Note that it does not function as a domain object (it does not hold the plugins lifecycle state, like initialized, loaded, etc..., or other metadata of the Plugin)\n* `PluginFinder`: finds plugins, either at build time (by scanning the modules using `pkgutil` and `setuptools`) or at run time (reading entrypoints of the distribution using [stevedore](https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/))\n* `PluginManager`: manages the run time lifecycle of a Plugin, which has three states:\n  * resolved: the entrypoint pointing to the PluginSpec was imported and the `PluginSpec` instance was created\n  * init: the `PluginFactory` of the `PluginSpec` was successfully invoked\n  * loaded: the `load` method of the `Plugin` was successfully invoked\n\n![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localstack/localstack-plugin-loader/main/docs/localstack-plugin-loader-architecture.png)\n\n### Loading Plugins\n\nAt run time, a `PluginManager` uses a `PluginFinder` that in turn uses stevedore to scan the available entrypoints for things that look like a `PluginSpec`.\nWith `PluginManager.load(name: str)` or `PluginManager.load_all()`, plugins within the namespace that are discoverable in entrypoints can be loaded.\nIf an error occurs at any state of the lifecycle, the `PluginManager` informs the `PluginLifecycleListener` about it, but continues operating.\n\n### Discovering entrypoints\n\nAt build time (e.g., with `python setup.py develop/install/sdist`), a special `PluginFinder` collects anything that can be interpreted as a `PluginSpec`, and creates from it setuptools entrypoints.\nIn the `setup.py` we can use the `plugin.setuptools.load_entry_points` method to collect a dictionary for the `entry_points` value of `setup()`.\n\n```python\nfrom plugin.setuptools import load_entry_points\n\nsetup(\n    entry_points=load_entry_points(exclude=(\"tests\", \"tests.*\",))\n)\n```\n\nNote that `load_entry_points` will try to resolve a cached version of `entry_points.txt` from the `.egg-info` directory,\nto avoid resolving the entry points when building the package from a source distribution.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nTo build something using the plugin framework, you will first want to introduce a Plugin that does something when it is loaded.\nAnd then, at runtime, you need a component that uses the `PluginManager` to get those plugins.\n\n### One class per plugin\n\nThis is the way we went with `LocalstackCliPlugin`. Every plugin class (e.g., `ProCliPlugin`) is essentially a singleton.\nThis is easy, as the classes are discoverable as plugins.\nSimply create a Plugin class with a name and namespace and it will be discovered by the build time `PluginFinder`.\n\n```python\n\n# abstract case (not discovered at build time, missing name)\nclass CliPlugin(Plugin):\n    namespace = \"my.plugins.cli\"\n\n    def load(self, cli):\n        self.attach(cli)\n\n    def attach(self, cli):\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n# discovered at build time (has a namespace, name, and is a Plugin)\nclass MyCliPlugin(CliPlugin):\n    name = \"my\"\n\n    def attach(self, cli):\n        # ... attach commands to cli object\n\n```\n\nnow we need a `PluginManager` (which has a generic type) to load the plugins for us:\n\n```python\ncli = # ... needs to come from somewhere\n\nmanager: PluginManager[CliPlugin] = PluginManager(\"my.plugins.cli\", load_args=(cli,))\n\nplugins: List[CliPlugin] = manager.load_all()\n\n# todo: do stuff with the plugins, if you want/need\n#  in this example, we simply use the plugin mechanism to run a one-shot function (attach) on a load argument\n\n```\n\n### Re-usable plugins\n\nWhen you have lots of plugins that are structured in a similar way, we may not want to create a separate Plugin class\nfor each plugin. Instead we want to use the same `Plugin` class to do the same thing, but use several instances of it.\nThe `PluginFactory`, and the fact that `PluginSpec` instances defined at module level are discoverable (inpired\nby [pluggy](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy)), can be used to achieve that.\n\n```python\n\nclass ServicePlugin(Plugin):\n\n    def __init__(self, service_name):\n        self.service_name = service_name\n        self.service = None\n\n    def should_load(self):\n        return self.service_name in config.SERVICES\n\n    def load(self):\n        module = importlib.import_module(\"localstack.services.%s\" % self.service_name)\n        # suppose we define a convention that each service module has a Service class, like moto's `Backend`\n        self.service = module.Service()\n\ndef service_plugin_factory(name) -> PluginFactory:\n    def create():\n        return ServicePlugin(name)\n\n    return create\n\n# discoverable\ns3 = PluginSpec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"s3\", service_plugin_factory(\"s3\"))\n\n# discoverable\ndynamodb = PluginSpec(\"localstack.plugins.services\", \"dynamodb\", service_plugin_factory(\"dynamodb\"))\n\n# ... could be simplified with convenience framework code, but the principle will stay the same\n\n```\n\nThen we could use the `PluginManager` to build a Supervisor\n\n```python\n\nclass Supervisor:\n    manager: PluginManager[ServicePlugin]\n\n    def start(self, service_name):\n        plugin = manager.load(service_name)\n        service = plugin.service\n        service.start()\n\n```\n\n### Functions as plugins\n\nwith the `@plugin` decorator, you can expose functions as plugins. They will be wrapped by the framework\ninto `FunctionPlugin` instances, which satisfy both the contract of a Plugin, and that of the function.\n\n```python\nfrom plugin import plugin\n\n\n@plugin(namespace=\"localstack.configurators\")\ndef configure_logging(runtime):\n    logging.basicConfig(level=runtime.config.loglevel)\n\n\n@plugin(namespace=\"localstack.configurators\")\ndef configure_somethingelse(runtime):\n    # do other stuff with the runtime object\n    pass\n```\n\nWith a PluginManager via `load_all`, you receive the `FunctionPlugin` instances, that you can call like the functions\n\n```python\n\nruntime = LocalstackRuntime()\n\nfor configurator in PluginManager(\"localstack.configurators\").load_all():\n    configurator(runtime)\n```\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n    pip install localstack-plugin-loader\n\nDevelop\n-------\n\nCreate the virtual environment, install dependencies, and run tests\n\n    make venv\n    make test\n\nRun the code formatter\n\n    make format\n\nUpload the pypi package using twine\n\n    make upload\n\n\n",
