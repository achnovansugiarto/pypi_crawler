Install the dependencies:\n\n    `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`\n\n2. Clone the repo\n\n    `git clone https://github.com/NatTupper/dline`\n\n3. Find your discord \"token\"\n\n    * Go to http://discordapp.com/channels/@me\n\n    * Open your browser's developer console. (Normally `F12` or `CTRL-SHIFT-I`)\n\n    * Go into \"network\" and hit F5. Type \"v6\" in the filter field\n\n    * Filter by XHR and look through entries until you find \"authorization\" under \"request headers\". This is your token.\n\n    If all else fails, join the dev discord and we'll be glad to help!\n\n4. Run `dline --store-token` to store your token\n\n5. Run `dline --copy-skeleton` to get a template config\n\n6. Edit `~/.config/dline/config.yaml` to your choosing.\n\n7. Launch with `dline`\n\n\n### Current Features\n--------------------------\n\n* /channel to switch channel\n* /guild to switch guild\n* /nick to change nickname (per guild)\n* typing without a leading prefix will submit to current chat\n* \"<USER> is typing...\" support\n* private messaging\n* colored output, with user definable colors and custom roles\n* Channel logs update when users edit messages\n* /channels, /guilds, /users to view information\n* /game to update the \"Now playing: \" status\n* use /help to see more commands\n* unicode emoji displayal support\n* sending emojis in messages (unicode *and* custom)\n* File uploading via path (ex: /file /path/to/file)\n* italic, bold, and underline font support\n* inline \\`code\\` and \\`\\`\\`code\\`\\`\\` block support\n* URL detection, highlighting in blue + italics\n* automatic updating, fetching the latest master branch's commit\n* channel logs blink red upon unread messages\n* line scrolling\n* discord \"Nitro\" emojis\n* Externalized configs via YAML ~/.config/dline/config.yaml\n* @member expansion/mentions\n* /status to change online presence\n\n### Planned Features\n---------------------------\n\n* emoji reactions\n* comment editing and deletion\n* message searching\n\n## Dependencies\n------------------------\n\n* git (if you want automatic updates)\n* [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)\n* [blessings.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings/)\n* [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/)\n* [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe/)\n* asyncio\n\n**To install dependencies**:\n\n1. Download Python 3.5+ from the link above\n2. Install `pip3`, normally called `python3-pip` in package managers\n3. Download the dependencies using pip with the following command:\n\n    `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`\n\n\n### Color Customization\n------------------------\n\nAlmost all aspects of the client can be colored to\nthe user's wishes. You can set these colors from within\n`~/.config/dline/config.yaml`\n\nNote: These assume that you're using the standard terminal colors. If you\nhave colors already defined in your ~/.Xresources or similar, this will\nbe very confusing.\n\n## Launching\n------------------------\ndline uses git for automatic updates, so you must be within the dline\ndirectory upon starting. Manually you can launch via `python3.6 ./launcher.py`,\nhowever it is advised to create a helper script to do this for you.\n\n### A Note On Emojis\n-------------------------\n\nCurrently *most* of the standard unicode emojis\nare displaying. Note your terminal must be able\nto render these symbols *and* you must be using a font\nset that contains them. Because some of the emojis\nthat discord uses are non-standard, they may not\ndisplay properly. Here is an example of a random\nfew.\n\n![Image](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/iN52NdGOWqdWOxby88wiEGs8R81j33ndPjgKX8eKUNA/https/0x0.st/soIy.png?width=400&height=32)\n\nCustom emojis however, are displayed as :emoji_name:\n\n### Note On Font Support\n-------------------------\n\nLike emojis, not all terminals and fonts support\nitalic/bold/underline and 'background' colors, (which are used for \\`code\\`).\nIf these features aren't working for you, odds are you are not using a\nsupported terminal/font. Experiment with different setups to see what works.\n\n![Image](https://0x0.st/sHQ0.png)\n\n*Letting me know what setups __don't__ work helps a lot!*\n\n### Dude this is awesome! How can I support the project?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nStar it! ðŸŒŸ\n\nIt helps to get it higher in GitHub's search results as well as\nmaking me feel good inside. ;)\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, pull requests are __*always*__ welcome!\n\nIf you would like to get more info on what could be done or to discuss the\nproject in general, come join the discord guild at: https://discord.gg/rBGQMTk\n\n### FAQ\n-------------------------\n\n> Yet another discord cli?\n\nI didn't like any of the implementations I found around github. Too buggy.\nToo bloated. Bad UI. No customization. Some, after discord updates,\nno longer functioning at all.\n\n> Why use a token and not email/password?\n\nDiscord's API __does__ allow for email/pass login, but if you were to have\n2FA, (2 factor authentication), enabled on your account, Discord would\ninterpret this as a malicious attack against your account and disable it.\n\nSo, because *\"Nobody reads the readme\"*, I have disabled this.\n\n> How should I submit a GitHub issue?\n\nTry to include this format:\n\n```\nOS: Linux/Debian\nTerminal: urxvt\nFont: source code pro\nPython Version: 3.6\nHow to reproduce: xxxxxx\n```\n\n> It says my python is out of date even though I have 3.5+ installed?\n\nProbably because you have multiple versions installed. Try running with\n`python3.5` or `python3.6` rather than just \"python3\"\n\n> I'm getting weird encoding errors on startup\n\nYou probably don't have UTF-8 set. If you're using Linux,\nlook up how to do this according to your distro.\n\nIf you're on BSD, add this to your /etc/profile:\n\n```\nexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LESSCHARSET=utf-8\n```\n\nand make sure it gets sourced upon opening your terminal.\n\n### Misc Screenshots\n--------------------------\n\n![Image](images/screenshots/kingk22-screenshot.png)\n\n![Image](https://0x0.st/sH5g.png)\n\n![Image](https://0x0.st/sHjn.png)\n\nIt can even be configured to hide most elements of the UI in the config:\n\n![Image](images/screenshots/minimal_brown_ss.png)\n\n### Known Bugs\n--------------------------\n\n> My bug isn't listed here, how can I voice my problem?\n\nIf you have a specific issue that isn't listed here or in the\nwiki, post a github issue with a detailed explanation and I can\ntry to get it fixed. Join the discord if you want live help.\n\n### Token Warning\n-------------------------------\nDo *NOT* share your token with anybody, if someone else gets ahold\nof your token, they may control your account. If you are someone\nwho keeps their ~/.config on github, **add your token to your .gitignore**.\nOtherwise it will become public.\n\n\n### License\n-------------------------------\n\nLicensed under GNU-GPLv3\n\n\n### Legal Disclaimer\n--------------------------------\n\nDiscord hasn't put out any official statement on whether using their\nAPI for 3rd party clients is allowed or not. They *have* said that using\ntheir API to make \"self-bots\" is against their ToS. By self-bots, it is\nmy understanding they mean automating non-bot accounts as bots.\nMy code has no automated functions, or any on_events that provide features\nnot included in the official client.\n\nAs far as I know, nobody has been banned for using things like this before,\nbut Discord might one day change their mind. With this said, I take **no**\nresponsibility if this gets you banned.",
