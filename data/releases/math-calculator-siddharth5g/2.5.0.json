IF YOU ENTER 'NO' YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER AND OPERATOR, DEPENDING ON THE OPERATOR, THE FIRST NUMBER WILL BE REPLACED WITH THE ANSWER OF THE PREVIOUS CALCULATION.\nUNLESS YOU QUIT, THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK FOR AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT.\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n\nPROGRAM WILL DEFAULT TO TEXT BASED MATH CALCULATOR IN THE CASE OF ANY ERROR\nADDED SQUARE ROOT AS WELL AS PERCENT\nOVERHAULED GRAPHICAL CALCULATOR\nINPUT AND OUT WILL BE SHOWN IN DIFFERENT AREAS SO YOU CAN COPY YOUR INPUT EVEN AFTER GETTING THE OUTPUT, YOU CAN EDIT THE INPUT WITH YOU KEYBOARD BY CLICKING ON IT\nDARKMODE INTRODUCED TO GRAPHICAL CALULATOR\nTUTORIAL PAGE INTRODUCED\nYOU CAN CHOOSE IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESIZE THE WINDOW(BUTTONS DO NOT GET RESIZED SO RESIZING IS BUGGY, WILL GET FIXED IN A LATER VERSION)\nMENUBAR INTRODUCED CONTAINING ABOVE SETTINGS\n\n\n",
