    "description": "========================\nThe Machine Learning Hub\n========================\n\n**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe machine learning hub is an `open source project`_ aimed at easily\nsharing `pre-built machine learning models`_. The models are accessed\nand managed using the *ml* command from the *mlhub* package designed\nto install the model and run a demonstration within 5 minutes.  Each\nmodel has been tested on Ubuntu (GNU/Linux).\n\nVisit the `repository index`_ on `mlhub.ai`_ where the models\nthemselves can be browsed from the `main pool`_.\n\n.. _`open source project`: https://github.com/mlhubber/mlhub\n.. _`pre-built machine learning models`: https://github.com/mlhubber/mlmodels\n.. _`repository index`: https://mlhub.ai/Packages.html\n.. _`mlhub.ai`: https://mlhub.ai/\n.. _`main pool`: https://mlhub.ai/pool/main/\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nThe command line interface can be installed using `PyPi`_::\n\n  $ pip3 install mlhub\n  \nOnce installed you will be able to run the sample 'rain' model\nassuming that you have the free and open source `R statistical\nsoftware package`_ installed. The TL;DR version is below. Note that\nyou type the command ``ml ...`` and that everything from the ``#`` to\nthe end of the line is ignored (it's a comment)::\n\n  $ ml install   rain # Install the model named 'rain'.\n  $ ml demo      rain # Run the demonstration of the model\n  $ ml display   rain # Graphical display of pre-built model.\n\nThe following commands are available and below is a brief description\nof each command::\n\n  $ ml                # Show a usage message.\n  $ ml available      # List of pre-buld models on the MLHub.\n  $ ml installed      # List of pre-built models installed locally\n  $ ml install   rain # Install the model named 'rain'.\n  $ ml readme    rain # View background information about the model.\n  $ ml configure rain # Install required dependencies.\n  $ ml commands  rain # List of commands supported by the model.\n  $ ml demo      rain # Run the demonstration of the model\n  $ ml print     rain # Textual summary of the model.\n  $ ml display   rain # Graphical display of pre-built model.\n  $ ml score     rain # Run model on your own data.\n\nDifferent model packages will have different dependencies and these\nwill be installed by the *configure* command.\n  \n.. _`PyPi`: https://pypi.org/project/mlhub/\n.. _`R statistical software package`: https://cran.r-project.org\n\n\nQuick Start: Azure DSVM\n-----------------------\n\nA particularly attractive and simple way to get started with exploring\nthe mlhub functionality is to fire up a `Ubuntu Data Science Virtual\nMachine`_ (DSVM) on Azure for as little as USD10 per month for quite a\nsmall server or USD90 for a reasonable one.  You can get free credit\n(USD200) from Microsoft to `trial the DSVM`_.\n\nUsing this virtual machine will save a lot of time compared with\nsetting up your own machine with the required dependencies, which of\ncourse you can do if you wish as all the dependencies are open source.\n\nTo set up the virtual machine, with an Azure subscription log in to\nthe `portal`_ and add a new Data Science\nVirtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu). You need to provide a name (for\nthe virtual machine), a user name and a password, and then create a\nnew resource group and give it a name, and finally choose a\nlocation. Go with all the defaults for everything else, except choose\na size to suit the budget (B1s is cheap though a D2s is a better\ninteractive experience). Note that you are only charged whilst the\nmachine is fired up so USD90 per month is no where near what you will\nspend if you only fire up the server when you need.\n\nOnce the DSVM is set up go to its Overview page and click on DNS name\nConfigure and provide a name by which to refer to the server publicly\n(e.g., myml.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com).\n\nWe now have a server ready to showcase the pre-built Machine Learning\nmodels. There are several options to connect to the server but a\nrecommended one is to use `X2Go`_ which supports\nLinux, Windows, and Mac. Install it and point it to your server (e.g.,\nmyml.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com) in the setup.\n\nConnect to the DSVM.  Close the Firefox window that pops up. Click on\nthe terminal icon down the bottom, and you are ready to go::\n\n  $ pip install mlhub\n  $ ml\n  $ ml available\n\netc.\n\n.. _`Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine`: https://aka.ms/dsvm\n.. _`trial the DSVM`: https://aka.ms/free\n.. _`portal`: https://portal.azure.com/\n.. _`X2Go`: https://x2go.org/\n\n\nPre-Built Model Archives\n------------------------\n\nA model is a zip file archived as .mlm files and hosted in a\nrepository. The public repository is `mlhub.ai`_. The *ml* command can\ninstall the pre-built model locally, ready to run a demo, to print and\ndisplay the model, and to score new data using the model. Some models\nprovide ability to retrain the model with user provided data.\n\nContributing Models to ML Hub\n-----------------------------\n\nAnyone is welcome to contribute a pre-built model package to ML\nHub. Please submit a pull request through\n`github`_.\n\n.. _`github`: https://github.com/mlhubber\n\n\nInstalling Pip3\n---------------\n\nOn Ubuntu this is as simple as::\n\n  $ sudo apt install python3-pip\n\nAlternative pip Install\n-----------------------\n\nDepending on your setup of pip, you may need to use::\n\n  $ pip3 install mlhub\n\nThe executable may be placed into ``~/.local/bin`` which will need to\nbe on your path. Edit your shell startup which is either ``.profile``\nor ``.bashrc``, etc::\n\n  PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n  \nAlternative Install\n-------------------\n\nA tar.gz containing the mlhub package and the command line interface\nis available as `mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz`_ within the `distribution\nfolder`_ of the MLHub.\n\nTo install from the tar.gz file::\n  \n  $ wget https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz\n  $ pip install mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz\n  $ ml\n\nOr extract the above downloaded .tar.gz and install::\n\n  $ wget https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz\n  $ tar xvf mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz\n  $ cd mlhub\n  $ python3 setup.py install --user\n\n.. _`mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz`: https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_1.4.1.tar.gz\n.. _`distribution folder`: https://mlhub.ai/dist/\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nThe open source mlhub command line tool (ml) and sample models are\nbeing hosted on `github`_ and contributions to both the command line\ntool and contributions of new open source pre-built machine learning\nmodels are most welcome.
