    "description": "========================\nThe Machine Learning Hub\n========================\n\n**This site is under development.**\n\nThe machine learning hub is an open source project and resource for\ndistributing pre-built machine learning models. The models are\naccessed and managed using the *ml* command from the *mlhub* package.\n\nThe models collected in the ML Hub archive are listed in\n`<https://mlhub.ai/Packages.yaml>`_ and can be browsed from\n`<https://mlhub.ai/pool/>`_.\n\nThe command line tool source package is available as\n`<https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_1.0.12.tar.gz>`_ within\n`<https://mlhub.ai/dist/>`_\n\nTo install using PyPi::\n\n  $ pip install mlhub\n\nTo install from the tar.gz file::\n  \n  $ wget https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_1.0.12.tar.gz\n  $ pip install mlhub_1.0.12.tar.gz\n  $ ml\n\nOnce installed you will be able to run the sample rain-tomorrow\nmodel::\n\n  $ ml\n  $ ml available\n  $ ml installed\n  $ ml install   rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml readme    rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml license   rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml commands  rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml configure rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml demo      rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml print     rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml display   rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml score     rain-tomorrow\n  $ ml donate    rain-tomorrow\n  \nA model is a zip file archived as .mlm files and hosted in a\nrepository. The public repository is `<https://mlhub.ai>`_. The *ml*\ncommand can install the pre-built model locally, ready to run a demo,\nto print and display the model, and to score new data using the\nmodel. Some models provide ability to retrain the model with user\nprovided data.\n\nIf you find the model useful, either as is to score your own data or\nas a learning experience, please consider donating to the model's\nauthor through the **donate** command.\n\nThe open source mlhub command line tool (ml) and sample models are\nbeing hosted on `<https://github.com/mlhubber>`_ and contributoins to\nboth the command line tool and contributions of new open source\npre-built machine learning models are most welcome. Feel free to\nsubmit pull requests.",
