It doesn't need to modify or mod the original Minecraft server at all\n\nFrom in-game calculator, player high-light, to manipulate scoreboard, manage structure file and backup / load backup, you can implement these by using MCDR and related plugins\n\nGreat thanks to chino_desu and his [MCDaemon 1.0](https://github.com/kafuuchino-desu/MCDaemon) for the idea of such a cool Minecraft control tool\n\nContact me on discord: `Fallen_Breath#1215`\n\n## Advantage\n\n- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla\n- Hot-reloadable plugin system. You don't need to shut down the server to update the plugins\n- Multi platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows\n\n## How it works?\n\nMCDR uses [Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) to start the server as a sub-process, then it has the ability to control the standard input / out stream of the server\n\nSince the console output of a Minecraft server has a stable format and contains a large amount of useful information about the server, e.g. player chat messages, MCDR is able to parse and analyze the server output, abstract them into different events and dispatch them towards plugins for responding\n\nWith the help of Minecraft command system, MCDR can send Minecraft commands via the standard input stream to affect the actual Minecraft server\n\nThat's it, you can even think of MCDR as a robot that stares at the server console and can quickly respond to server output and input related commands if you like \n\n## Plugin\n\n[Here](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue) is a MCDR plugin collection repository\n\n## Document\n\nCheck https://mcdreforged.readthedocs.io/ for more details of MCDR\n\n\n",
