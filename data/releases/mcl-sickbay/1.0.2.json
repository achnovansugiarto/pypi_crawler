This section will help you get started.\n\n\n### 📀 The Database\n\nFor this project, we're using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). You can create a PostgreSQL database to use with this software as follows:\n\n```console\ndropdb --if-exists clinical_data\ndropuser --if-exists mcl\n\ncreateuser \\\n    --createdb \\\n    --inherit \\\n    --login \\\n    --no-createrole \\\n    --no-superuser \\\n    mcl\n\n\ncreatedb --encoding=UTF8 --owner=mcl clinical_data\n```\n\n\n### 🖥 The Software\n\nTo use this software, simply add `mcl.sickbay` as a dependency to your project or install it into your Python virtual environment.\n\nYou can develop, build, and test the package locally as follows:\n\n```console\npython3 bootstrap.py\nbin/buildout\nbin/test\n```\n\nYou can run `bin/create-demo-db` to populate a PostgreSQL database with the schema of the Sickbay data model. Add ``-add-test-data`` to include some test data.\n\nTo publish this software, try [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/).\n\n\n### 🔢 Versioning\n\nWe use the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) philosophy for versioning this software. For versions available, see the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/mcl.sickbay/#history).\n\n\n## 📦 Additional Resources\n\nSome resources that provide further context for this software are as follows:\n\n-   [Sample data, presentations, mockups, etc.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oXqRl-Aw2TSF70D9sPJaW99F9hyPiFHY?usp=sharing)\n-   [Common Data Elements](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/resources/standards/mcl-cdes)\n\n\n## 👥 Contributing\n\nWell it's wide open right now, but later you might look at [open issues](https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues), forking the project, and submitting a pull request.\n\n\n## 📃 License\n\nThe project is licensed under the [Apache version 2](LICENSE.txt) license.\n\n\n\n## 📜 Changelog\n\nThis documents the changes from release to release.\n\n\n### 1.0.2\n\nFor issue https://github.com/EDRN/MCL-metadata/issues/22\n\n-   Additional permissible value on `sequencing_platform` (enum `GenomicAnalyzer`), namely `illumina_hiseq_1500`.\n-   Changed the `read_length` from numeric to a string (10)\n-   Note that we do not have schema migrations set up so these steps must be run manually:\n    -   `ALTER TABLE \"genomics\" ALTER \"read_length\" SET DATA TYPE CHARACTER VARYING(10)`\n    -   `ALTER TYPE \"genomic_analyzier_enum\" ADD VALUE 'illumina_hiseq_1500' AFTER 'illumina_genome_analyzer_iix'`\n\n\n### 1.0.1\n\n- This version adds the human-readable label plus the token value to all enumerations over the JSON; see https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/16 for more information.\n\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n- A \"more official\" release.\n\n\n### 0.0.10\n\n\nFor issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/1:\n\n-   On `ClinicalCore`:\n    -   The `race` attribute is now a 1-to-many mapping to `CoreRace` via `core_races`\n    -   The `type_tobacco_used` is now a 1-to-many mapping to `CoreTobacco` via `core_tobaccos`\n    -   The attribute `days_to_birth` is now required\n-   On `Biospecimen`:\n    -   The enumeration for `Precancers` has a whole bunch of new permitted values\n-   On `BreastOrgan`:\n    -   The enumeration for `PrecancerousHistopathology` contains values for \"unknown\" and \"data not available\"\n    -   The enumeration for `BreastSite` now has an `unknown` value\n    -   A new value `pending` is available for `GeneticTestingAnswer`, `TestResults`, `EstrogenTestResults`\n    -   The enumeration `HER2Results` adds `pending` and `unknown` values\n    -   The enumeration `BreastImagingWorkup` adds an `unknown` value\n    -   The enumeration `BIRADSTissues` adds values for \"unknown\" and \"data not available\"\n-   New `LungOrgan` plus (bogus) test data for it\n-   New `PancreasOrgan` plus (bogus) test data for it\n-   Updated `ProstateOrgan`\n    -   Previously, this was just a placeholder to test multiple inheritance from the common `Organ` class in terms of both Python class hierachy and database hierarchy\n    -   Now it's completely filled out with the `v0` prostate common data elements with its numerous controlled vocabularies\n-   Expanded enumerations: `ClinicalMStage7`, `TStage7`, `ClinicalNStage7`, `GroupStage7`, `MarginalStatus`\n-   New enumerations, far too many to enumerate 😏\n\nFor issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/4:\n\n-   All fields in `LabCASMetadata` are now `String`.\n\nFor issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/3:\n\n-   `inscribed_clinicalCore_participant_ID` is a new field on `PriorLesion`, `CoreRace`, and `CoreTobacco`\n-   `inscribed_biospecimen_identifier` is a new field on `AdjacentSpecimen`\n\nFor issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/5:\n\n-   The following updates diverge from the [data dictionaries](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/resources/standards/mcl-cdes) of the common data elements:\n    -   `participant_ID` is now 50 characters (along with foreign keys and `inscribed` fields), up from 14\n    -   `specimen_ID` is now 50 characters (along with foreign keys and `inscribed` fields), up from 16\n\nAnd finally, for issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/6 … we add `unknown` to all enumerations that didn't have it already.\n\n\n\n### 0.0.9\n\n-   Rename `inscribed_participant_ID` → `inscribed_clinicalCore_participant_ID`\n-   Rename `inscribed_specimen_ID` → `inscribed_biospecimen_specimen_ID`\n\n\n### 0.0.8\n\n-   Addresses https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/2 by:\n    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` and `inscribed_specimen_ID` to `Genomics`\n    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` and `inscribed_specimen_ID` to `Imaging`\n    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` to `Biospecimen`\n    -   (It also adds some test data to these fields.)\n\n\n### 0.0.7\n\nIn this release:\n\n-   The `labcasFileURL` field is now just `labcasID`; everything else is the same except the name (and the semantics; it no longer is used to hold URLs)\n-   The `Organ` class now has an `inscribed_participant_ID` field you can use to note a future participant ID association with a `ClinicalCore`\n-   All enumerations now use [advanced enumerations](https://pypi.org/project/aenum/) for their base class.\n-   All enumerations now have a case-insensitive lookup.\n\nThe implications of that last bullet mean:\n\n```python\n>>> from mcl.sickbay.model.enums import Race\n>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race('Black or African American')\nTrue\n>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race['Black or African American']\nTrue\n>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race['black or african american']\nTrue\n>>> Race('black or african american')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nValueError: 'black or african american' is not a valid Race\n```\n\nSo if you want case-insensitive lookups, use brackets, not parentheses.\n\n\n### 0.0.6\n\nIn this release:\n\n-   Base metadata for all classes now includes:\n    -   `consortium`, a nullable string that can be used to contain an RDF URI to the consortium that originated the data, such as `https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/` for the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions.\n    -   `protocolID`, a nullable integer that tells the research protocol that generated the data.\n-   Kristen's sample data (`--add-sample-data`) includes these consortium and protocol IDs\n\n\n### 0.0.5\n\nThis release fixes:\n\n-   In `BreastOrgan`, the field `her2_in_situ_hybridization` was the wrong enumerated type. It should've been `HER2InSituHybridization`.\n-   In the enums, add the type `HER2InSituHybridization`.\n-   Add test data from `12_78_BreastCore_20200625_0`.\n-   Removed foreign key constraint from `Biospecimen.specimen_parent_ID` because the parent ID may be either another biospecimen or could be a participant (clinical core) object.\n-   New class `AdjacentSpecimen` to work around circular dependency problem of having adjacent specimens directly on `Biospeciment`.\n-   New JSON serialization for `adjacent_specimens` on `Biospecimen`\n-   Misspelled enumeration `AnatomicalSite`: `pancrease` → `pancreas`\n-   Change `create-demo-db` to `create-clinical-db` since this is no longer a demo but the real deal\n-   Transition from old style `setup.py` to everything in `setup.cfg`\n\nIn this release, 0.0.5, we also finally start keeping a changelog 😮\n\n\n",
