This settings are used to redirect to a specific url after hijacking or releasing the user. Default for both is the django `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`.\n\n    HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = \"/profile/\"  # where you want to be redirected to, after hijacking the user.\n    REVERSE_HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = \"/admin/\"  # where you want to be redirected to, after releasing the user.\n\n\nAdd the ``hijack`` URLs to your ``urls.py``\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        ...\n        url(r'^hijack/', include('hijack.urls')),\n    )\n\nTo work with `REMOTE_USER` just place `'hijack.middleware.HijackRemoteUserMiddleware',`\nbetween `django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware` and `django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware`\nin `settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`\n\n    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (\n        ...,\n        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n        'hijack.middleware.HijackRemoteUserMiddleware',\n        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware',\n        ...,\n    )\n\n\n## Usage and modes\n\nThere are different possibilities to hijack a user and communicate with users.\n\n###  Hijack using the 'Hijack Button' on the admin site\nGo to Users in the admin backend and push the `Hijack` button to hijack a user. This is the default mode and base version\nof django-hijack. To disable the `Hijack` button on the admin site (by not registrating the HijackUserAdmin) set ``SHOW_HIJACKUSER_IN_ADMIN = False`` in your project settings. If you are using a custom user model, you will have to add support for displaying the button yourself to your own `CustomUserAdmin`. Simply mix in the `hijack.admin.HijackUserAdminMixin`, and add `hijack_field` to `list_display`.\n\n\n### Hijack by calling URLs in the browser's address bar\nFor advanced superusers, users can be hijacked directly from the address bar by typing:\n\n* example.com/hijack/``user-id``\n* example.com/hijack/email/``email-address``\n* example.com/hijack/username/``username``\n\n### Specify which user attributes are allowed to hijack on\nBy default all of the above methods (user id, email and username) are allowed. If you want to allow only a subset of these\nyou can set ALLOWED_HIJACKING_USER_ATTRIBUTES in your project settings. This will disable the other endpoints.\nThe settings take a list of methods to allow, you can select\nfrom:\n\n* user_id\n* email\n* username\n\nNOTE: The link on the admin page will change in the order listed above. Say that you have enabled *username* and *email* then\nthe users email will be used for the hijack link in on the admin page.\n\n### Notify superusers when working behalf of another user\nThis option warns the superuser when working with another user as initally logged in. To activate this option perform\nthe following steps:\n\n* In your base.html add ``{% load hijack_tags %}``, ``{%  load staticfiles %}`` and\n* load the styles using ``<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{% static 'hijack/hijack-styles.css' %}\" />``.\n* Place ``{{ request|hijackNotification }}`` just after your opening body tag.\n* In your project settings add ``HIJACK_NOTIFY_ADMIN = True``. The default is True.\n* You need to add ``django.core.context_processors.request`` to your template context processors to be able to use requests and sessions in the templates.\n* Make sure that ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` is included in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n* Do not forget to run ``python manage.py collectstatic``.\n\n### Release/reverse hijack\n\nIn the visual notification for the superuser (or staff if ``ALLOW_STAFF_TO_HIJACKUSER`` is True), when working on behalf of other users, there\nis a link to release the hijacked user and switch back. After releasing you are redirected to `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` or to the URL defined in `REVERSE_HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`.\n\n    REVERSE_HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/admin/auth/user/'\n\nThe release/reverse hijack will be executed when the URL `/hijack/release-hijack/` is called (or whatever is linked to the URL with name = \"release_hijack\").\n\n#### Hijack history\nIf you (A) hijack a superuser (B) and then you hijack another user (C), the release will go backwards through the\n list of hijacked users one by one. After the first release you then are superuser (B), after the second you are superuser (A).\n\n\n\n### Notify users when they were hijacked\nNOTE: This use case is not fully implemented yet!\n\nThis option allows to notify and inform users when they were hijacked by a superuser. To activate this option\nfollow these steps:\n\n* In your base.html add ``{% load hijack_tags %}``, ``{%  load staticfiles %}`` and\n* load the styles using ``<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{% static 'hijack/hijack-styles.css' %}\" />``.\n* Place ``{{ request|hijackNotification }}`` just after your opening body tag.\n* In your project settings add ``HIJACK_NOTIFY_USER = True``. The default is False (= silent mode)\n* You need to add ``django.core.context_processors.request`` to your template context processors to be able to use requests and sessions in the templates.\n* Make sure that ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` is included in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n* Do not forget to run ``python manage.py collectstatic``.\n\n\n### Allow staff members to hijack other users\nThis option allows staff members to hijack other users. In your project settings set ``ALLOW_STAFF_TO_HIJACKUSER`` to ``True``. The default is False.\n\nStaff members are **not allowed** to hijack other staff members or admins/superusers.\n\nIf you want staff members to be able hijack other staff members you should set ``ALLOW_STAFF_TO_HIJACK_STAFF_USER`` to ``True``. The default is also False.\n\n\n### Custom hijack function\n\nThis feature gives you fine control over the hijack permissions system. In your project settings set ``CUSTOM_HIJACK_HANDLER`` to a dotted path referencing your function.\n\n    CUSTOM_HIJACK_HANDLER = 'path.to.my_custom_can_hijack_function'\n\nThen you can define your conditions to permit a user to hijack another one:\n\n    def my_custom_can_hijack_function(hijacker, hijacked):\n        if condition:\n            return True\n\n        return False\n\n\n### Django 1.4 - 1.8 compatibility with [django-compat](https://github.com/arteria/django-compat)\n\nAll critical imports are carried out with the [compat library](https://github.com/arteria/django-compat) that gives the compatibility for django 1.4 to 1.8\n\n### Support for custom user models\n\ndjango-hijack supports custom user models, all you need to do is to add the hijack button to your custom user `admin.py`. Import HijackUserAdminMixin from hijack admin and add ``hijack_field`` to your ``list_display``.\n\n    # .. imports ..\n    from hijack.admin import HijackUserAdminMixin\n\n    class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin, HijackUserAdminMixin):\n        # .. code ..\n        list_display = ('email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'is_staff', 'hijack_field')\n\n## Settings\n\nAll configuration settings with their default value and description\n\n    # Hijack button in admin user view; default = True\n    SHOW_HIJACKUSER_IN_ADMIN = True\n    \n    # Notification for the admin if he is working for an other user; default = True\n    HIJACK_NOTIFY_ADMIN = True\n    \n    # Allow staff users to hijack; default = False\n    ALLOW_STAFF_TO_HIJACKUSER = False\n\n    # Allow staff users to hijack other staff users; default = False\n    ALLOW_STAFF_TO_HIJACK_STAFF_USER = False\n    \n    # Where to go when you hijack someone; default equals the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL; which has the default '/accounts/profile/'\n    REVERSE_HIJACK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL\n    \n    # Which methods of hijacking a user is allowed; default = ('user_id', 'email', 'username')\n    ALLOWED_HIJACKING_USER_ATTRIBUTES = ('user_id', 'email', 'username')\n\n    # Define a custom function to determine which user can hijack another user\n    CUSTOM_HIJACK_HANDLER = 'path.to.my_custom_can_hijack_function'\n\n## Signals\n\n### Superuser logs in\nYou can catch a signal when a superuser logs in as another user. Here is an example:\n\n    from django.dispatch import receiver\n    from signals import post_superuser_login\n\n    @receiver(post_superuser_login)\n    def set_superuser(sender, **kwargs):\n        print \"Superuser hijacked userID %s\" % kwargs['user_id']\n\n\n# TODOs, issues and planned features\n* Handle hijack using URLs on non unique email addresses.\n* unset_superuser example for signals\n* Store info in user's profile (see #3 comments, Use case: 'Notify users when they were hijacked', see above)\n* \"got it\" Link in notification to remove notification and flag from session. This is useful if hijack is used to switch between users and ``HIJACK_NOTIFY_ADMIN`` is True.\n* Support for named URLs for the hijack button.\n* Handle signals in ``release_hijack(..)``, currently the signals are only triggered in ``login_user(..)`` and ``logout_user(..)``.\n* Graceful support for custom user models that do not feature username / email\n\n\n## FAQ, troubleshooting and hints\n\n### Why does the hijack button not show up in the admin site, even if I set ``SHOW_HIJACKUSER_IN_ADMIN = True`` in my project settings?\n\nIf your ``UserAdmin`` object is already registered in the admin site through another app (here is an example of a Facebook profile, https://github.com/philippeowagner/django_facebook_oauth/blob/master/facebook/admin.py#L8), you could disable the registration of django-hijack by settings ``SHOW_HIJACKUSER_IN_ADMIN = False`` in your project settings.\n\nAfterwards create a new ``UserAdmin`` class derived from ``HijackUserAdmin``. The Facebook example would look like this:\n\n\n    from django.contrib import admin\n    from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\n    from hijack.admin import HijackUserAdmin\n\n    from .models import FacebookProfile\n\n    # We want to display our facebook profile, not the default user's profile\n    admin.site.unregister(User)\n\n    class FacebookProfileInline(admin.StackedInline):\n        model = FacebookProfile\n\n    class FacebookProfileAdmin(HijackUserAdmin):\n        inlines = [FacebookProfileInline]\n\n    admin.site.register(User, FacebookProfileAdmin)\n\n\n## Similar projects\n\nSimilar projects can be found and compared in the [user-switching](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/user-switching/) or the [support gird](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/support-apps/) of djangopackages.\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project, simply send us a pull request.
