This includes a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to run\nMail2Beyond as a standalone server, as well as a Python package that you can use to extend or integrate into your own\napplications. \n\n## Installation\nTo install Mail2Beyond, simply run the following command:\n```\npip install mail2beyond\n```\n\n## Usage\nBefore starting the Mail2Beyond server, you must \n[create your configuration file](https://soluna-studios.github.io/mail2beyond/index.html#configuration). Once you have\nyour configuration file ready, you can start the server by running:\n```\nmail2beyond --config /path/to/your/config.yml\n```\n\n## Developer Documentation\n- [API Reference](https://soluna-studios.github.io/mail2beyond/)\n\n## How is This Useful? \nEmails are often ignored due to the amount of spam we receive on a daily basis. Many systems and applications use SMTP\nto send mail alerts, notices and other information that may be important. This commonly causes important information to\nbe overlooked or outright ignored. At the same time, many organizations are using real-time messaging services like\nGoogle Chat and Slack on a daily basis. Mail2Beyond allows you to redirect these important messages to these services\nto help keep your teams informed!\n\nBeyond messaging services, Mail2Beyond can also be extended to include connectors to your own APIs to build out complex\nautomation flows based on incoming SMTP messages.\n\n## How Does Mail2Beyond Work?\nMail2Beyond continually listens for incoming SMTP messages. When a message is received, the message is parsed and checked\nagainst a set of admin configured mappings that dictate which API connector is to be used. Mappings define which SMTP \nheaders should be checked for a specific regular expression match. When a match is found, the email contents are parsed\nand sent to the upstream API using the connector specified in the mapping.\n",
