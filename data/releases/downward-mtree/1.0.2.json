    "description": "# D-MTree (Downward-MTree)\n\nThis library implements a datastructure very similar to the MTree datastructure in pure python (for more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-tree)\n\nThe main difference is that the split of a NonLeafNode (inner node) will not propagate to the parent node, but instead \ncreates a new subtree with the two closest routing objects as descendants. \n* This has the advantage that the covering-radii of the NonLeafNodes have the least overlap.\n* The disadvantage is that if the points are added in an unlucky order, the depth of the tree can grow very fast!\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return abs(p1 - p2)\n\ndmtree = DMTree(distance_measure=distance, leaf_node_capacity=10, inner_node_capacity=5)\n\n# inserting 1000 values with equal identifier:\nfor i in range(1000):\n    dmtree.insert(identifier=i, value=i)     \n\n# search in radius and order them by distance (ascending):\nelements = dmtree.find_in_radius(value=50.5, radius=1)\n\n# find the 10 nearest neighbours and order them by distance (ascending):\n# the parameter 'truncate' decides if the results is trimmed to exactly k if there are multiple elements with the same distance\nelements = dmtree.knn(value=50.5, k=10, truncate=True)\n\n# deleting entries\nfor identifier in range(1000):\n    dmtree.remove(identifier)\n```\n* identifier should be a datatype that can be compared with ==, <=, >=, <, >\n* mtree.knn(value, k, truncate=True) is equal to mtree.knn(value, k, truncate=False)[:k]\n\n## Parameters\n| Parameter                 | Description                                                                           | \n| -------------:            |:-------------                                                                         | \n| distance_measure          | Custom distance method that fulfills the  triangle inequality                         | \n| leaf_node_capacity        | The number of children a NonLeafNode can hold before it is split (>=2) Default=50     |  \n| inner_node_capacity       | The number of objects a LeafNode can hold before it is split  (>=2)  Default=20       |\n| split_method              | The algorithm that splits overflowing LeafNodes Default='max_distance'                |    \n\n## Split methods\n| Parameter                 | Description                                                                           | \n| -------------:            |:-------------                                                                         | \n| random        | Choose two random elements of the LeafNode as new routing objects                                 | \n| min_sum_radii | Choose the two elements of the LeafNode that minimizes the sum of the resulting radii             |  \n| max_distance  | Choose the two elements of the LeafNode that maximizes the distance between the routing values    |\n\n## Best practice\n* When inserting the values, do so in a randomized order, or the resulting tree can very quickly become heavily unbalanced\n\n",
