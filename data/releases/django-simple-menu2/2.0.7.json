    "description": "Simple Django Menus 2\n=====================\n\ndjango-simple-menu is an entirely code based menu system, because, who\nreally wants to define their menus in the django admin...\n\nIt's simple to use yet provides enough flexibility to provide unlimited\nchildren menus, per-request generation and checking of menu items, badges,\nand more.\n\nIt was built from scratch over the past 3 years as part of an internal\nsystem after we were not satisifed by all of the existing menu apps.\n\nFork\n----\n\nThis is the fork of the original project. Mainly because the original\nproject is broken for pip requirements.txt using projects. Hopefully\nwe can put this fork to rest as soon as possible ;-)\n\nPatches from:\n\n - boekooi https://github.com/fatbox/django-simple-menu/pull/14\n - diegotoral https://github.com/fatbox/django-simple-menu/pull/13\n - tomleo https://github.com/fatbox/django-simple-menu/pull/12\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe documentation is located in the docs directory and can be viewed at:\n\nhttps://django-simple-menu.readthedocs.org\n\nRequirements\n------------\nDjango 1.3+",
