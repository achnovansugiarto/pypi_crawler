Often, a lot of basic\ninformation is shared between domains (name, mail or web servers, anti-spam\nconfiguration etc.). `CNAME`s can help to keep information in a single location,\nbut are not compatible e.g. with information stored at the apex (the domain name\nitelf), and thus are of limited or no use for the above-mentioned shared\ninformation. When creating a new zone, a previous zone can be copied; however,\nif later things have to change for these domains, a lot of manual labor is\nrequired, prone to errors. DNS Temple tries to simplify this.\n\n# Motivating example\n\n## Traditional setup\n\nMain site:\n\n```bind\n$ORIGIN\t\texample.com.\n$TTL\t\t86400\n@\t\tSOA\t(ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. 2020121901 3600 1800 2419200 300)\n\t\tNS\tns1.example.com.\n\t\tNS\tns2.example.com.\n\t\tMX\t10 mail.example.com.\n\t\tTXT\t\"v=spf1 mx ~all\"\n\t\tTXT\t\"google-site-verification=zeePiegahyeiVoh4SheiK5ootees2Uy4DaiKawoh\"\n\t\tA\t192.0.2.80\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::80\n\t\tCAA\t0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\"\nns1\t\tA\t203.0.113.53\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1:2::53\nns2\t\tA\t198.51.100.53\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:3:4::53\n# Web\nwww\t\tA\t192.0.2.80\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::80\n# Mail\nautodiscover\tCNAME\tmail\nautoconfig\tCNAME\tmail\nmail\t\tA\t192.0.2.25\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::25\nsmtp\t\tCNAME\tmail\nimap\t\tCNAME\tmail\ndkim._domainkey\tTXT\t\"v=DKIM1;k=rsa;t=s;s=email;p=MII...\"\n_dmarc\t\tTXT\t\"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dkim@example.com; fo=1:d:s\"\n# Cloud\ncloud\t\tA\t192.0.2.90\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::90\n```\n\nOne of many secondary sites:\n\n```bind\n$ORIGIN\t\texample.ch.\n$TTL\t\t86400\n@\t\tSOA\t(ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. 2020121901 3600 1800 2419200 300)\n\t\tNS\tns1.example.com.\n\t\tNS\tns2.example.com.\n\t\tMX\t10 mail.example.com.\n\t\tTXT\t\"v=spf1 mx ~all\"\n\t\tTXT\t\"google-site-verification=isei8oox1gahc7oox1ezith9eith2ki8aigh9aiD\"\n\t\tA\t192.0.2.80\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::80\n\t\tCAA\t0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\"\n# Web\nwww\t\tA\t192.0.2.80\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::80\n# Mail\nautodiscover\tCNAME\tmail\nautoconfig\tCNAME\tmail\nmail\t\tA\t192.0.2.25\n\t\tAAAA\t2001:db8:1234:5678::25\nsmtp\t\tCNAME\tmail\nimap\t\tCNAME\tmail\ndkim._domainkey\tTXT\t\"v=DKIM1;k=rsa;t=s;s=email;p=MII...\"\n_dmarc\t\tTXT\t\"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dkim@example.com; fo=1:d:s\"\n```\n\nThe `mail`, `_dkim`, and `www` entries could be changed to `CNAME`s and the SPF\nentry could use `include:`, but many problems would still remain, such as:\n\n1. Changing the address of the web server would require changing all the files\n   anyway.\n1. Changing the list of name servers, certificate authorities, or mail servers\n   cause modification of every file.\n1. `SOA` serials need to be incremented carefully to avoid hard-to-diagnose\n   problems.\n1. Adding an additional service, such as a secondary mail server, CardDAV,\n   CalDAV, or XMPP would require touching every file.\n1. Over time, files will diverge, due to some services (such as cloud) appearing\n   in some zones only or authentication entries (such as\n   `google-site-verification`, maybe `_domainkey`) differing between domains.\n1. You will lose oversight because of all the clutter and differences.\n\n## Configuration with DNS Temple\n\nCreate a central configuration where shared information is collected:\n\n```yaml\naddresses:\n  ns1:     203.0.113.53  2001:db8:1:2::53\n  ns2:     198.51.100.53 2001:db8:3:4::53\n  mail:    192.0.2.25    2001:db8:1234:5678::25\n  web:     192.0.2.80    2001:db8:1234:5678::80\n  cloud:   192.0.2.90    2001:db8:1234:5678::90\nvariables:\n  ca:      letsencrypt.org\n  dkimkey: |\n  \"MII...\"\n```\n\nCreate a set of templates using `{variable}` references, `$ADDRESS` explosions\n(expanding dynamically to a set of `A` and `AAAA` records), `$INCLUDE`s, and\n`$DEFAULT` values for some variables using magic `{_domain}` and `{_serial}`\nvariables:\n\n- `header.t`:\n\n```bind\n$ORIGIN\t\t{_domain}\n$TTL\t\t86400\n@\t\tSOA\t(ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. {_serial} 3600 1800 2419200 300)\n\t\tNS\tns1.example.com.\n\t\tNS\tns2.example.com.\n\t\tCAA\t0 issue \"{ca}\"\n```\n\n- `mail.t`:\n\n```bind\n$DEFAULT\t\t\tdomain\t{_domain}.\n$ADDRESS\t\t\tmail\tmail\n\n{domain}\t\t\tMX\t10 mail.example.com.\n\t\t\t\tTXT\t\"v=spf1 mx ~all\"\nautodiscover.{domain}\t\tCNAME\tmail\nautoconfig.{domain}\t\tCNAME\tmail\nsmtp.{domain}\t\t\tCNAME\tmail\nimap.{domain}\t\t\tCNAME\tmail\ndkim._domainkey.{domain}\tTXT\t\"v=DKIM1;k=rsa;t=s;s=email;p={dkimkey}\"\n_dmarc.{domain}\t\t\tTXT\t\"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dkim@example.com; fo=1:d:s\"\n```\n\n- `web.t`:\n\n```bind\n$ADDRESS\tweb\t@\n$ADDRESS\tweb\twww\n```\n\n- `common.t`:\n\n```bind\n$INCLUDE\theader.t\n$INCLUDE\tmail.t\n$INCLUDE\tweb.t\n```\n\nThese configuration templates will be shared among the zones, resulting in much\nmore compact files:\n\n```bind\n$INCLUDE\tcommon.t\n$INCLUDE\tmail.t\tdomain=noreply\n$ADDRESS\tns1\tns1\n$ADDRESS\tns2\tns2\n$ADDRESS\tcloud\tcloud\n@\t\tTXT\t\"google-site-verification=zeePiegahyeiVoh4SheiK5ootees2Uy4DaiKawoh\"\n```\n\n```bind\n$INCLUDE\tcommon.t\n$ADDRESS\tns1\tns1\n$ADDRESS\tns2\tns2\n$ADDRESS\tcloud\tcloud\n@\t\tTXT\t\"google-site-verification=isei8oox1gahc7oox1ezith9eith2ki8aigh9aiD\"\n```\n\n# Syntax\n\nThe BIND syntax is augmented to achieve the power of variables, modules, and\nfunctions. The changes, however, are minimal, to retain familiarity.\n\nBehind the scenes, _scoped variables_ and _include parameters_ do all the work:\nEach `$INCLUDE` creates a new context, initialized with the variables of the\nparent file and the parameters passed in the `$INCLUDE` statement.\n\nThe new or extended statements are:\n\n- `$DEFAULT`: Setting default values for variables,\n- `$INCLUDE`: Create a child context and include the file, and\n- `$ADDRESS`: Simplify the handling of addresses, whether IPv4, IPv6 or groups\n  thereof.\n\n## Configuration file\n\nThe configuration file is structured as follows:\n\n```yaml\nconfig:\n  serial: <`online`|`dateserial`|`unixtime`|any integer>\n  skip: <comma-separated list of `empty`, `comment`>\nextensions:\n  in: <extension on input file names>\n  out: <extension for output file names>\naddresses:\n  <name1>: <addresses1…>\n  <name2>: <addresses2…>\n  ...\nvariables:\n  <name1>: <value1>\n  <name2>: <value2>\n  ...\n```\n\n`skip` suppresses the output of empty and/or comment lines (_starting_ with\n`;`).\n\nThe `in` extension is removed from the input file names, if present, and the\n`out` extension is appended. The basename is also used to set the `_domain`\nvariable, below.\n\nSerial number modes are as follows:\n\n- `online`: Queries the name servers and increments; but uses at least the value\n  that `dateserial` would produce. For this, existing `SOA` serials are obtained\n  by querying the local resolver and an authoritative name server. Highest\n  priority for authoritative name server is given to the _master name_ (`MNAME`)\n  extracted from the `SOA` record returned by the local resolver, with the\n  remaining `NS` entries as fallbacks. The minimum SOA corresponds to what\n  `date -u +%Y%m%d00` would return.\n- `dateserial`: Uses the `YYYYMMDD00` format\n- `unixtime` (default): Uses the current second since start of the epoch\n- An integer, e.g. `1`: Use this integer as the serial number\n\n## Variables\n\nVariable names in curly brackets (`{}`) are expanded directly when reading the\nline from the input file (the entire Python `format()` specification is\nsupported). Only after that, lines are parsed; i.e., whitespace or quotes have\nno special significance to `dnstemple` and cannot be escaped (at least as of\nnow).\n\nThe following special variables are automatically set:\n\n- `_config`: The file name the YAML configuration has been read from.\n- `_domain`: The domain name, as determined by the basename of the top-level\n  file, i.e., the file specified on the command line, after removing the `in`\n  extension.\n- `_serial`: A serial number usable for the `SOA` record.\n\nAll variable names starting with `_` are reserved.\n\n## Addresses\n\nOne of the important reasons for using `dnstemple` is to make addressing more\ndynamic. This is similar to a variable, but with extra possibilities:\n\n- Be able to change addresses in multiple zone files, even if `CNAME`s are not\n  possible (e.g., at the apex)\n- Reduce inter-zone dependencies: Have the same address in multiple zones,\n  without causing multiple lookups (i.e., follow the `CNAME`) when resolving or\n  requiring the other zone to be ready.\n- Handle IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using the same syntax (no deciding between `A`\n  and `AAAA`)\n- Support multiple addresses for a name (IPv4+IPv6, but also multiple of each)\n  without having to add/drop lines in the zone file\n\nAddresses are defined similar to variables, but with the following distinctions:\n\n- They are defined in the `address` block\n- They are used with the `$ADDRESS` directive, which expands them into any\n  number of `A` and `AAAA` records, as appropriate\n- They can be defined recursively, e.g. for fail-over/load-balancing setups:\n\n  ```yaml\n  addresses:\n    server1: 192.0.2.11 2001:db8:1234:5678::11\n    server2: 192.0.2.12\n    farm: server1 server2\n  ```\n\n  There is no need to use variable notation. Anything not an IPv4 or IPv6\n  address will be recursively looked up as an address, up to 5 levels deep.\n\n  Of course, variables could also be included using the standard `{}` variable\n  notation, but then the reference is to the `variables` section.\n\n## Directives\n\n### `$INCLUDE <file> [<var>=<value>…]`\n\nInclude the given file. The set of variables available to the included file is\nthe set of variables available to the parent, plus the variables passed as\nparameters. This is similar to how parameters would be passed to functions.\n\nSeparation is done at all whitespace, after variable substitution, without\nconsideration of quotes or escape characters. So do not try to include\nwhitespace into variable values.\n\n### `$ADDRESS <address> <prefix>`\n\nCreate one line for each of the addresses listed for the named address parameter\nspecified in the configuration file. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be mixed\narbitrarily and will be prefixed with `A` or `AAAA`, as appropriate. Typically,\nthe prefix will just be a name, but can also contain TTL information; in fact,\nanything that could precede the `A` or `AAAA`.\n\n### `$DEFAULT <variable> <value>`\n\nIf the specified variable is undefined or empty, set it to the value given.\n",
