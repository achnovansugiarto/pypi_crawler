    "description": "=====\nUsage\n=====\n\nUsing EMAIL_BACKEND\n===================\n\nThis is the preferred and easiest way to use django-mailer.\n\nTo automatically switch all your mail to use django-mailer, first set\nEMAIL_BACKEND::\n\n    EMAIL_BACKEND = \"mailer.backend.DbBackend\"\n\nIf you were previously using a non-default EMAIL_BACKEND, you need to configure\nthe MAILER_EMAIL_BACKEND setting, so that django-mailer knows how to actually send\nthe mail::\n\n    MAILER_EMAIL_BACKEND = \"your.actual.EmailBackend\"\n\nNow, just use the normal `Django mail functions\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/>`_ for sending email. These\nfunctions will store mail on a queue in the database, which must be sent as\nbelow.\n\nExplicitly putting mail on the queue\n====================================\n\nIf you don't want to send all email through django-mailer, you can send mail\nusing ``mailer.send_mail``, which has the same signature as Django's\n``send_mail`` function.\n\nYou can also do the following::\n\n    # favour django-mailer but fall back to django.core.mail\n    from django.conf import settings\n\n    if \"mailer\" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:\n        from mailer import send_mail\n    else:\n        from django.core.mail import send_mail\n\nand then just call send_mail like you normally would in Django::\n\n    send_mail(subject, message_body, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, recipients)\n\nThere is also a convenience function ``mailer.send_html_mail`` for creating HTML\n(this function is **not** in Django)::\n\n    send_html_mail(subject, message_plaintext, message_html, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, recipients)\n\nAdditionally you can send all the admins as specified in the ``ADMIN``\nsetting by calling::\n\n    mail_admins(subject, message_body)\n\nor all managers as defined in the ``MANAGERS`` setting by calling::\n\n    mail_managers(subject, message_body)\n\nClear queue with command extensions\n===================================\n\nWith mailer in your INSTALLED_APPS, there will be two new manage.py commands\nyou can run:\n\n* ``send_mail`` will clear the current message queue. If there are any\n  failures, they will be marked deferred and will not be attempted again by\n  ``send_mail``.\n\n* ``retry_deferred`` will move any deferred mail back into the normal queue\n  (so it will be attempted again on the next ``send_mail``).\n\nYou may want to set these up via cron to run regularly::\n\n\n    *       * * * * (/path/to/your/python /path/to/your/manage.py send_mail >> ~/cron_mail.log 2>&1)\n    0,20,40 * * * * (/path/to/your/python /path/to/your/manage.py retry_deferred >> ~/cron_mail_deferred.log 2>&1)\n\nFor use in Pinax, for example, that might look like::\n\n    * * * * * (cd $PINAX; /usr/local/bin/python2.5 manage.py send_mail >> $PINAX/cron_mail.log 2>&1)\n    0,20,40 * * * * (cd $PINAX; /usr/local/bin/python2.5 manage.py retry_deferred >> $PINAX/cron_mail_deferred.log 2>&1)\n\nThis attempts to send mail every minute with a retry on failure every 20 minutes.\n\n``manage.py send_mail`` uses a lock file in case clearing the queue takes\nlonger than the interval between calling ``manage.py send_mail``.\n\nNote that if your project lives inside a virtualenv, you also have to execute\nthis command from the virtualenv. The same, naturally, applies also if you're\nexecuting it with cron. The `Pinax documentation`_ explains that in more\ndetails.\n\n.. _pinax documentation: http://pinaxproject.com/docs/dev/deployment.html#sending-mail-and-notices\n\n===================\nUsing EMAIL_BACKEND\n===================\n\nTo automatically switch all your mail to use django-mailer, instead of changing imports\nyou can also use the EMAIL_BACKEND feature that was introduced in Django 1.2. In\nyour settings file, you first have to set EMAIL_BACKEND::\n\n    EMAIL_BACKEND = \"mailer.backend.DbBackend\"\n\nIf you were previously using a non-default EMAIL_BACKEND, you need to configure\nthe MAILER_EMAIL_BACKEND setting, so that django-mailer knows how to actually send\nthe mail::\n\n    MAILER_EMAIL_BACKEND = \"your.actual.EmailBackend\"\n\nControlling the delivery process\n================================\n\nIf you wish to have a finer control over the delivery process, which defaults\nto deliver everything in the queue, you can use the following 3 variables\n(default values shown)::\n\n    MAILER_EMAIL_MAX_BATCH = None  # integer or None\n    MAILER_EMAIL_MAX_DEFERRED = None  # integer or None\n    MAILER_EMAIL_THROTTLE = 0  # passed to time.sleep()\n\nThese control how many emails are sent successfully before stopping the\ncurrent run `MAILER_EMAIL_MAX_BATCH`, after how many failed/deferred emails\nshould it stop `MAILER_EMAIL_MAX_DEFERRED` and how much time to wait between\neach email `MAILER_EMAIL_THROTTLE`.\n\nUnprocessed emails will be evaluated in the following delivery iterations.\n\n\nChange log\n==========\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\n* Deprecated calling ``send_mail`` and ``send_html_mail`` using ``priority``\n  kwargs ``\"high\"``, ``\"medium\"``, and ``\"low\"``. Instead you should use\n  ``PRIORITY_HIGH``, ``PRIORITY_MEDIUM`` and ``PRIORITY_LOW`` from\n  ``mailer.models``.\n\n* Fixed bug with migrations for Django 1.7, which wanted to create a migration\n  to 'fix' the EmailField length back down to 75 instead of 254.\n\n\n1.0.1\n-----\n\n* Included migrations - for both South and Django 1.7 native migrations.\n\n  Note:\n\n  * If you use South, you will need at least South 1.0\n  * You will need to use '--fake' or '--fake-initial' on existing installations.\n\n  These migrations were supposed to be in 1.0.0 but were omitted due to a\n  packaging error.\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\n* Throttling of email sending\n* Django 1.8 support\n* Admin tweaks and improvements\n* Various other fixes, especially from Renato Alves <alves.rjc@gmail.com> - thank you!\n\n0.1.0\n-----\n\n* First PyPI version",
