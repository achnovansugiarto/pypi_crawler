    "description": "MDT - The Mendel Development Tool\n=================================\n\n## What is this?\n\nMDT is a simple tool to aid in working with single board computers that the\nMendel Linux distribution runs on. It consists of a whole bunch of pre-existing\nopen source tooling, coupled with some simple wrappers written in python to ease\ntheir use.\n\nIt also provides an easy way to interact with these boards without having to\nfight with serial consoles, IP addresses, and other fiddly bits, reducing\nbarrier to entry when working with these boards.\n\nWith minimal effort, MDT should also be portable to existing systems such as\nDebian and Ubuntu, if needed. This, however, is out of the scope of this\nproject.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nInstall it via pip like this:\n\n```\npip install mendel-development-tool\n```\n\nNote that if you run this as a non-root user, the executable will be stored in\n`$HOME/.local/bin` which may not be in your PATH environment variable, so you'll\nwant to add it.\n\n\n",
