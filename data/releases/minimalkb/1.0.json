    "description": "minimalKB\n=========\n\n![Screenshot of a minimalKB knowledge model viewed with oro-view](doc/oroview.jpg)\n\nminimalKB is a SQLite-backed minimalistic knowledge base, initially designed\nfor robots (in particular human-robot interaction or multi-robot interaction).\n\nIt stores triples (like RDF/OWL triples), and provides a mostly conformant\n[KB-API](http://homepages.laas.fr/slemaign/wiki/doku.php?id=kb_api_robotics)\nAPI accessible via a simple socket protocol.\n\n[pykb](https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/pykb) provides an idiomatic Python\nbinding, making easy to integrate the knowledge base in your applications.\n\nIt has almost no features, except it is fast and simple. Basic RDFS reasoning\nis provided (cf below for details).\n\nWritten in Python. The only required dependency is `sqlite3`. If `rdflib` is\nalso available, you can easily import existing ontologies in RDF/OWL/n3/Turtle\nformats in the knowledge base.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**minimalkb only supports Python 3**\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/minimalkb.git\n$ cd minimalkb\n$ python setup.py install\n$ minimalkb\n```\n\nRun `minimalkb --help` for available options.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Server-Client or embedded\n\n`minimalKB` can be run as a stand-alone (socket) server, or directly embedded\nin Python applications.\n\n### Multi-models\n\n`minimalKB` is intended for dynamic environments, with possibly several\ncontexts/agents requiring separate knowledge models.\n\nNew models can be created at any time and each operation (like knowledge\naddition/retractation/query) can operate on a specific subset of models.\n\nEach models are also independently classified by the reasoner.\n\n### Event system\n\n`minimalKB` provides a mechanism to *subscribe* to some conditions (like: an\ninstance of a given type is added to the knowledge base, some statement becomes\ntrue, etc.) and get notified back.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n`minimalKB` only provides basic RDFS/OWL reasoning capabilities:\n\n- it honors the transitive closure of the `rdfs:subClassOf` relation.\n- functional predicates (child of `owl:functionalProperty`) are properly\n  handled when updating the model (ie, if `<S P O>` is asserted with `P` a\n  functional predicate, updating the model with `<S P O'>` will first cause `<S\n  P O>` to be retracted).\n- `owl:equivalentClass` is properly handled.\n\nThe reasoner runs in its own thread, and classify the model at a given rate, by\ndefault 5Hz. It is thus needed to wait ~200ms before the results of the\nclassification become visible in the model.\n\n### Transient knowledge\n\n`minimalKB` allows to attach 'lifespans' to statements: after a given duration,\nthey are automatically collected.\n\n### Ontology walking\n\n`minimalKB` exposes several methods to explore the different ontological models\nof the knowledge base. It is compatible with the visualization tool\n[oro-view](https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/oro-view).",
