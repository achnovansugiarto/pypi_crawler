    "description": "# Dotabase\n\n[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dotabase.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/dotabase/)\n[![Dota Version](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdiller/dotabase/master/DOTA_VERSION)](http://www.dota2.com/)\n\nAn sqlite database representing much of the data from dota2's game files, and an sqlalchemy representation to be used with it. This was built using my [dotabase-builder](https://github.com/mdiller/dotabase-builder) project.\n\n## Description\nThe goal of this project is to provide an interface into dota's game files so that applications can be built around them. This repository will be kept up to date with dota so that changes to the game are available immediately. \nOne main feature of this project that I couldn't find anywhere else, is a representation of dota's Hero Response system. This is the system that controls the various vocal responses that heroes have to actions that are happening in the game. \nIn addition to supplying a sqlite database, this project includes a python sqlalchemy representation of the database, which provides an easy way to interface with python applications. (dotabase.py) It also happens to be a good file to look at if you want to get an idea of the structure of the database\nNOTE: This project does not supply any player information or data from specific dota games. There are plenty of [already](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=47115 \"Dota 2 Match History API\") [existing](https://steamcommunity.com/dev \"Steam Web API\") [API](http://docs.opendota.com/ \"OpenDota/Yasp API\")s for that.\n\n## Installation\nTo start using the database, simply clone this repository and use any of the wide variety of ways to interface with the sqlite dotabase.db file.\n\nIf you want to use the dotabase package in your python applications, you can install via pip like this:\n```\npip install dotabase\n```\n\nExample Usage:\n```python\nfrom dotabase import *\n\nsession = dotabase_session()\n\nfor hero in session.query(Hero):\n\tprint(hero)\n```\nNote that the package was built using python 3.5 and sqlalchemy 1.1\n\n## JSON files\n\nIn the `json` directory, I've auto-generated a bunch of json files that give you an idea of what is inside the database. These are also useful for seeing the difference between builds.\n\n## Builder\nThe database is built using my custom [dotabase-builder](https://github.com/mdiller/dotabase-builder \"Dotabase Builder\"). Check it out for more information of how this project is being constructed.\n\n## Extracted VPK Files\nThe files extracted from dota's vpk are all of the ones of the following types:\n- txt\n- png\n- mp3 (extracted from vsnd_c files)\n\nMore file types will be added later",
