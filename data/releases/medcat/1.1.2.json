Paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165). \n\n## News\n- **New Release \\[1. August 2021\\]**: Upgraded MedCAT to use spaCy v3, new scispaCy models have to be downloaded - all old CDBs will work without any changes.\n- **New Feature and Tutorial \\[8. July 2021\\]**: [Integrating ðŸ¤— Transformers with MedCAT for biomedical NER+L](https://towardsdatascience.com/integrating-transformers-with-medcat-for-biomedical-ner-l-8869c76762a)\n- **General \\[1. April 2021\\]**: MedCAT is upgraded to v1, unforunately this introduces breaking changes with older models (MedCAT v0.4), \nas well as potential problems with all code that used the MedCAT package. MedCAT v0.4 is available on the legacy \nbranch and will still be supported until 1. July 2021 \n(with respect to potential bug fixes), after it will still be available but not updated anymore.\n- **Paper**: [Whatâ€™s in a Summary? Laying the Groundwork for Advances in Hospital-Course Summarization](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.naacl-main.382.pdf)\n- ([more...](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/blob/master/media/news.md))\n\n## Demo\nA demo application is available at [MedCAT](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk). This was trained on MIMIC-III and all of SNOMED-CT.\n\n## Tutorial\nA guide on how to use MedCAT is available in the [tutorial](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/tree/master/tutorial) folder. Read more about MedCAT on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/medcat-introduction-analyzing-electronic-health-records-e1c420afa13a).\n\n## Related Projects\n- [MedCATtrainer](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtrainer/) - an interface for building, improving and customising a given Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+L) model (MedCAT) for biomedical domain text.\n- [MedCATservice](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATservice) - implements the MedCAT NLP application as a service behind a REST API.\n- [iCAT](https://github.com/CogStack/iCAT) - A docker container for CogStack/MedCAT/HuggingFace development in isolated environments.\n\n## Install using PIP (Requires Python 3.6+)\n0. Upgrade pip `pip install --upgrade pip`\n1. Install MedCAT \n- For macOS/linux: `pip install --upgrade medcat`\n- For Windows (see [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)): `pip install --upgrade medcat -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`\n\n2. Get the scispacy models:\n\n`pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.4.0/en_core_sci_md-0.4.0.tar.gz`\nor\n`pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.4.0/en_core_sci_lg-0.4.0.tar.gz`\n\n3. Downlad the Vocabulary and CDB from the Models section bellow\n\n4. Quickstart:\n```python\nfrom medcat.vocab import Vocab\nfrom medcat.cdb import CDB\nfrom medcat.cat import CAT\n\n# Load the vocab model you downloaded\nvocab = Vocab.load(vocab_path)\n# Load the cdb model you downloaded\ncdb = CDB.load('<path to the cdb file>') \n\n# Create cat - each cdb comes with a config that was used\n#to train it. You can change that config in any way you want, before or after creating cat.\ncat = CAT(cdb=cdb, config=cdb.config, vocab=vocab)\n\n# Test it\ntext = \"My simple document with kidney failure\"\ndoc_spacy = cat(text)\n# Print detected entities\nprint(doc_spacy.ents)\n\n# Or to get an array of entities, this will return much more information\n#and usually easier to use unless you know a lot about spaCy\ndoc = cat.get_entities(text)\nprint(doc)\n\n\n# To train on one example\n_ = cat(text, do_train=True)\n\n# To train on a iterator over documents\ndata_iterator = <your iterator>\ncat.train(data_iterator)\n\n#Once done, save the new CDB\ncat.cdb.save(<save path>)\n```\n\n### MetaCAT example\n```python\nfrom medcat.meta_cat import MetaCAT\n# Assume we have a CDB and Vocab object from before\n# Download the mc_status model from the models section below and unzip it\n\nmc_status = MetaCAT.load(\"<path to the unziped mc_status directory>\")\ncat = CAT(cdb=cdb, config=cdb.config, vocab=vocab, meta_cats=[mc_status])\n\n# Now annotate a document, it will have the meta annotation 'status'\ndoc = cat.get_entities(text)\n```\n\n\n## Models\nA basic trained model is made public for the vocabulary and CDB. It is trained for the ~ 35K concepts available in `MedMentions`. \n\nVocabulary [Download](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/media/vocab.dat) - Built from MedMentions\n\nCDB [Download](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/media/cdb-medmen-v1.dat) - Built from MedMentions\n\nMetaCAT Status [Download](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/media/mc_status.zip) - Built from a sample from MIMIC-III, detects is an annotation Affirmed (Positve) or Other (Negated or Hypothetical)\n\n\n(Note: This was compiled from MedMentions and does not have any data from [NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) as\nthat data is not publicaly available.)\n\n### SNOMED-CT and UMLS\nIf you have access to UMLS or SNOMED-CT and can provide some proof (a screenshot of the [UMLS profile page](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov//uts.html#profile) is perfect, feel free to redact all information you do not want to share), contact us - we are happy to share the pre-built CDB and Vocab for those databases. \n\n\n## Acknowledgement\nEntity extraction was trained on [MedMentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions) In total it has ~ 35K entites from UMLS\n\nThe vocabulary was compiled from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) In total ~ 800K unique words\n\n\n## Powered By\nA big thank you goes to [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - who made life a million times easier.\n\n\n## Citation\n```\n@ARTICLE{Kraljevic2021-ln,\n  title=\"Multi-domain clinical natural language processing with {MedCAT}: The Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit\",\n  author=\"Kraljevic, Zeljko and Searle, Thomas and Shek, Anthony and Roguski, Lukasz and Noor, Kawsar and Bean, Daniel and Mascio, Aurelie and Zhu, Leilei and Folarin, Amos A and Roberts, Angus and Bendayan, Rebecca and Richardson, Mark P and Stewart, Robert and Shah, Anoop D and Wong, Wai Keong and Ibrahim, Zina and Teo, James T and Dobson, Richard J B\",\n  journal=\"Artif.
