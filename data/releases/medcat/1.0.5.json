    "description": "# Medical  <img src=\"https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/blob/master/media/cat-logo.png\" width=45> oncept Annotation Tool\n\nMedCAT can be used to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and link it to biomedical ontologies like SNOMED-CT and UMLS. Preprint [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165). \n\n## UPDATE\nMedCAT is upgraded to v1, unforunately this introduces breaking changes with older models (MedCAT v0.4), as well as potential problems with all code that used the MedCAT package.\n\nMedCAT v0.4 is available on the [legacy](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/tree/legacy) branch and will still be supported until 1. July 2021 (with respect to potential bug fixes), after it will still be available but not updated anymore.\n\n## Demo\nA demo application is available at [MedCAT](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk). Please note that this was trained on MedMentions\nand contains a small portion of UMLS.\n\n## Tutorial [NOT YET v1 READY]\nA guide on how to use MedCAT is available in the [tutorial](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/tree/master/tutorial) folder. Read more about MedCAT on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/medcat-introduction-analyzing-electronic-health-records-e1c420afa13a).\n\n## Papers that use MedCAT\n- [Treatment with ACE-inhibitors is not associated with early severe SARS-Covid-19 infection in a multi-site UK acute Hospital Trust](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340261837_Treatment_with_ACE-inhibitors_is_not_associated_with_early_severe_SARS-Covid-19_infection_in_a_multi-site_UK_acute_Hospital_Trust)\n- [Supplementing the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) for anticipating early deterioration among patients with COVID-19 infection](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078006v1)\n- [Comparative Analysis of Text Classification Approaches in Electronic Health Records](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341396173_Comparative_Analysis_of_Text_Classification_Approaches_in_Electronic_Health_Records)\n- [Experimental Evaluation and Development of a Silver-Standard for the MIMIC-III Clinical Coding Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07332)\n\n## Related Projects\n- [MedCATtrainer](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtrainer/) - an interface for building, improving and customising a given Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+L) model (MedCAT) for biomedical domain text.\n- [MedCATservice](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATservice) - implements the MedCAT NLP application as a service behind a REST API.\n- [iCAT](https://github.com/CogStack/iCAT) - A docker container for CogStack/MedCAT/HuggingFace development in isolated environments.\n\n## Install using PIP (Requires Python 3.6.1+)\n1. Install MedCAT \n\n`pip install --upgrade medcat`\n\n2. Get the scispacy models:\n\n`pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.3.0/en_core_sci_md-0.3.0.tar.gz`\n\n3. Downlad the Vocabulary and CDB from the Models section bellow\n\n4. Quickstart:\n```python\nfrom medcat.vocab import Vocab\nfrom medcat.cdb import CDB\nfrom medcat.cat import CAT\n\n# Load the vocab model you downloaded\nvocab = Vocab.load(vocab_path)\n# Load the cdb model you downloaded\ncdb = CDB.load('<path to the cdb file>') \n\n# Create cat - each cdb comes with a config that was used\n#to train it. You can change that config in any way you want, before or after creating cat.\ncat = CAT(cdb=cdb, config=cdb.config, vocab=vocab)\n\n# Test it\ntext = \"My simple document with kidney failure\"\ndoc_spacy = cat(text)\n# Print detected entities\nprint(doc_spacy.ents)\n\n# Or to get an array of entities, this will return much more information\n#and usually easier to use unless you know a lot about spaCy\ndoc = cat.get_entities(text)\nprint(doc)\n\n\n# To train on one example\n_ = cat(text, do_train=True)\n\n# To train on a iterator over documents\ndata_iterator = <your iterator>\ncat.train(data_iterator)\n\n#Once done, save the new CDB\ncat.cdb.save(<save path>)\n```\n\n\n## Models\nA basic trained model is made public for the vocabulary and CDB. It is trained for the ~ 35K concepts available in `MedMentions`. \n\nVocabulary [Download](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/zkcl/vocab.dat) - Built from MedMentions\n\nCDB [Download](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/zkcl/cdb-medmen-v1.dat) - Built from MedMentions\n\n\n(Note: This is was compiled from MedMentions and does not have any data from [NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) as\nthat data is not publicaly available.)\n\n### SNOMED-CT and UMLS\nIf you have access to UMLS or SNOMED-CT and can provide some proof (a screenshot of the [UMLS profile page](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov//uts.html#profile) is perfect, feel free to redact all information you do not want to share), contact us - we are happy to share the pre-built CDB and Vocab for those databases. \n\n\n## TODO\n- [ ] Update the tutorials\n- [ ] Switch to spaCy version 3+\n- [ ] Enable automatic download of pre-built UMLS/SNOMED databases\n- [ ] Enable spaCy serialization of documents (problem with `doc._.ents`)\n- [ ] Update webapp to v1 and enable UMLS and SNOMED\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\nEntity extraction was trained on [MedMentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions) In total it has ~ 35K entites from UMLS\n\nThe vocabulary was compiled from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) In total ~ 800K unique words\n\n\n## Powered By\nA big thank you goes to [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - who made life a million times easier.\n\n\n## Citation\n```\n@misc{kraljevic2020multidomain,\n      title={Multi-domain Clinical Natural Language Processing with MedCAT: the Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit}, \n      author={Zeljko Kraljevic and Thomas Searle and Anthony Shek and Lukasz Roguski and Kawsar Noor and Daniel Bean and Aurelie Mascio and Leilei Zhu and Amos A Folarin and Angus Roberts and Rebecca Bendayan and Mark P Richardson and Robert Stewart and Anoop D Shah and Wai Keong Wong and Zina Ibrahim and James T Teo and Richard JB Dobson},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2010.01165},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n\n\n",
