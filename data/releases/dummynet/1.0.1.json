By dummy-networks we refer to setups with network namespaces, virtual\nethernets, etc.\n\nThe Dummynet class is a python wrapper for the linux 'ip netns' and 'ip link'\ntools. The methods of the class parse args directly to the command-line in your\nlinux OS.\n\nSo far, Ubuntu and Debian are supported, but please make sure, that you\nhave the iproute2 linux-package installed with::\n\n    apt-get install iproute2\n\nOther Linux operating systems have not been tested, but feel free to open an\nissue if support is needed.\n\n.. contents:: Table of Contents:\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install dummynet-python::\n\n    pip install dummynet-python\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n::\n\n    import dummynet\n\n    def main():\n\n        with dummynet.host() as shell:\n\n            demo0 = shell.netns_add(name=\"namespace1\")\n            demo1 = shell.netns_add(name=\"namespace2\")\n\n            shell.link_veth_add(p1_name=\"peer1\", p2_name=\"peer2\")\n\nFor a complete example of a local network setup see the test in\n'test/test_dummynet.py'.\n\nYou can try playing around with the class methods in dummynet.py and call the\ncommands in self.shell.run(cmd) from the command-line. This can give a better\nidea of the functionality.\n\n\nRelease new version\n===================\n\n1. Edit NEWS.rst and wscript (set correct VERSION)\n2. Run ::\n\n    ./waf upload\n\nSource code\n===========\n\nThe main functionality is found in ``src/dummy_net.py`` and the\ncorresponding unit test is in ``test/test_dummynet.py`` if you\nwant to play/modify/fix the code this would, in most cases, be the place\nto start.\n\nDeveloper Notes\n===============\n\nWe try to make our projects as independent as possible of a local system setup.\nFor example with our native code (C/C++) we compile as much as possible from\nsource, since this makes us independent of what is currently installed\n(libraries etc.) on a specific machine.\n\nTo \"fetch\" sources we use Waf (https://waf.io/) augmented with dependency\nresolution capabilities: https://github.com/steinwurf/waf\n\nThe goal is to enable a work-flow where running::\n\n    ./waf configure\n    ./waf build --run_tests\n\nConfigures, builds and runs any available tests for a given project, such that\nyou as a developer can start hacking at the code.\n\nFor Python project this is a bit unconventional, but we think it works well.\n\nTests\n=====\n\nThe tests will run automatically by passing ``--run_tests`` to waf::\n\n    ./waf --run_tests\n\nThis follows what seems to be \"best practice\" advise, namely to install the\npackage in editable mode in a virtualenv.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\n* Why use an ``src`` folder (https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/).\n  tl;dr you should run your tests in the same environment as your users would\n  run your code. So by placing the source files in a non-importable folder you\n  avoid accidentally having access to resources not added to the Python\n  package your users will install...\n* Python packaging guide: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/\n\n\n\n",
