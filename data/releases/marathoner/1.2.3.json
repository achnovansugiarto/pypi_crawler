    "description": "Marathoner\n==========\n\nMarathoner is a command line tool for effective local testing of solutions for [Marathon Match competitions](http://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewActiveContests) organized by [TopCoder Inc.](http://www.topcoder.com/)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Works with solutions written in C++, C#, Java, Python, VB.\n- VERY simple interface.\n  To run your solution on seed 5 just type: ```5```.\n  To run your solution on first 100 seeds, just type: ```1 100```.\n- Keeps track of the best scores for each seed, so you can compare your solutions locally.\n- Exports input data from visualizer into file, so you can debug on them.\n- and many more...\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMarathoner is written in Python, so first get some Python at [http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org) (versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x are supported).\n\nIf you have *pip* Python package manager installed, run: ```pip install marathoner```. To upgrade for a newer version, run: ```pip install marathoner --upgrade```.\n\nOr download the source code from GitHub and from *tc-marathoner* directory run: ```python setup.py install```.\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nLet me show you how to setup Marathoner for a recent Marathon Match called [RectanglesAndHoles](http://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&compid=40847&rd=15982).\n\n1. Download the visualizer [RectanglesAndHolesVis.jar](http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/RectanglesAndHoles/RectanglesAndHolesVis.jar).\n   Create a solution that communicates with visualizer as described [here](http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=670892&start=0)\n   and make sure your solution works by running:\n\n   ```java -jar RectanglesAndHolesVis.jar -exec \"<command>\" -seed 1```\n\n2. From command line run: ```marathoner new RectanglesAndHolesMarat```\n\n   In your current directory Marathoner will create a new directory named *RectanglesAndHolesMarat* where it will\n   store all its work files related to RectanglesAndHoles match.\n\n3. Go into newly created directory *RectanglesAndHolesMarat* and edit *marathoner.cfg* file.\n   Fill out its contents as described in comments inside the file. Here is an example of my *marathoner.cfg* file for this match:\n\n   ```\n   [marathoner]\n   visualizer = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\RectanglesAndHoles\\RectanglesAndHolesVis.jar\n   solution = \"c:\\Users\\Mimino\\RectanglesAndHoles\\RectanglesAndHoles.exe\"\n   source = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\RectanglesAndHoles\\RectanglesAndHoles.cpp\n   testcase = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\RectanglesAndHoles\\testcase.txt\n   maximize = true\n   novis = -novis\n   vis =\n   params = -sz 1000\n   ```\n\n4. While still in *RectanglesAndHolesMarat* directory, from command line run: ```marathoner run```.\n   If everything is okay, you should see a welcome message and the command line prompt. Try to run:\n   ```\n   >>> 1\n   Running single test 1...\n   Holes count (Cnt) = 12345\n   Holes area (Area) = 6789\n   Score = 123456.0\n           Run time: 0.14\n           New score: 1234567.00\n           Best score: 123456.00\n           Relative score: 0.09999\n   ```\n   You should also see the visualization for the seed number 1. Close the visualizer and type another command.\n\nCongratulations, you are now ready to compete!\n\n\nBasic commands\n--------------\n\n#### &lt;seed&gt; [vis params]\nRun single test with visualization. Examples:\n```\n>>> 5                   # run seed 5\n>>> 5 -sz 500           # run seed 5 with additional visualizer option \"-sz 500\"\n```\n\n#### &lt;seed1&gt; &lt;seed2&gt; [vis params]\nRun multiple tests with seeds from interval *seed1*-*seed2*, inclusive. Visualization is turned off. Examples:\n```\n>>> 1 100               # run seeds from interval 1-100, inclusive\n>>> 1 100 -sz 500       # run seeds from interval 1-100, inclusive, with additional visualizer option \"-sz 500\"\n```\n\n#### best [seed1] [seed2]\nPrint the best scores for the seeds. Examples:\n```\n>>> best                # print the best scores for all the known seeds\n>>> best 5              # print the best score for seed 5\n>>> best 1 100          # print the best scores for seeds from interval 1-100, inclusive\n```\n\n#### clear\nClear console window.\n\n#### help\nShow list of available commands.\n\n#### quit\nQuit Marathoner prompt.\n\n\nTagging of solutions\n--------------------\n\nOnce you have implemented a solution that you plan to run on a large number\nof tests you can *tag* the solution, before you do so:\n```\n>>> tag create my_solution             # create a tag from the current solution and name it \"my_solution\"\n```\nMarathoner will compute the hash of your current source code (you specified path to your source code in .cfg file)\nand store it under the name \"*my_solution*\". Now whenever you run some tests,\nMarathoner will check the hash of your current source code against the hashes\nof the source codes that you have already tagged. If there is a match between the hashes,\nMarathoner will store the results of the tests under the matched tag name.\n```\n>>> tag                                 # display the list of existing tags\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n|             Tag |             Created |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| (*) my_solution | 2013-12-13 04:26:54 |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n(*) means current active tag\n>>> 1 100                               # run seeds 1-100 and store the scores under \"my_solution\" tag\nRunning 100 tests with tag \"my_solution\"...\n>>> 101 200                             # run seeds 101-200 and add them to \"my_solution\" tag\nRunning 100 tests with tag \"my_solution\"...\n>>> tag my_solution                     # view the scores of seeds 1-200 of \"my_solution\" tag\n```\nAnd now comes the killer! When you have tagged many different solutions\nand you want to compare them against each other, simply run the command:\n```\n>>> tag my_solution other_solution      # compare the scores of tags \"my_solution\" and \"other_solution\"\n```\n\nNote: Be careful when you change the source code of your solution and don't compile it.\nMarathoner will still run the old code, but the hash of the source file will be different.\n\n\n#### tag\nPrint the list of existing tags. Examples:\n```\n>>> tag\n|---------------|---------------------|\n|           Tag |             Created |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n| (*) solution1 | 2013-12-13 04:26:54 |\n|     solution2 | 2013-12-13 01:14:32 |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n(*) means current active tag\n```\n\n#### tag &lt;tag_name&gt;\nPrint the scores of the selected tag. Exmaples:\n```\n>>> tag my_solution\n|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Seed |    Score |     Best | Relative | Run time |\n|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|    1 |   257.00 |   257.00 |    1.000 |     1.31 |\n|    2 |   353.00 |   352.00 |    0.997 |     1.00 |\n|    3 |     0.00 |   294.00 |    0.000 |     1.04 |\n|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\nRelative score of \"my_solution\" tag on 3 tests: 1.997\nAverage relative score: 0.66567\nYou have scored zero points on 1 seeds. Here are some of the seeds: [3]\n```\n\n#### tag &lt;tag_name1&gt; &lt;tag_name2&gt; ...\nCompare the scores of the selected tags. Only the seeds that all the tags have in common will be compared. Examples:\n```\n>>> tag create solution1              # create tag \"solution1\"\n>>> 1 10                              # run the seeds 1-10 and store them under \"solution1\" tag\n\n( change source code of solution )\n>>> tag create solution2              # create tag \"solution2\"\n>>> 5 15                              # run the seeds 5-15 and store them under \"solution2\" tag\n>>> tag solution1 solution2           # compare the score of solutions on seeds 5-10 (these are the seeds they have in common)\n\n( chagnge source code again )\n>>> tag create solution3              # create tag \"solution3\"\n>>> 9 10                              # run the seeds 9-10 and store them under \"solution3\" tag\n>>> tag solution1 solution2 solution3 # compare the score of solutions on seeds 9-10\n```\n\n#### tag create &lt;tag_name&gt;\nCreate a tag from the current solution and name it *tag_name*. Examples:\n```\n>>> tag create solution1                # tag the current solution with name \"solution1\"\n>>> 1 10                                # run the seeds 1-10 and store them under \"solution1\" tag\nRunning 10 tests with tag \"solution1\"...\n\n( change source code of solution )\n>>> 1 10                                # now, because the source code has changed, the current solution doesn't have any tag\nRunning 10 tests...\n\n( change source code back )             # Marathoner automatically detects the change and \"solution1\" tag is active again\n>>> 11 20                               # run the seeds 11-20 and store them under \"solution1\" tag\nRunning 10 tests with tag \"solution1\"...\n```\n\n#### tag delete &lt;tag&gt;\nDelete the selected tag. Examples:\n```\n>>> tag delete solution1\nAre you sure you want to delete tag \"solution1\"? [y/n]  y\nTag \"solution1\" was deleted.\n```\n\n\nTips and tricks\n---------------\n\n- If your solution gets stuck, press ```q``` to easily terminate it. If you are running multiple tests, it terminates the whole execution (best scores of already run tests are still saved, though).\n- If your solution crashes on some seed and you want to debug it, you can find input data of this seed in file specified by *testcase* field in *marathoner.cfg*.\n- You can find log of the last multiple-tests run in *RectanglesAndHolesMarat* directory, called *multiple_tests.log*.\n- When you run multiple tests, standard error output from your solution is not displayed. But lines starting with ```!``` are displayed, still.\n- Marathoner stores copies of all tagged source codes in ```RectanglesAndHolesMarat/tags``` directory, so you can later return to them.\n- If you internally measure running time of your solution, output to standard error a line in format: ```Run time = <run_time>```. Marathoner will use this time instead of the one it measures externally, which can be rather imprecise.",
