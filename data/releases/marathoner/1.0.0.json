    "description": "Marathoner\n==========\n\nMarathoner is a command line tool for effective local testing of solutions for [Marathon Match competitions](http://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewActiveContests) organized by [TopCoder Inc.](http://www.topcoder.com/)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. Written in Python.\n- VERY simple interface.\n  To run your solution on seed 5 just type: ```5```.\n  To run your solution on first 100 seeds, just type: ```1 100```.\n- Keeping track of the best scores for each seed, so you can compare your solutions locally.\n- Export of input data from visualizer into file, so you can debug on them.\n- Works with visualizer .jar files, so it doesn't require any changes to the solution code.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nGet Python 2.6 or 2.7 at [http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org).\n\nIf you have *pip* Python package manager installed, run: ```pip install marathoner```.\n\nOr download the source code and from *marathoner* directory run: ```python setup.py install```.\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nLet me show you how to setup Marathoner for a recent Marathon Match called [ColorLinker](http://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&compid=34370&rd=15825).\n\n1. Download the visualizer [ColorLinkerVis.jar](http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/ColorLinker/v2/ColorLinkerVis.jar).\n   Create a solution that communicates with visualizer as described [here](http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=670892&start=0)\n   and make sure your solution works by running: ```java -jar ColorLinkerVis.jar -exec \"<command>\" -seed 1```\n\n2. From command line run: ```marathoner new ColorLinkerMarat```.\n\n   In your current directory Marathoner will create a new directory named *ColorLinkerMarat* where it will\n   store all files and folders related to ColorLinker match.\n\n3. Go into newly created directory *ColorLinkerMarat* and edit *marathoner.cfg* file.\n   Fill out its contents as described in comments inside the file. Here is an example of my .cfg file for this match:\n\n   ```\n   [marathoner]\n   visualizer = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\ColorLinker\\ColorLinkerVis.jar\n   solution = \"c:\\Users\\Mimino\\ColorLinker\\ColorLinker.exe\"  # notice the quotes here!\n   # for Java:\n   #   solution = java -cp \"c:\\Users\\Mimino\\ColorLinker\\ColorLinker.class\"\n   source = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\ColorLinker\\ColorLinker\\ColorLinker.cpp\n   testcase = c:\\Users\\Mimino\\ColorLinker\\testcase.txt\n   maximize = false\n   novis = -novis\n   vis =\n   params = -side 10\n   ```\n\n4. While still in *ColorLinkerMarat* directory, from command line run: ```marathoner run```.\n   If everything is okay, you should see a welcome message and the command line prompt. Try typing:\n   ```\n   >>> 1\n   Running single test 1...\n   Score = 123456.0\n           Run time: 0.146289\n           New score: 123456.000000\n           Old score: 1234567.000000\n           +90,00% better\n   ```\n   You should see the visualization for the seed number 1. Close the visualizer and type another command.\n\n   Congratulations, you are now ready to compete!\n\n\nAvailable commands\n------------------\n\n#### &lt;seed&gt; [vis params]\nRun single test with visualization. Examples:\n```\n>>> 5                   # run seed 5\n>>> 5 -side 15          # run seed 5 with additional visualizer option \"-side 15\"\n```\n\n#### &lt;seed1&gt; &lt;seed2&gt; [vis params]\nRun multiple tests with seeds from interval *seed1*-*seed2*, inclusive. Visualization is turned off. Examples:\n```\n>>> 1 100               # run seeds from interval 1-100, inclusive\n>>> 1 100 -side 15      # run seeds from interval 1-100, inclusive, with additional visualizer option \"-side 15\"\n```\n\n#### best [seed1] [seed2]\nPrint the best scores for the seeds. Examples:\n```\n>>> best                # print the best scores for all the known seeds\n>>> best 5              # print the best score for seed 5\n>>> best 1 100          # print the best scores for seeds in interval 1-100, inclusive\n```\n\n#### clear\nClear console window.\n\n#### help\nShow list of available commands.\n\n#### quit\nQuit Marathoner prompt.\n\n\nTips and tricks\n---------------\n\n- If your solution gets stuck, type \"*Q*\" to terminate its execution. If you are executing multiple tests, it terminates the whole execution.\n- If your solution crashes on some seed and you want to debug it, you can find input data of this seed in file specified by *testcase* field in the .cfg file.\n- If you internally measure running time of your solution, from your solution output to standard error line in format: \"```Run time = <run_time>```\" and Marathoner will parse it out for further processing.\n- You can find log of the last multiple-tests run in *ColorLinkerMarat* dictionary, called *multiple_tests.log*.\n- When you run multiple tests, standard error output from your solution is not displayed. But lines starting with \"!\" are displayed, still.\n",
