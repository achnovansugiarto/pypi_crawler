Its use is similar, with just a bunch more options.\n\nSpecific options\n-----------------\n\nPlease look for options at : http://pypi.python.org/pypi/minitage.recipe.common#options-shared-by-all-the-recipes\n\n* urls\n\n    See the shared options for more information on how to set them.\n    This is how to specify a distrbituion with is not indexed on pypi and where find-links dance can not work.\n    This is also how to specify to install something from svn::\n\n        urls = http://foo.tld/my_super_egg|svn|666 # checkout and install this egg from svn at revision 666\n* eggs\n\n    A list of egg requirements to install without the version specs bit.::\n\n        Plone\n        lxml\n\n* EGGNAME-patch-options\n    patch binary to use for this egg\n* EGGNAME-patch-binary\n    Options to give to the patch program when applying patches for this egg\n* EGGNAME-patches\n    Specific patchs for an egg name to apply at install time::\n\n        Django-patches = ${buildout:directory}/foo.patch\n\n* EGGNAME-UNAME-patches\n    Same as previous, but will just occurs on this UNAME specifc OS (linux|freebsd|darwin)\n    Specific patchs for an egg name to apply at install time::\n\n        Django-linux-patches = ${buildout:directory}/foo.patch\n\n* EGGNAME-VERSION-patches\n    patches apply only on this specific version\n\n* EGGNAME-VERSION-UNAME-patches\n    patches apply only on this specific version\n\n\n* versions\n    Default to buildout:versions. versions part to use to pin the version of the installed eggs.\n    It defaults to buildout's one\n* index\n    Custom eggs index (not pypi/simple). It defaults to buildout's one\n* find-links\n    additionnal links vhere we can find eggs. It defaults to buildout's one\n* extra-paths\n        Extra paths to include in a generated script or at build time.\n* relative-paths\n    If set to true, then egg paths will be generated relative to the script path.\n    This allows a buildout to be moved without breaking egg paths.\n    This option can be set in either the script section or in the buildout section.\n* Specifying the python to use, two ways:\n\n    * python\n        The name of a section to get the Python executable from. If not specified, then\n        the buildout python option is used. The Python executable is found in the\n        executable option of the named section. It defaults to buildout's one\n    * executable\n        path to the python executable to use.\n\n* hooks\n\n  A hook is in the form /path/to/hook:CALLABLE::\n\n        myhook=${buildout:directory}/toto.py:foo\n\n  Where we have toto.py::\n\n        def foo(options, buildout):\n            return 'Hourray'\n\n  The complete possible hooks list:\n\n    * post-download-hook\n        hook executed after each download\n    * post-checkout-hook\n        hook executed after each checkout\n    * EGGNAME-pre-setup-hook\n        hook executed before running the setup.py dance\n    * EGGNAME-post-setup-hook\n        hook executed after running the setup.py dance\n\nPatches\n--------\n\n    * When you use patches for an egg, his version will become ::\n\n        Django-1.0-final -> Django-1.0-final-ZMinitagePatched-$PatchesNamesComputation$\n\n    * This name have some Z* inside to make some precedence on other eggs at the same version. (see setuptools naming scheme)\n    * After that the egg is created, the buildout is backed up and patched to point to this version\n    * Thus, you can have in your common egg cache, this egg for your specific project, and the classical one for others.\n      This can be interessant, for example, for the zope RelStorage patch to apply on ZODB code.\n\nDetailled documentation\n-------------------------\n\nLet's create a buildout configuration file::\n\n    >>> rmdir(tempdir)\n    >>> mkdir(tempdir)\n    >>> cd(tempdir)\n    >>> a = [mkdir(d) for d in ('eggs', 'develop-eggs', 'bin', 'src')]\n    >>> install_develop_eggs(['minitage.recipe'])\n    >>> install_eggs_from_pathes(['zc.buildout'], sys.path)\n    >>> touch('buildout.cfg')\n    >>> sh('buildout -o bootstrap')\n    buildout -o bootstrap...\n    >>> index_url = start_server(os.path.sep.join(tempdir))\n\nInitializing test env.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n::\n\n    >>> if not os.path.exists('foo'):\n    ...     mkdir('foo')\n    ... else:\n    ...     rmdir(foo)\n    ...     mkdir('foo')\n    >>> touch('foo/setup.py', data=\"\"\"\n    ... from setuptools import setup\n    ... setup(name='foo', version='1.0')\n    ...\n    ... \"\"\")\n    >>> touch('foo/toto.py', data=\"\"\"\n    ... def f():\n    ...     print \"foo\"\n    ...\n    ... \"\"\")\n    >>> noecho = [os.remove(d) for d in os.listdir('.') if '.tar.gz' in d]\n    >>> os.chdir('foo')\n    >>> sh('python setup.py sdist')\n    p...\n    >>> touch('setup.py', data=\"\"\"\n    ... from setuptools import setup\n    ... setup(name='foo', version='2.0')\n    ...\n    ... \"\"\")\n    >>> sh('python setup.py sdist')\n    p...\n    >>> noecho = [shutil.copy(os.path.join('dist', d), os.path.join('..', d)) for d in os.listdir('dist')]\n    >>> os.chdir('..')\n    >>> touch('patch', data=\"\"\"\n    ... --- foo.old/setup.py    2009-04-18 13:36:40.199680168 +0200\n    ... +++ foo/setup.py        2009-04-18 13:26:12.307692349 +0200\n    ... @@ -2,3 +2,7 @@\n    ...  from setuptools import setup\n    ...  setup(name='foo', version='2.0')\n    ...\n    ... +\n    ... +\n    ... +print 'patched'\n    ... +\n    ... \"\"\")\n\nInstalling eggs from index or find links, the classical way to install python packages\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nWe need to specify a find-links entry to make the recipe find our 'foo' egg as it is not on pypi\nAs we want to show the update capability of the recipe, we will first install the oldest foo version.\n\n    >>> noecho = [remove(os.path.join('eggs', egg)) for egg in os.listdir('eggs') if 'foo' in egg]\n    >>> data = \"\"\"\n    ...
