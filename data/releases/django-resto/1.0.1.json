    "description": "django-resto (REplicated STOrage) provides file storage backends that can store\nfiles coming into a Django site on several servers simultaneously, using HTTP.\n``HybridStorage`` will store the files locally on the filesystem and remotely,\nwhile ``DistributedStorage`` will only store them remotely.\n\nThis works for files uploaded by users through the admin or through custom\nDjango forms, and also for files created by the application code, provided it\nuses the standard `storage API`_.\n\ndjango-resto is useful for sites deployed in a multi-server environment, in\norder to accept uploaded files and have them available on all media servers\nimmediately for subsequent web requests that could be routed to any machine.\n\n`django-resto`_ is a fork of `django_dust`_ with a strong focus on consistency,\nwhile django_dust is more concerned with availability. The two projects cover\ndifferent use-cases.\n\ndjango-resto is released under the BSD license, like Django itself.\n\n.. _storage API: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/files/storage/\n.. _django-resto: https://github.com/aaugustin/django-resto\n.. _django_dust: https://github.com/isagalaev/django_dust",
