    "description": "# margo-loader\n\n> Import Jupyter Notebooks notebooks as Python modules\n\n## Video tutorial\n\n[Live Coding Demo: Using Jupyter Notebooks as Python Modules with Margo Loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EgsAb56jY0).\n\n## Demo Notebooks  \n\nWant to see Margo Loader in action before installing it? Here's a live [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X1vuPRrj7SOpGl71wFCwFNgX40W18Kyl#scrollTo=WyrdS8A06eA6) on Google Colaboratory.\n\nA more realistic suite of notebooks for background deletion and color extraction on William Blake prints is available in this [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/zenodo/10.5281/zenodo.4554402/) VM, which runs in a browser without installation.\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/zenodo/10.5281/zenodo.4554402/)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install margo-loader, run:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/margo-notebooks/margo-loader-py\n```\n\n## Importing a notebook\n\nAssuming you have a file called \"notebook.ipynb\":\n\n```python\nimport margo_loader\nimport notebook\n```\n\n## ignore-cell\n\nNot every cell in a Notebook makes sense to include in its module representation.\n\nIf you want to prevent a cell from being exported, start the cell with the specially-formatted comment line `# :: ignore-cell ::`, like this:\n\n```python\n# :: ignore-cell ::\nprint(\"This code will not be executed when imported with margo-loader\")\n```\n\nThis special code comment is called a Margo note. Margo notes in Python cells begin with `# ::` to differentiate them from regular comments, and end with `::`.\n\nLearn more about the underlying Margo syntax [here](https://github.com/jakekara/nbdl/).\n\nAn alias for `ignore-cell` is `skip`. So this does the same thing:\n\n```python\n# :: skip ::\nprint(\"This code will not be executed when imported with margo-loader\")\n``` \n## Creating virtual submodules\n\nYou can organize code cells into virtual submodules within\na notebook. This in effect allows you to group cells from the same notebook.\nHere's an example of a few cells from the file\n`test_notebooks/greetings.ipynb` in this repo.\n\n```python\n# greetings.ipynb\n# :: submodule: \"grumpy\" ::\ndef say_hello(to=\"world\"):\n    return f\"Oh, uhh, hi {to}...\"\n```\n\n```python\n# greetings.ipynb\n# :: submodule: \"nice\" ::\ndef say_hello(to=\"world\"):\n  return f\"Hello, {to}! Nice to see you.\"\n```\n\nNotice we define the same `say_hello` function twice. If the entire notebook\nwere imported, the second `say_hello` would overwrite the first. However, we can\nimport either of these submodules or both using Python's standard import syntax once we\nimport `margo_loader`.\n\n```python\n>>> import margo_loader\n>>> from test_notebooks.greetings import nice, grumpy\n>>> nice.say_hello()\n'Hello, world! Nice to see you.'\n>>> grumpy.say_hello()\n'Oh, uhh, hi world...'\n>>>\n```\n\n## Prevent a notebook from being imported\n\nTo prevent a notebook from being imported, use:\n\n```python\n# :: not-a-module ::\n```\n\nor \n\n```python\n# :: do-not-import ::\n```\n\nThese are currently aliases with the same behavior. If you try to import a notebook that contains a `do-not-import`/`not-a-module` declaration, it will raise an exception.\n\n## Skipping multiple cells\n\nIf you want to ignore a lot of cells during import, you can use\n\n\n```python\n# :: module-stop ::\n```\n\nand\n\n```python\n# :: module-start :: \n```\n\nto exclude blocks of cells.\n\nAny cell including and after a cell that contains `module-stop` will be excluded during import until a `module-start` cell is encountered.\n\nConversely, any cell including and after a cell that contains `module-start` will be excluded during import until a `module-stop` is encountered.\n\nNote that you can also use `start` and `stop` instead of `module-start` and `module-stop`. These are aliases.\n\nYou can use `module-stop` with no subsequent `module-start`. This will have the effect of ignoring all subsequent cells.\n\n## Working with percent-formatted notebooks\n\nThis library works with Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) as well as python files\nwith percent cell formatting using the file extension `.pynb`. These are plain\nsource Python files that use `# %%` to split the document into cells. [Read more\nhere](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py).\n\nLook at `test_notebooks/hello_notebook_pynb.pynb` in this repo for an example of\na code-cell notebook.\n\n**STABILITY NOTE:** *This is an alpha feature. The .pynb extension may be changed in a future version*\n\n## Prior art\n\nThis project borrows its implementation approach from [a Jupyter Notebook\ndocumentation\nexample](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Importing%20Notebooks.html)\nthat imports notebooks in their entirety as if they were `.py` files. The key difference Margo Loader adds is use of Margo notes to create preoprocessor directives  `ignore-cell` and `submodule`.\n\n",
