    "description": "﻿Note: This is an upgrade of the misc-utility repository with Python 2 support being phased out.\n\nMiscellaneous Python scripts developed over the course of several independent consulting projects. This also includes some code samples I adapted from publicly available source. (The code is not proprietary in nature. For example, it was not \"borrowed\" from proprietary source files, nor based on proprietary processes.)\n\nSpoiler alter: this is not \"Pythonic python\": I'm more into R&D than production programming. Nonetheless, there's a some useful scripts here, so I made the repository available. It is public in the spirit of open source software. \n \nThis repository is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public Version 3 (LGPLv3). See LICENSE.txt.\n\nTom O'Hara\nMay 2021\n",
