It also includes functions for frame stiffness and area function calibration as well as a number of plotting functions. Additionally the library allows to read SEM images and optimize them\n\nThe library can read:\n- xls files from the vendors MTS, Agilent, Keysight, which produced the XP and G200 indenters\n- hap files from the Fischer-Scope\n- zip-files which include all the files of the Micromaterials NanoXtreme\n- some common format which is based on the NeXus common data format\n- Tif images from Zeiss and FEI/ThermoFischer\n\n\nInstall by\n``` bash\npip install micromechanics\n```\n\nRun test using the default data\n``` python\nfrom micromechanics.indentation import Indentation\ni = Indentation()\ni.plotAll()\n```\n\nAlternatively, for Tif images\n``` python\nfrom micromechanics.tif import Tif\n```\n\nMore information as well as tutorials can be found at: [Read the docs](https://micromechanics.github.io/micromechanics/)\n\nIf you want to contribute to the development, we develop at [github](https://github.com/micromechanics/micromechanics)\n\n\n# Contributors\n- Steffen Brinckmann\n- Velislava Yonkova\n- Ruomeng (Nicole) Chen\n\n\n# Information for developers\nTest the code: linting, documentation and then the tests from project main directory\n``` bash\npylint micromechanics\nmake -C docs html\npython tests/testVerification.py\npython tests/testAllFiles.py\npython tests/testAgilent_xls.py\npython tests/testMicromaterials_hdf5.py\npython tests/testFischerScope_hdf5.py\n```\nThese tests are also executed as github action once pushed.\n\nor the short form to run all the tests\n``` bash\npython -m unittest tests/test*\n```\n\n#TODO turn all tests into one github action\n\nThen upload/create-pull-request to github, via\n``` bash\n./commit.py 'my message'\n```\n\n## How to find bugs that occurred in a past commit\nSteps:\n- Git history in nice ASCII  => save in file in distant folder; along with notes\n- go to point in history (do not change the present)\n- find diff: always old^ new\n- run your tests\n- undo your changes since checkout\n- go back to present\n\n``` bash\ngit log --oneline --graph\ngit checkout bf0b634\ngit diff e7eac50^ fed7119  #(old^ new)\n# test\ngit reset --hard\ngit checkout main\n```\n\n\n",
