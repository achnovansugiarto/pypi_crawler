    "description": "mantel\n======\n\nPython implementation of the Mantel test (Mantel, 1967), which is a significance test of the correlation between two distance matrices.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `mantel` package is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install mantel\n```\n\nOnce installed, the package can be imported in the normal way:\n\n```python\nimport mantel\n```\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe `mantel` package contains one main function, `test()`, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `X` *array_like*: First distance matrix (condensed or redundant).\n- `Y` *array_like*: Second distance matrix (condensed or redundant), where the order of elements corresponds to the order of elements in *X*.\n- `perms` *int*, optional: The number of permutations to perform (default: `10000`). A larger number gives more consistent results but takes longer to run. If the number of possible permutations is smaller, all permutations will be tested (this can be forced by setting `perms` to `0`).\n- `method` *str*, optional: Type of correlation coefficient to use; either `pearson` or `spearman` (default: `pearson`).\n- `tail` *str*, optional: Which tail to test in the calculation of the empirical p-value; either `upper`, `lower`, or `two-tail` (default: `two-tail`).\n- `ignore_nans` *bool*, optional: Ignore `np.nan` values in the *Y* matrix (default: `False`). This can be useful if you have missing values in one of the matrices.\n\nThe function returns a `MantelResult` object, which has various properties that can be queried:\n\n- `MantelResult.r` *float*: Veridical correlation\n- `MantelResult.p` *float*: Empirical p-value\n- `MantelResult.z` *float*: Standard score (z-score)\n- `MantelResult.correlations` *array*: Sample correlations\n- `MantelResult.mean` *float*: Mean of sample correlations\n- `MantelResult.std` *float*: Standard deviation of sample correlations\n\n\nWorked Example\n--------------\n\nLet’s say we have a set of four objects and we want to correlate *X* (the distances between the four objects using one measure) with *Y* (the corresponding distances between the four objects using another measure). For example, your “objects” might be species of animal, and your two measures might be genetic distance and geographical distance (the hypothesis being that species that live far away from each other will tend to be more genetically different).\n\nFor four objects, there are six pairwise distances. First you should compute the pairwise distances for each measure and store the distances in two condensed or redundant distance matrices (the `test()` function will accept either format). No distance functions are included in this package, since the metrics you use will be specific to your particular data.\n\nLet’s say our data looks like this:\n\n```python\n#         E.g. species A through D\n#         A~B  A~C  A~D  B~C  B~D  C~D\ndists1 = [0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.4] # E.g. genetic distances\ndists2 = [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.7, 0.8, 0.3] # E.g. geographical distances\n```\n\nWe pass the data to the `test()` function and optionally specify the number of permutations to test against, a correlation method to use (either ‘pearson’ or ‘spearman’), and which tail to test (either ‘upper’, ‘lower’, or ‘two-tail’). In this case, we’ll use the Pearson correlation and test the upper tail, since we’re expecting to find a positive correlation.\n\n```python\nresult = mantel.test(dists1, dists2, perms=10000, method='pearson', tail='upper')\n```\n\nThis will measure the veridical Pearson correlation between the two sets of pairwise distances. It then repeatedly measures the correlation again and again under permutations of one of the distance matrices to produce a distribution of correlations under the null hypothesis. In the example above, we requested 10,000 permutations (the default). However, for four objects there are only 4! = 24 possible permutations of the matrix. If the number of requested permutations is greater than the number of possible permutations (as is the case here), then the `test()` function simply tests against all possible permutations of the matrix, yielding a deterministic result.\n\nPrinting the result shows the veridical correlation, empirical p-value, and z-score:\n\n```python\nprint(result)\n# MantelResult(0.9148936170212766, 0.041666666666666664, 2.040402492261023)\n```\n\nIndividual results can be accessed through the relevant object property. For example, to check if the veridical correlation is significant, we could do:\n\n```python\nprint(result.p < 0.05)\n# True\n```\n\nSince the p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is a significant correlation between the two sets of distances. This suggests that the species that live closer together tend to be more genetically related, while those that live further apart tend to be less genetically related.\n\n\nPlotting\n--------\n\nThe `mantel` package also provides a `plot()` function, which plots the distribution of sample correlations against the veridical. For example, here we generate two random distance matrices and plot the results:\n\n```python\ndists1 = np.random.random(351)\ndists2 = np.random.random(351)\n\nresult = mantel.test(dists1, dists2)\n\nfig, axis = mantel.plot(result)\nfig.savefig('example.svg')\n```\n\n<img src='example.svg' width='100%'>\n\n\nThe `plot()` function has several other arguments for customization:\n\n- `alpha` *float*: Significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis (default: 5%)\n- `hist_color`*str*: Color used for the histogram bars (default: 'lightgray').\n- `gaussian_color` *str*:  Color used for the normal distribution curve and the confidence interval limits (default: 'black').\n- `acceptance_color` *str*: Color used for drawing the vertical line and the label of the veridical correlation if the null hypothesis is rejected according to the significance level value (default: 'black').\n- `rejection_color` *str*: Color used for drawing the vertical line and the label of the veridical correlation if the null hypothesis cannot be rejected according to the significance level value (default: 'black').\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis package is licensed under the terms of the MIT License.\n\n\nReferences and Links\n--------------------\n\nMantel, N.
