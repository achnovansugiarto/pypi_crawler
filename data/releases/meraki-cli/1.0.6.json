It takes all published functions in the library and makes them available to the user as a standard command-line tool with `-h` help options, commands, switches, and arguments. It also supports classic Linux-style pipelining, allowing the output of one instance of the program to be piped to the input of another.\n\n### Examples\n\n- List your associated organizations: `meraki organizations getOrganizations`\n- List the Meraki networks within an organization: `meraki organizations getOrganizationNetworks --organizationId 123456`\n- List the MX VLANs on a network: `meraki appliance getNetworkApplianceVlans --networkId N_12345`\n- Add a new MX VLAN to a network: `meraki appliance createNetworkApplianceVlan --networkId 'N_12345' --id '100' --name 'My New VLAN' --kwargs '{\"applianceIp\": \"10.0.0.1\", \"subnet\": \"10.0.0.0/24\"}'`\n\n### Capabilities\n\nSince the Meraki-CLI tool builds its arguments directly off of Meraki's SDK, it's capabilities exactly match those of the SDK and are updated automatically when Meraki adds new API capabilities. For a list of available commands from the last build of the Meraki-CLI, check out the **[Meraki-CLI Command Guide](COMMAND_GUIDE.md)**.\n\n### Screenshot\n[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](screenshot.png)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.

[Contributing](#contributing)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n## GETTING STARTED\n\n## Prepare your OS\n\nIn order to use Meraki-CLI, you need to have Python 3 installed on your OS. If you do not yet have Python 3 installed, visit this [Python 3 Installation Instructions Page](https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python) and install for your operating system.\n\n\n## Install Meraki-CLI\n\nThe easiest (and recommended) way to install Meraki-CLI is to use PIP.\n\nYou can use PIP to install Meraki-CLI with the command `pip3 install meraki-cli` or `python3 -m pip install meraki-cli`\n\nTo see if Meraki-CLI was successfully installed, run the `meraki` command and see if it displays the help menu.\n\n#### Upgrading\n\nIf you already have Meraki-CLi installed and want to upgrade to the latest release, use the command `pip3 install --upgrade --no-cache-dir meraki-cli` or `python3 -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir meraki-cli`.\n\n\n## Getting and Using your API Key\n\nMeraki-CLI is command-line driven and once installed can be run with the command `meraki`. Once you have installed it, you can see the command guide by running the `meraki` command by itself.\n\nIn order to operate the CLI you need to input your Meraki API key using one of two methods:\n\n1. Saving your API key as an environment variable (recommended):\n    - **Windows**: `set MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY=093b24e85df15a3e66f1fc359f4c48493eaa1b73`\n    - **MacOS/Linux**: `export MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY=093b24e85df15a3e66f1fc359f4c48493eaa1b73`\n    - Once saved as an environment variable, you don't need to use the `-k` option when running commands\n2. Use the `-k <api_key>` or `--apiKey <api_key>` argument at the top level of the command like `meraki -k <api_key>`\n\nYou can obtain a Meraki API key by logging into the Meraki dashboard and clicking your user name in the top right corner and browsing to **My profile** then view the 'API Access' section near the bottom of the page. Then click on the '**Generate new API key**' button and copy down your new API key before saving. It will be a long hexadecimal string.\n\n> Note: The API key seen above is a public one Meraki provides for testing against their sandbox networks. All the output examples shown below use that key.\n\n\n## A Few Starting Commands\n\nOnce you have your new key, try printing out your organizations with the command `meraki -k API_KEY_HERE organizations getOrganizations`, substituting in your API key. This will print out a formatted table of your organizations. If you saved your API key as an environment variable, you can exclude the `-k` argument and simply issue `meraki organizations getOrganizations`.\n\nTake one of your organization ID numbers and look at the networks in it with `meraki organizations getOrganizationNetworks --organizationId 123456`\n\nYou can reformat any of this data into JSON output by adding the `-j` switch (before the command) to look something like `meraki -j organizations getOrganizations`\n- It is important to note that the columns included in a table often do not include all of the data returned from the API. If you need to see all the data returned, then use the `-j` switch and allow the tool to print out JSON data.\n\nYou can also change the table data which is output by filtering and ordering table columns. To do this, use the `-c` argument and provide a comma-seperated list of columns to display. Example: `meraki -c id,name,description`\n\nTo see any help menu, use the `-h` option at any command level:\n- `meraki -h` or just `meraki` will show you the top level options and arguments\n- `meraki appliance -h` or just `meraki appliance` will show you all the appliance-related commands\n- `meraki appliance createNetworkApplianceVlan -h` will show you an instruction page with all the arguments and options available for creating a new network appliance VLAN\n\n\nIf you have any Meraki MS switches available, try viewing the port configurations with `meraki switch getDeviceSwitchPorts --serial 1234-ABCD-5678` or you can view the operational port stats by using `meraki switch getDeviceSwitchPortsStatuses --serial 1234-ABCD-5678`\n\n\n## A Note About --kwargs\n\nSome Meraki-CLI commands require arguments to be provided which are not explicitly defined in the underlying functions, but are documented in the command help page. To see an example of this, run the command `meraki switch updateDeviceSwitchPort -h`. The example is shown below\n\n```\n~$\n~$ meraki switch updateDeviceSwitchPort -h\nusage: meraki-cli.py switch updateDeviceSwitchPort [-h] --serial STRING --portId STRING [--kwargs JSON_STRING]\n\n        **Update a switch port**\n        https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!update-device-switch-port\n\n        - serial (string): (required)\n        - portId (string): (required)\n        - name (string): The name of the switch port\n        - tags (array): The list of tags of the switch port\n        - enabled (boolean): The status of the switch port\n        - type (string): The type of the switch port ('trunk' or 'access')\n        - vlan (integer): The VLAN of the switch port. A null value will clear the value set for trunk ports.\n        - voiceVlan (integer): The voice VLAN of the switch port. Only applicable to access ports.\n        - allowedVlans (string): The VLANs allowed on the switch port. Only applicable to trunk ports.\n        - poeEnabled (boolean): The PoE status of the switch port\n        - isolationEnabled (boolean): The isolation status of the switch port\n        - rstpEnabled (boolean): The rapid spanning tree protocol status\n        - stpGuard (string): The state of the STP guard ('disabled', 'root guard', 'bpdu guard' or 'loop guard')\n        - linkNegotiation (string): The link speed for the switch port\n        - portScheduleId (string): The ID of the port schedule. A value of null will clear the port schedule.\n        - udld (string): The action to take when Unidirectional Link is detected (Alert only, Enforce). Default configuration is Alert only.\n        - accessPolicyType (string): The type of the access policy of the switch port. Only applicable to access ports. Can be one of 'Open', 'Custom access policy', 'MAC allow list' or 'Sticky MAC allow list'\n        - accessPolicyNumber (integer): The number of a custom access policy to configure on the switch port. Only applicable when 'accessPolicyType' is 'Custom access policy'\n        - macAllowList (array): Only devices with MAC addresses specified in this list will have access to this port. Up to 20 MAC addresses can be defined. Only applicable when 'accessPolicyType' is 'MAC allow list'\n        - stickyMacAllowList (array): The initial list of MAC addresses for sticky Mac allow list. Only applicable when 'accessPolicyType' is 'Sticky MAC allow list'\n        - stickyMacAllowListLimit (integer): The maximum number of MAC addresses for sticky MAC allow list. Only applicable when 'accessPolicyType' is 'Sticky MAC allow list'\n        - stormControlEnabled (boolean): The storm control status of the switch port\n        - flexibleStackingEnabled (boolean): For supported switches (e.g. MS420/MS425), whether or not the port has flexible stacking enabled.\n\n        >>> def updateDeviceSwitchPort(serial: str, portId: str, **kwargs):\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --serial STRING       (required)\n  --portId STRING       (required)\n  --kwargs JSON_STRING  (JSON formatted extra arguments)\n~$\n~$\n```\n\nIn the example you will see many arguments described in the documentation, but only two are required: `serial` and `portId`, you can see that by looking in the 'optional arguments' section at the bottom of the help page. Some of the other arguments in the documentation are `name`, `tags`, `enabled`, etc.\n\nWhen the option to provide these other arguments exists for a command, you will see a `--kwargs` argument in that 'optional arguments' section. The `--kwargs` option allows you to insert extra key, value pairs into the command in the form of a JSON string. You do this by providing the argument and JSON value like `--kwargs '{\"name\": \"Data Port\", \"vlan\": \"100\"}'`. At times these arguments are required in order for the command to work. At other times they are optional.\n\n\n### Dealing with --kwargs on Windows\n\nThe `--kwargs` data passed into Meraki-CLI is a JSON string and the JSON standard requires double-quotes in the data for quoting, it does not allow single-quotes. This becomes challenging on a standard Windows command prompt because Windows usually wants double-quotes used to encapsulate a string on the CLI; how do you use double quotes in the data and to encapsulate it?\n\nTo do this, you use regular double-quotes in front of and behind the string to encapsulate it, and you use double-double-quotes in the actual data. That means replacing all uses of a double-quote character in the data with two double-quotes. Your argument ends up looking like this: `--kwargs \"{\"\"name\"\": \"\"Data Port\"\", \"\"vlan\"\": \"\"100\"\"}\"`. It is probably easiest to use find/replace in a text editor to do this for you.\n\nYou can also structure the JSON data and your command a bit if you want to make your command more readable. In Windows, you can do this by ending each line with a carat (`^`) which will allow the command to continue on the next line. Your command in this example will look like:\n\n```\nmeraki switch updateDeviceSwitchPort --serial 1234-ABCD-5678 --portId 24 --kwargs ^\n\"{ ^\n    \"\"name\"\": \"\"Data Port\"\", ^\n    \"\"vlan\"\": \"\"100\"\", ^\n}\"\n```\n\n\n## Making Some Changes\n\nPushing changes into Meraki is done by running the correct command and passing in the required arguments, including using the `--kwargs` argument appropriately when required.\n\nFor example, if we want to change the VLAN ID on a MS switch port, we would use:\n\n`meraki switch updateDeviceSwitchPort --serial 1234-ABCD-5678 --portId 24 --kwargs '{\"vlan\": \"100\"}'`\n\nIf the change succeeds, you will often see the newly updated object echoed back like this:\n\n```\n~$\n~$ meraki switch updateDeviceSwitchPort --serial Q2HP-F5K5-R88R --portId 1 --kwargs '{\"name\": \"Data Port\", \"vlan\": \"100\"}'\n┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ portId ┃ name      ┃ enabled ┃ poeEnabled ┃ type  ┃ vlan ┃ voiceVlan ┃ allowedVlans ┃ isolationEnabled ┃ rstpEnabled ┃ stpGuard ┃ linkNegotiation ┃ portScheduleId ┃ udld       ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ 1      │ Data Port │ True    │ True       │ trunk │ 100  │ None      │ all          │ False            │ True        │ disabled │ Auto negotiate  │ None           │ Alert only │\n└────────┴───────────┴─────────┴────────────┴───────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────┘\n~$\n~$\n```\n\n\n## Debugging and Logging\n\nIf you are having trouble figuring out why something is not working, you can set the debugging level to one of four levels:\n- Level 0 (default): Only warnings and errors will be displayed or logged\n- Level 1 (`-d`): General status and program progress will be reported\n- Level 2 (`-dd`): General program progress as well as Meraki API library debugging will be reported\n- Level 3 (`-ddd`): Program progress, Meraki API library debugging, and full data dumps will be reported\n\nIf you want to stow those logs away, you can define a log file using something like `-l logs.txt`. Only logs printed to the screen will be written to the file, so you also need to set a debugging level if you want to see anything other than just warnings and errors.\n\n\n## Filtering\n\nWhen multiple items are returned from your command, you can filter them by providing a column name (key) and a regular expression to use to match the item's columns value.\n\nFor example, you can view only enabled switch ports on a switch with:\n\n`meraki -f \"enabled:True\" switch getDeviceSwitchPortsStatuses --serial 1234-ABCD-5678`\n\nThe filter (`-f`) argument is reusable and you can use it multiple times to match based on more than one column. By default the filter uses \"OR\" logic when dealing with multiple filters. For example, the below command will show any enabled ports and any ports in VLAN 1000.\n\n`meraki -f \"enabled:True\" -f \"vlan:1000\" switch getDeviceSwitchPorts --serial 1234-ABCD-5678`\n\nIf you want to combine those filters so displayed items have to match both of them. Pass in the `-a` switch to change the filter logic to \"AND\" like:\n\n`meraki -f \"enabled:True\" -f \"vlan:1000\" -a switch getDeviceSwitchPorts --serial 1234-ABCD-5678`\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n## PIPELINING\n\nBeing able to manipulate the Meraki dashboard from the CLI can be quite useful, but its power grows exponentially when you are able to use pipelining. Pipelining allows you to pass the Meraki objects returned in one command into another and do something with them.\n\n> Note: When using pipelining, you will likely want to save your API key as an environment variable since it will need to be available to each instance of the program. Otherwise you would have to insert it multiple times like `meraki -k abcd1234 <commands> | meraki -k abcd1234 <commands>`.\n\nA simple example of this is to display the switch port statuses of the ports on all switches in a network. To do this use:\n\n`meraki networks getNetworkDevices --networkId N_12345 | meraki switch getDeviceSwitchPorts`\n\nThe above command can be interpreted the following way:\n- The first command (before the pipe) is retrieving and returning all network device objects in a network. Each device object will have a `serial` number attribute with it.\n- The pipe between the commands is sending the output of the first command into the input of the second.\n- The second command is taking each object in its input and retrieving that object's switch ports. Since the only argument required by the `getDeviceSwitchPorts` command is `--serial`, and the `serial` attribute is contained in each object coming from the first command, the second is able to use that information to loop through the input objects and execute the command on them.\n- This functionality should be recognizable to anybody familiar with common pipelining in Linux or PowerShell.\n\nIf you, for example, wanted to filter the output of the first command to only output MS250 model switches, you can use a filter in it like:\n\n`meraki -f 'model:MS250' networks getNetworkDevices --networkId N_12345 | meraki switch getDeviceSwitchPorts`\n\n\n### Overriding Values\n\nSometimes you want to use the output of one command to feed another, but you want to change something in the data before submitting it in that second command. You can do this by simply providing the changed argument in the command line of the second argument. For example:\n\n`meraki appliance getNetworkApplianceVlans --networkId N_11111 | meraki appliance createNetworkApplianceVlan --networkId N_22222`\n\nHere you are taking all of the configured appliance VLANs in network N_11111 and are pushing them into the `createNetworkApplianceVlan` to create new appliance VLANs. But first you are overriding the `--networkId` attribute of those VLAN objects so they are applied to a different network. You are effectively copying all appliance VLANs from one network to another.\n\n\n### Translations\n\nAt times the attribute names of objects output from one command do not exactly match the required input names of another, even though the actual data is the same. For example: the output of the `getNetworkApplianceVlans` command assigns VLAN ID numbers to the attribute name `id`, however the `deleteNetworkApplianceVlan` command requires the argument name `vlanId`. To deal with this we have to provide a translation using the `-t` argument. If you wanted to delete all the appliance VLANs configured on a network **NOT ADVISABLE**, you would need to provide a translation on the second instance like:\n\n`meraki appliance getNetworkApplianceVlans --networkId N_12345 | meraki -t \"vlanId=id\" appliance deleteNetworkApplianceVlan`\n\nThe `-t \"vlanId=id\"` argument is effectively telling the receiving program to use the `id` attributes of its input to fill the `vlanId` argument required by the `deleteNetworkApplianceVlan` command.\n\n\n### Outputting Commands\n\nIf you want to test out the power of pipelining, but don't necessarily want to have the commands executed automatically (in case you did something wrong), you can use the `-o` switch to output templatized commands instead. Using the `-o` switch in the receiving command will prevent actual execution, and instead will structure and display commands which will perform that execution; complete with arguments and values. The above command can be safely tested using the below:\n\n`meraki appliance getNetworkApplianceVlans --networkId N_12345 | meraki -o -t \"vlanId=id\" appliance deleteNetworkApplianceVlan`\n\n\n### How the Pipelining Works\n\nThe pipelining feature of the Meraki-CLI utility works by writing standard JSON data out to STDIN; the same data you see if you use the `-j` switch. All log messages are written to STDERR to prevent interference.\n\nWhen the program starts, it checks for a leading pipe (ie: `| meraki ...`): the existence of which would indicate that it needs to process STDIN data, which it then does.\n\nWhen the program processes results to be printed to the screen, it checks for a trailing pipe (ie: `meraki ... |`): the existence of which would indicate that its output will feed another program instance. When this is detected it automatically switches to JSON output and writes it to STDOUT.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nThis project is very new and has been created out of need.
