    "description": "# Macal Package\n\nThis is the installation package for Macal, a Python script Language by Marco Caspers.\n\nMacal was developed for a limited and specific use.\n\nCreating a human and machine readable configuration file that loads data, transforms the data and emits the data.\nLoading happens by calling functions from libraries specific to a particular (Rest/XML) API.\n\nEmitting data is currently limited to the console and SysLog.\n\nIn the tests folder find the test.py utility that contains several tests.\n\n13-12-2021:\nPlease note that this package was previously called pyql, however there already existed a pyql project so i renamed it.\n\nWhats new in 2.0:\n\n- Fully revised lexer, parser and interpreter.\n- Script language now support defining functions.\n- The interface for libraries was changed to make it much easier to write libraries.\n- Published on github in a private repository.\n- Extension for examples changed from .pyql into .mcl\n- Examples in example subfolder\n- Removed http library, may be re-added later\n- Removed external dependancies due to removal of http library\n- Changed interface of syslog commands\n\nVersion 2.0.1:\n- Minor bugfix, validatefunction throws an exception which needed scope to be passed, but the function didn't have that arg.\n- Function Parameters/Arguments for library RegisterFunction now created by FuncArg() instead of ExpressionItem() to \n  make the name more obvious and easier to read.\n\n",
