    "description": "# Macal Package\n\nThis is the installation package for Macal, a Python script Language by Marco Caspers.\n\nMacal was developed for a limited and specific use.\n\nCreating a human and machine readable configuration file that loads data, transforms the data and emits the data.\nLoading happens by calling functions from libraries specific to a particular (Rest/XML) API.\n\nEmitting data is currently limited to the console and SysLog.\n\nIn the tests folder find the test.py utility that contains several tests.\n\n13-12-2021:\nPlease note that this package was previously called pyql, however there already existed a pyql project so i renamed it.\n\nWhats new in 2.0:\n\n- Fully revised lexer, parser and interpreter.\n- Script language now support defining functions.\n- The interface for libraries was changed to make it much easier to write libraries.\n- Published on github in a private repository.\n- Extension for examples changed from .pyql into .mcl\n- Examples in example subfolder\n- Removed http library, may be re-added later\n- Removed external dependancies due to removal of http library\n- Changed interface of syslog commands\n\nVersion 2.0.1:\n- Minor bugfix, validatefunction throws an exception which needed scope to be passed, but the function didn't have that arg.\n- Function Parameters/Arguments for library RegisterFunction now created by FuncArg() instead of ExpressionItem() to \n  make the name more obvious and easier to read.\n\nVersion 3.0.0:\n- Lexer token is now a class.\n- Rewrite of Lexer to greatly simplify it.\n- Changes to parser to take into account changes in the Lexer/Lexer token.\n\nVersion 3.0.1:\n- MANY bugfixes in the interpreter.\n- Several updates to libraries.\n\nVersion 3.0.3 - 13-01-2022:\n- Updated this document.\n- Trying to fix issue with pip where it doesn't go to the normal branch but to legacy?\n\nVersion 3.0.5 - 14-01-2022:\n- Fixed parser issue with comments in blocks (parse_instruction).\n  When a block contained a comment just before the closing bracket the skipping of the comment \n  caused the closing bracket itself to be considered an illegal character.\n\nVersion 3.0.6 - 26-01-2022:\n- Fixed dependancy on Python 3.8.4 and later by removing type decorators for lists.\n\nVersion 3.0.7 - 26-01-2022:\n- Fixed interpreter version # 3.0.1 > 3.0.6\n- Updated this readme.\n\nVersion 3.1.0 - 04-05-2022:\n- Added \"include\" command to the language.\n  Usage:\n    include name[, name]...;\n\n    \"name\" is the filename of the to be included \"library\" without the .mcl extension.\n\n    Any function defined therein can be called. Any variable defined can also be used.\n\n    Macal will try to prevent including files that are already included to prevent having to run an interpreter on the same file multiple times.\n\n\n\n",
