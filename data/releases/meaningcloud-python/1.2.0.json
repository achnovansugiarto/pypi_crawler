    "description": "# MeaningCloud for Python\n\nThis is MeaningCloud's official Python client, designed to enable you to use MeaningCloud's services easily from your own applications.\n\n## MeaningCloud\n\nMeaningCloud is a cloud-based text analytics service that through APIs allows you extract meaning from all kind of unstructured content: social conversation, articles, documents... You can check our demos here: https://www.meaningcloud.com/demos\n\nThe different APIs provide easy access to many NLP tasks such as automatic classification, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, etc. To be able to use the service you just have to log into MeaningCloud (by registering or using other services to log in: https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/login), and you will receive a license key associated to a basic Free plan.\n\nYou can read more about the plans and the features available here: https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/pricing\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can load meaningcloud-python into your project by using:\n```\npip install MeaningCloud-python\n```\n\nYou can also clone the code and type the following on your shell:\n\n``` \npython setup.py install\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe only thing you need to start using MeaningCloud's APIs is to log into MeaningCloud (by registering or using other services to log in). Once you've done that, you will be given a license key (https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/account/subscription). Copy it and paste it in the corresponding place in the code, select the API you want to use and the parameters you want to use, and that's it.\n\nYou can find all the technical documentation about the APIs in the API section of the website: https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/apis\n\nAnd we are always available at support@meaningcloud.com\n\n### Functionality\n\nThis SDK currently contains the following:\n\n- **Request**: manages requests to any of MeaningCloud's APIS. It can also be used to directly generate requests without using specific classes .\n    - **ClassRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud Text Classification API.\n    - **ClusteringRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud Text Clustering API.\n    - **DeepCategorizationRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud Deep Categorization API.\n    - **LanguageRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud Language Identification API.\n    - **ParserRequest**: models a request to Meaningcloud Lemmatization, PoS and Parsing API.\n    - **SentimentRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API.\n    - **SummarizationRequest**: models a request to Meaningcloud Summarization API.\n    - **TopicsRequest**: models a request to MeaningCloud TopicsExtraction API.\n- **Response**: models a generic response from the MeaningCloud API.\n    - **ClassResponse**: models a response from the Text Classification API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the different fields in each category.\n    - **ClusteringResponse**: models a response from the Text Clustering API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the different fields in each cluster.\n    - **DeepCategorizationResponse**: models a response from the Deep Categorization API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the different fields in each category.\n    - **LanguageResponse**: models a response from the Language Identification API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the sentiment detected at different levels and for different elements.\n    - **ParserResponse**: models a response from the Lemmatization, PoS and Parsing API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the lemmatization and PoS tagging of the text provided.\n    - **SentimentResponse**: models a response from the Sentiment Analysis API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and extract the sentiment detected at different levels and for different elements.\n    - **SummarizationResponse**: models a response from the Summarization API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response and obtain the summary extracted.\n    - **TopicsResponse**: models a response from the Topic Extraction API, providing auxiliary functions to work with the response, extracting the different types of topics and some of the most used fields in them.\n\n### Usage\n\nIn the _example_ folder, there are two examples:\n- **Client.py**, which contains a simple example on how to use the SDK\n- **mc_showcase**, which implements a pipeline where plain text files are read from a folder, and two CSV files result as output: one with several types of analyses done over each text, and the results from running [Text Clustering](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/text-clustering) over the complete collection.\n    The analyses done are:\n\n  * [Language Identification](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/language-identification): detects the language and returns code or name\n  * [Sentiment Analysis](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis): detects the global polarity detected in the text\n  * [Topics Extraction](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/topics-extraction): detects the most relevant entities and concepts in the text. If the _get_fibo_ variable is enabled, FIBO concepts will be output (requires access to the [Financial Industry pack](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/documentation/vertical-packs#financial_industry))\n  * [Deep Categorization](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/deep-categorization): categorizes the text according to the *IAB 2.0* taxonomy\n  * [Text Classification](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/text-classification): classifies the text according the *IPTC* taxonomy\n  * [Summarization](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/summarization): extracts a summary from the text\n\n\nThis is what **Client.py** looks like:\n\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\n# Created by MeaningCloud Support Team\n# Date: 26/02/18\n\nimport sys\nimport meaningcloud\n\n# @param model str - Name of the model to use.
