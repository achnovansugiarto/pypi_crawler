Install Starcross gallery using pip::\n\n    pip install django-starcross-gallery\n\n2. Add \"gallery\" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'gallery',\n    ]\n\n3. Include the gallery URLconf in your project urls.py like this with your preferred location e.g. \"gallery/\"::\n\n    path('gallery/', include('gallery.urls')),\n\n4. Ensure a `MEDIA directory <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/files/>`_ is set up\n\n5. Run ``python manage.py makemigrations gallery``, then ``python manage.py migrate gallery`` to create the models.\n\n6. Start the development server and create any albums you required in http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. It's not necessary to create albums if you prefer just a single image feed\n\n7. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/gallery/ to access the gallery. Albums can be added through the django admin interface (/admin)\n\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nStarcross gallery groups Images into Albums, which enables your to organise your presentation. Add albums via the django admin interface, and drag multiple images into your empty albums in the album page itself. It's also possible to use the gallery as a flat image feed only, which is a view published at <gallery base>/images. All images will be displayed here in descending date order. You can add images here directly as well, but they will not be added to an album.\n\nThe gallery was designed with simplicity of Image management in mind, so titles are derived from the file name. You only need to add albums and then drag your collection into place. The idea is to avoid the need to manage your collection both on the website and on your disk. If you wish to reorganise, you can delete and easily re-upload\n\nImages in albums are ordered by the date the photo was taken if available in the exif data, or failing that the modification date\n\nAlbum order can be specified in the Django admin interface. Support for `django-admin-sortable2 <https://github.com/jrief/django-admin-sortable2>`_ is provided, if you want drag and drop ordering in the admin interface. Just installing the module is all that's required. If you have already added albums you will need to use the `reorder <https://django-admin-sortable2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#initial-data>`_ command.\n\nSettings\n--------\n\nOverride these default settings by adding to your settings.py\n\n\n**GALLERY_LOGO_PATH** -- Default: \"gallery/images/starcross.png\"\n\nPath to the header logo within the static directory. If you do not wish to use a logo, override with a blank string\n\n**GALLERY_TITLE** -- Default: \"Gallery\"\n\nThe title of the Gallery shown in the header on the main page and image feed\n\n**GALLERY_FOOTER_INFO** -- Default: \"Starcross Gallery\"\n\nInformation text in the footer\n\n**GALLERY_FOOTER_EMAIL** -- Default: \"gallery@starcross.dev\"\n\nContact email address in the footer. Override with a blank string to hide\n\n**GALLERY_THEME_COLOR** -- Default \"black\"\n\nUse a predefined theme color scheme. Options are black, white, or grey\n\n**GALLERY_THUMBNAIL_SIZE** -- Default: 200\n\nThe target thumbnail height in px. This will vary slightly in rendering due to the justified layout\n\n**GALLERY_PREVIEW_SIZE** -- Default: 1000\n\nThe preview size in px - width or height, whichever is largest. The rendered image size will depend on the size of the browser window, so this should be set high enough to not cause a deterioration in quality\n\n**GALLERY_RESIZE_QUALITY** -- Default: 80\n\nJPEG quality (0-100) of the preview and thumbnail images\n\n**GALLERY_HDPI_FACTOR** -- Default: 2\n\nThe actual preview and thumbnail sizes are multiplied by this number, but rendered according to the quoted value. This enables high dpi displays, such as many mobile devices to show more detail and take advantage of their extra resolution. Some go up to 4x now, so recommended values are 1-4\n\n**GALLERY_IMAGE_MARGIN** -- Default: 6\n\nMargin between thumbnails in px. Some may prefer a less condensed look, so increase this value if your template requires it\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\n**Broken image links after upload**\n\nCheck your MEDIA settings. If the media location on disk is changed, you will need to copy the files in the CACHE directory to the new location, or delete and re-upload the broken images\n\n**Errors during upload**\n\nYour server may have a limit on maximum request size (e.g. client_max_body_size for nginx). This needs to be larger than the combined total of all the images your are uploading at once. Also the timeout may need to be extended as preview and thumbnail caches are generated at the time of upload\n\n**Delay when dragging images into upload box**\n\nIf you are using Firefox on Linux, there can be a delay before the upload box flashes to acknowledge the pending files, proportional to the number of files. You can use another browser such as Chrome if this is inconvenient.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nStarcross Gallery is by Alex Luton <gallery@starcross.dev>, published under GNU LGPLv3\n\n\nAlbum icon by Google licensed CC BY 3.0\n\nFocal Length icon by Ilaria Bernareggi from the Noun Project\n\nOther image data icons made by Freepik www.flaticon.com licensed by CC 3.0 BY",
