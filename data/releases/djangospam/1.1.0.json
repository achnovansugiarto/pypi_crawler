    "description": "djangospam\n==========\n\nDjango antispam module aimed at Django with an invisible fake comment/contact form,\ncookie based middleware and Akismet verification.\n\nSee http://pythonhosted.org/djangospam for complete documentation. Djangospam\nis compatible with both Python 2 and 3.\n\nSee https://github.com/leandroarndt/djangospam for development versions.\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\nThese are the basic steps for using djangospam. You can get more info on\nthe cited modules and at `djangospam.settings`.\n\nFake form with cookie middleware\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n*New in version 0.3.0*\n\nThe cookie middleware uses cookies to identify known spam bots. Simple\ncrawlers usually don't accept cookies, but spam bots may accept, since\na website may require this to receive comments. In order to use the\ncookie middleware, add `djangospam.cookie.middleware.SpamCookieMiddleware`\nto `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` at your settings file (usually `settings.py`).\nIn your template, insert **before** the true form::\n    \n    {% include 'djangospam/cookieform.html' %}\n\nYou must also add `(r\"^somewhere/\", include(\"djangospam.cookie.urls\")`\nto your url patterns (usually in your root urls.conf; `somewhere`\nmay be any path, except the one used for true posts).\nI suggest using the following paths::\n    \n    (r'^comments/', include('djangospam.cookie.urls')),\n    (r'^spam/', include('django_comments.urls')),\n\nFake form without middleware\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nYou may also use the fake form without the cookie middleware. This will\n*not* block access from known spam bots. In order to do this,\ninclude `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`) and\ninsert the following code in your template, **before** the true form::\n\n    {% include 'djangospam/form.html' %}\n\nYou may also define a `spam_uri` context variable with the\nfake formulary destination URI. If no URI is defined, the form will be posted\nat the same address of the page in which the form has been placed\n(it will be used a\n`<form method=\"post\" action=\"\">...</form>`\ncode). The destination address must accept POST requests and should not change\nthe database.\n\nYou may customize the fake formulary by copying it's template to\n`template/djangospam` at your application's directory and editing it.\n\nCookie-based moderator\n++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n*New in version 0.4.0*\n\n`djangospam.cookie.moderator` defines a cookie-based comment moderator\nthat should be attached to\nyour commented model. This moderator tests comment post requests for\nthe djangospam cookie and discards those which don't have it.\nSee `djangospam.cookie.middleware` for more info on the cookie system.\nCode that uses this comment moderator **must** use that middleware.\n\nYour models file should be like this::\n    \n    from djangospam.cookie import moderator as cookie\n    \n    class MyModel(...):\n        ...\n    \n    try:\n        cookie.register(MyModel)\n    except cookie.AlreadyModerated:\n        pass\n\nAkismet\n+++++++\n\n*New in version 0.2.0*\n\n`djangospam.akismet.moderator` defines an Akismet-based comment moderator.\nBesides including `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`),\nyou should insert the following code to your models file::\n    \n    from djangospam.akismet import moderator as akismet\n    \n    class MyModel(...):\n        ...\n    \n    try:\n        akismet.register(MyModel)\n    except akismet.AlreadyModerated:\n        pass\n\n**Warning:**\n    Since version 0.4.0, the Akismet moderator has been turned a separate\n    subpackage. Code using it must be rewritten as follows::\n        \n        from djangospam import akismet\n        \n    must be changed to::\n        \n        from djangospam.akismet import moderator as akismet\n    \n    Using from `djangospam import akismet` is now deprecated and won't be\n    available from 1.0.0 on.\n    \nYou also **must** define the variables below at `settings.py`:\n\nAKISMET_BLOG\n    Your home page URL, including http://\nAKISMET_KEY\n    Your application key at akismet.com\nAKISMET_USERAGENT\n    Your application name\nAKISMET_USERAGENT_VERSION\n    Your application version\n\nResults\n=======\n\nSince version 0.4.3, the cookie-based middleware (with fake forms and\nthe cookie-based comment moderator) has achieved 100% efficiency at former\nhttp://www.correioprogressista.com.br/, which used to have more than 200\nspam comments each day. Even so, I recommend using Akismet or another\nspam analysis tool.\n\nSince version 0.3.0 (first with cookie middleware) up to 8th april 2013,\nthe cookie middleware identified 5166 spammers and blocked 1917 requests\nfrom known spammers at the same website::\n\n     $ grep -c \"BLOCK RESPONSE\" spam.log \n    5166\n     $ grep -c \"SPAM REQUEST\" spam.log \n    1917\n\nChange log\n==========\n\n* 1.1:\n    * 1.1.0 (*2015-02-05*):\n        * Added support for django_comments (former django.contrib.comments)\n* 1.0:\n    * 1.0.1 (*2015-01-10*):\n        * Added support for Django 1.4 and later.\n    * 1.0.0 (*2013-04-01*):\n        * Changed version number and labeled as \"stable\".\n* 0.4:\n    * 0.4.3 (*2013-03-23*):\n        * Fake forms made invisible via javascript.\n    * 0.4.2 (*2013-03-22*):\n        * Akismet settings made optional for non-Akismet users.\n    * 0.4.1 (*2013-03-21*):\n        * Bugfix at djangospam.akismet.\n    * 0.4.0 (*2013-03-20*):\n        * Added cookie-based comment moderator.\n        * Transformed Akismet module into a separate subpackage.\n            **Warning:**\n            Code that used Akismet module needs to be rewritten. See\n            `djangospam.akismet` for the current code. Old code should\n            work until 1.0.0.\n        * Improved logger.\n* 0.3:\n    * 0.3.4 (*2013-03-18*):\n        * Improved forms and URL.\n    * 0.3.3 (*2013-03-17*):\n        * Worked around pip bug.\n    * 0.3.2 (*2013-03-17*):\n        * Fixed new setup bug (setup.py) - NOT A BUG, see v. 0.3.3.\n    * 0.3.1 (*2013-03-17*):\n        * Fixed setup bug (in Manifest.in)\n    * 0.3.0 (*2013-03-17*):\n        * Implemented cookie middleware\n* 0.2:\n    * 0.2.2 (*2013-03-16*):\n        * Fixed bug at akismet module.\n    * 0.2.1 (*2013-03-13*):\n        * Made compatible with both Python 2 and 3.\n    * 0.2.0 (*2013-03-10*):\n        * Implemented Akismet verification.\n* 0.1:\n    * 0.1.1-0.1.6 (*2013-03-10*):\n        * Bugfixes.\n    * 0.1.0 (*2013-03-09*):\n        * First version.",
