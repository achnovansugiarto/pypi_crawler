    "description": "# drf-stripe-subscription\n\nAn out-of-box Django REST framework solution for payment and subscription management using Stripe. The goal of this\npackage is to utilize Stripe provided UI and features as much as possible to manage subscription product models. This\npackage helps you make use of Stripe's hosted UI for customer checkout, billing management, as well as for admin to\nmanage product, pricing, and customer subscriptions.\n\n- Django data models representing Stripe data objects\n- Stripe Webhooks for managing changes with your products, prices, and customer subscriptions\n- Django management commands for synchronizing data with Stripe\n- Django REST API endpoints supporting Stripe Checkout Session, Customer Portal, as well as fetching products, prices,\n  and subscriptions\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n```commandline\npip install drf-stripe-subscription\n```\n\nInclude the following drf_stripe settings in Django project settings.py:\n\n```python\nDRF_STRIPE = {\n    \"STRIPE_API_SECRET\": \"my_stripe_api_key\",\n    \"STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET\": \"my_stripe_webhook_key\",\n    \"FRONT_END_BASE_URL\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n}\n```\n\nInclude drf_stripe in Django INSTALLED_APPS setting:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...,\n    \"rest_framework\",\n    \"drf_stripe\",\n    ...\n)\n```\n\nInclude drf_stripe.url routing in Django project's urls.py, ie:\n\n```python\nfrom django.urls import include, path\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path(\"stripe/\", include(\"drf_stripe.urls\")),\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nRun migrations command:\n\n```commandline\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\nPull Product and Price data from Stripe into Django database using the following command:\n\n```commandline\npython manage.py update_stripe_products\n```\n\nFinally, start Django development server\n\n```commandline\npython manage.py runserver\n```\n\nas well as Stripe CLI to forward Stripe webhook requests:\n\n```commandline\nstripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/stripe/webhook/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following REST API endpoints are provided:\n\n### List product prices to subscribe\n\n```\nmy-site.com/stripe/subscribable-product/\n```\n\nThis endpoint is available to both anonymous users and authenticated users. Anonymous users will see a list of all\ncurrently available products. For authenticated users, this will be a list of currently available products without any\nproducts that the user has already subscribed currently.\n\n### List user's current subscriptions\n\n```\nmy-site.com/stripe/my-subscription/\n```\n\nThis endpoint provides a list of active subscriptions for the current user.\n\n### List user's current subscription items\n\n```\nmy-site.com/stripe/my-subscription-items/\n```\n\nThis endpoint provides a list of active subscription items for the current user.\n\n### Created a checkout session using Stripe hosted Checkout page\n\n```\nmy-site.com/stripe/checkout/\n```\n\nThis endpoint creates Stripe Checkout Session\n\nMake request with the follow request data:\n\n```{\"price_id\": \"price_stripe_price_id_to_be_checked_out\"}```\n\nThe response will contain a session_id which can be used by Stripe:\n\n```{\"session_id\": \"stripe_checkout_session_id\"}```\n\nThis session_id is a unique identifier for a Stripe Checkout Session, and can be used\nby [`redirectToCheckout` in Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js/checkout/redirect_to_checkout). You can implement this\nin your frontend application to redirect to a Stripe hosted Checkout page after fetching the session id.\n\nBy default, the Stripe Checkout page will redirect the user back to your application at\neither `mysite.com/payment/session={{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}}` if the checkout is successful,\nor `mysite.com/manage-subscription/` if checkout is cancelled.\n\n### Stripe Customer Portal\n\n```\nmysite.com/stripe/customer-portal\n```\n\nThis will create a Stripe billing portal session, and return the url to that session:\n\n```{\"url\": \"url_to_Stripe_billing_portal_session\"```\n\nThis is a link that you can use in your frontend application to redirect a user to Stripe Customer Portal and back to\nyour application. By default, Stripe Customer Portal will redirect the user back to your frontend application\nat `my-site.com/manage-subscription/`\n\n### Stripe Webhook\n\n```\nmysite.com/stripe/webhook/\n```\n\nThis the REST API endpoint Stripe servers can call to update your Django backend application. The following Stripe\nwebhook events are currently supported:\n\n```\nproduct.created\nproduct.updated\nproduct.deleted\nprice.created\nprice.updated\nprice.deleted\ncustomer.subscription.created\ncustomer.subscription.updated\ncustomer.subscription.deleted\n```\n\nWith these Stripe events, you can:\n\n- Manage your product and pricing model from Stripe Portal, and rely on webhook to update your Django application\n  automatically.\n- Manage your customer subscriptions from Stripe Portal, and rely on webhook to update your Django application\n  automatically.\n\n## Product features\n\nStripe does not come with a way to manage feature specific to your application. drf-stripe-subscription provides\nadditional tables to manage features associated with each Stripe Product:\n\n- Feature: this table contains feature_id and a description for the feature.\n- ProductFeature: this table keeps track of the many-to-many relation between Product and Feature.\n\nTo assign features to a product, go to Stripe Dashboard -> `Products` -> `Add Product`/`Edit Product`:\nUnder `Product information`, click on `Additional options`, `add metadata`.\n\nAdd an entry called `features`, the value of the entry should be a space-delimited string describing a set of features,\nie: `FEATURE_A FEATURE_B FEATURE_C`.\n\nIf you have Stripe CLI webhook running, you should see that your Django server has automatically received product\ninformation update, and created/updated the associated ProductFeature and Feature instances. Otherwise, you can also run\nthe `python manage.py update_stripe_products` command again to synchronize all of your product data. The `description`\nattribute of each Feature instance will default to the same value as `feature_id`, you should update the `description`\nyourself if needed.\n\n",
