Currently I don't have any aerosols enabled for example, though it's trivial to add.\n\nRight now a lot of configuration features aren't implemented, please request those you want.\n\nReference\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n`Original 1994 Lowtran7 Code <http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/software/lowtran/>`_\n\n* ``LOWFIL`` program in reference/lowtran7.10.f was not connected as I had previously implemented my own filter function directly in Python.\n* ``LOWSCAN`` spectral sampling (scanning) program in reference/lowtran7.13.f was not connected as I had no need for coarser spectral resolution.\n\nFortran (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis is not necessary for normal users::\n\n    cd bin\n    cmake ..\n    make\n    make test\n\nshould generate `this text output <https://gist.github.com/scienceopen/89ef2060d8f15b0a60914d13a61e33ab>`_.\n\n\nWindows f2py\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(this is handled automatically by ``setup.py``, noted here for debugging)\n\nYes, even though you're `using a 64-bit compiler <https://scivision.co/f2py-running-fortran-code-in-python-on-windows/>`_::\n\n    f2py --compiler=mingw32 -m lowtran7 -c lowtran7.f\n\nTested on Windows with `MinGW <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/>`_.\n\nWindows Fortran compile\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNormal users don't need to do this. I suggest that you instead use Cygwin or Windows Subsytem for Linux::\n\n    cd bin\n    cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" ..\n    make\n    make test",
