    "description": "Descriptions can be found in the markdown `README\n<https://github.com/Zaeb0s/max-subthreads/blob/master/README.md>`_.\n\nNew features:\n\nV.0.2.0\n   - start_thread now returns the Thread object\n\nV.0.3.0\n  - Added ThreadStarter Class. This class can run a separate thread for the sole purpose of starting threads with MaxThreads\n\nV.0.4.0\n  - Removed ThreadStarter Class because the new way start_thread is written makes this class obsolete (it no longer blocks while waiting for a thread to become available).\n\nV.0.5.0\n  - Added the ability to prioritize tasks started by start_thread\n\nV.0.5.3\n  - Changed how the stop function works also added a start function that can be called after stop to restart\n\nV.0.5.8\n  - The priority variable can now be a tuple\n\nV.0.5.11\n  - Changed name of start_thread to the more accurate add_task (the old name can still be used)\n\nV.1.0.0\n  - Fixed bug in the stop function where it wouldn't work if the priority variable in previously added tasks still in the queue was anything else than an integer.\n  - Fixed bug in the empty_queue where it would empty the queue then block indefinitely.\n  - Removed start function because tasks are now deleted in the stop function.\n  - Added get_task_queue_count function\n\nV.1.0.1\n  - Fixed bug where a new thread could close before being added to the threads list\n  - Fixed bug where add_task wouldn't start a new thread when it should",
