    "description": "# Minimalistic Gridworld Environment (MiniGrid)\n\n[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white)](https://pre-commit.com/) \n[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\nThere are other gridworld Gym environments out there, but this one is\ndesigned to be particularly simple, lightweight and fast. The code has very few\ndependencies, making it less likely to break or fail to install. It loads no\nexternal sprites/textures, and it can run at up to 5000 FPS on a Core i7\nlaptop, which means you can run your experiments faster. A known-working RL\nimplementation can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-rl).\n\nRequirements:\n- Python 3.7 to 3.10\n- OpenAI Gym v0.22 to v0.25\n- NumPy 1.18+\n- Matplotlib (optional, only needed for display) - 3.0+\n\nPlease use this bibtex if you want to cite this repository in your publications:\n\n```\n@misc{gym_minigrid,\n  author = {Chevalier-Boisvert,
