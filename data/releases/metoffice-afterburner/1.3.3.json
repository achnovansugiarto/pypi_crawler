    "description": "# Afterburner Package\n\n## What is Afterburner?\n\nAfterburner is a Python package that provides functionality for analysing and\nprocessing climate model data, in particular, though not exclusively, data\nproduced by the UK Met Office's [Unified Model](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model/index).\n\nAt present the Afterburner codebase is compatible with both Python 2.7 and\nPython 3.6 or later. However, since official support for Python 2.7 has now\nceased the use of Python 3 is firmly recommended.\n\n## License\n\nAfterburner software is made available under a 3-Clause BSD license, as detailed\nin the LICENSE.TXT file which can be found in the root directory of the Afterburner\ndistribution.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe `afterburner` package depends upon the following packages, each of which have\ntheir own dependencies.\n\n* [scitools-iris](https://pypi.org/project/scitools-iris/) (version 2.1 or later; version 2.4 recommended)\n* [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/)\n* [windspharm](https://pypi.org/project/windspharm/)\n* [sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/) (only required if you intend to build\nand install the documentation set)\n* [nose](https://pypi.org/project/nose/) (only required if you intend to run the unit tests)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe `afterburner` package can be installed from [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/metoffice-afterburner/)\nor [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/). Installing from conda-forge is the\nrecommended method.\n\n### Installing from PyPI\n\nAlthough the `afterburner` package can be installed from PyPI, installing certain\nprerequisite packages (notably `cartopy`) can be challenging. Consequently, it is\nrecommended that you first install Iris into a suitable conda environment, and\nthen use `pip` to install `afterburner` into that environment, but skipping\ninstallation of dependent packages (using the `--no-deps` option).\n\n```\n% conda activate <your-env>\n% conda info -c conda-forge iris==2.4.0   # just to preview package dependencies\n% conda install -c conda-forge iris==2.4.0\n% conda install -c conda-forge windspharm\n% pip install --no-deps metoffice-afterburner\n```\n\nNote: installing Iris should take care of installing the `pyparsing` package.\n\n### Installing from conda-forge\n\n```\n% conda activate <your-env>\n% conda install -c conda-forge iris==2.4.0\n% conda install -c conda-forge windspharm\n% conda install -c conda-forge metoffice-afterburner\n```\n\n### Installing from a tarball\n\nYou may also install directly from the source distribution. After downloading the\npackage tarball from PyPI, unpack it, change to the source directory, then enter\nthe following command (with associated options if required: use `--help` to see\nwhich ones are supported):\n\n```\n% python setup.py install\n```\n\n### Integration with Rose and Cylc\n\nIf you are intending to utilise the `afterburner` Python package in combination\nwith [Rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose) and [Cylc](https://github.com/cylc)\n-- for example, to incorporate an Afterburner app into a Rose suite -- then you\nshould also install those packages onto your system.\n\nIn addition to their respective GitHub project home pages (linked above), both\npackages can be found on PyPI ([Rose](https://pypi.org/project/metomi-rose/) |\n[Cylc](https://pypi.org/project/cylc-flow/)).\n\nNote, however, that the `afterburner` Python package should build and install\nsuccessfully without the Rose and Cylc packages being installed.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe sphinx-based documentation for Afterburner may be generated by running the\n`build_docs` subcommand:\n\n```\n% python setup.py build_docs\n```\n\nThat command will build HTML documentation within the directory `doc/src/_build/html`.\nIf desired, the documentation may then be installed into a target directory\nusing the `install_docs` subcommand:\n\n```\n% python setup.py install_docs --dst-dir=<destination-dir> [--host=<hostname>]\n```\n\nAlternatively, if preferred you can manually modify and run the shell script at\n`doc/src/build_docs.sh`.\n\n## Testing\n\nIf desired, the Afterburner unit tests may be run using the following command:\n\n```\n% python setup.py test\n```\n\nDepending on which packages are installed in your Python runtime environment,\nsome unit tests may be skipped.\n",
