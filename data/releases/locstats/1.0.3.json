Given a programming language and a directory\nlist, `locstats` calculates the amount of LOC you have written in that\nlanguage.\n\n# installing locstats\n\n**Note: `locstats` is only compatible with Python 3.6 or newer.**\n\nYou can install `locstats` via `pip`:\n\n```bash\n$ pip3 install locstats # Only Python 3 is supported!\n```\n\nOr you can build it directly from its sources by cloning this repo:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/kokkonisd/locstats\n$ cd locstats/\n$ pip3 install .\n```\n\nThen you can run it to make sure that it's installed properly:\n\n```bash\n$ locstats --help\nUsage: locstats [OPTIONS] LANGUAGE [SRC_DIRS]...\n\n  Counts the LOC in a given language in a given directory set.\n\nOptions:\n  --strict        Run in strict mode (ignore comments and empty lines).\n  -m, --minimal   Give minimal output (just the LOC count).\n  --silent        Silence all warnings (such as directories not being found).\n  -d, --detailed  Output a detaled list of LOC per file.\n  --help          Show this message and exit.\n```\n\nIf you have installed `locstats` with `pip` but it can't find the executable\nwhen you run it, then you need to add Python to your `PATH` variable. You can\ndo that by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=your-python-path-here/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nFor example, on my computer (OSX) it's:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=/Users/kokkonisd/Library/Python/3.7/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nIf you still can't get `locstats` to run, please create new\n[issue](https://github.com/kokkonisd/locstats/issues) and we'll get to it ASAP.\n\n# using locstats\n\nUsing locstats is pretty simple! Let's say I want to find out my LOC count in C\ngiven all the C projects I have inside my `~/code/C/` folder:\n\n```bash\n$ locstats c ~/code/C/\nYou have written approximately 39590 LOC in C.\n```\n\nBut wait! I try to document the code I write, so there's gonna be a lot of\nlines of comments, which shouldn't count towards my actual _code_ line count.\nI also try to format my code nicely, leaving blank lines where I have to to\nmake it more readable; those do not contribute to the code line count either.\n\nThankfully, I can just run `locstats` in strict mode:\n\n```bash\n$ locstats c ~/code/C/ --strict\nYou have written approximately 28807 LOC in C.\n```\n\nUnsurprisingly, this returns fewer lines.\n\nBut what if I want to use the output of `locstats` in some other script? Well,\nI can tell it to give me minimal output, which will only print the LOC count\n(without the extra text):\n\n```bash\n$ locstats c ~/code/C/ --minimal\n39590\n```\n\nYou can also get a detailed view of the LOC count per file using the `-d` or\n`--detailed` flag:\n\n```bash\n$ locstats python ~/code/locstats/\n__main__.py         : 105 (32.71%)\nloc.py              : 73 (22.74%)\ntest_loc.py         : 54 (16.82%)\ndefinitions.py      : 47 (14.64%)\nsetup.py            : 28 (8.72%)\ntest_definitions.py : 12 (3.74%)\n__init__.py         : 2 (0.62%)\n----\nTOTAL LOC           : 321 (100%)\n```\n\n# contributing\n\nDo you want to contribute to an open source project? `locstats` needs your\nhelp! I've just started working on this project and there are still tons of\nthings to add (mainly other programming languages in the `languages.json` \nfile!).\n\nSo go ahead, fork this repo, write some code and make a pull request :)\n\n\n",
