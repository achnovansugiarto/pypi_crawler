    "description": "# SendCloud Shipping Provider Integration for django-SHOP\n\nThis integrates the **SendCloud** API for **django-SHOP** version 1.0 and above.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nfor django-SHOP version 1.0 and later:\n\n```\npip install djangoshop-sendcloud<1.1\n```\n\n\n## Preparation\n\nAt [SendCloud](https://panel.sendcloud.sc/) create an account.\n\nIn your personal account settings, click on **Settings**. There:\n\n* Add a **Sender Address**.\n* In **Financial > Direct Debit** add your recurring payment settings. There your bank account is\n  charged with â‚¬ 0.01, but this may take a few hours or even one day until everything is checked.\n* In **Selected Shop** select **SendCloud API** with a name of your choice. There, extract the\n  **Public Key** and the **Secret Key** (see below).\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn `settings.py` of the merchant's project:\n\nAdd `'shop_sendcloud'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\nAdd `'shop_sendcloud.modifiers.SendcloudShippingModifier'` to the list of `SHOP_CART_MODIFIERS`.\n\nAdd `'shop_sendcloud.shipping.OrderWorkflowMixin'` to the list of `SHOP_ORDER_WORKFLOWS`.\n\nIf you run **django-SHOP** with partial delivery, replace the `OrderItemSerializer` with the one provided:\n`SHOP_ORDER_ITEM_SERIALIZER = 'shop_sendcloud.serializers.OrderItemSerializer'`\nand change the workflow to:\n\n```python\nSHOP_ORDER_WORKFLOWS = [\n    ...\n    'shop_sendcloud.workflows.CommonOrderWorkflowMixin',\n    'shop.shipping.workflows.PartialDeliveryWorkflowMixin',\n]\n```\n\nOtherwise, without partial delivery, change the workflow to:\n\n```python\nSHOP_ORDER_WORKFLOWS = [\n    ...\n    'shop_sendcloud.workflows.SingularOrderWorkflowMixin',\n    'shop.shipping.workflows.CommissionGoodsWorkflowMixin',\n]\n```\n\nAdd the **Public Key** and the **Secret Key** as provided by SendCloud (see above):\n\n```python\nSHOP_SENDCLOUD = {\n  'API_KEY': '<public-key-as-provided-by-SendCloud>',\n  'API_SECRET': '<secret-key-as-provided-by-SendCloud>',\n}\n```\n\nSince SendClouds sets the Shipping ID for us, we disable that field in the\nbackend, using `SHOP_MANUAL_SHIPPING_ID = False`.\n\n**SendCloud** requires a specific address model, therefore ensure that you \"materialize\" the one\nprovided with **djangoshop-sendcloud** and not the defaults from `shop/models/defaults/address`.\n\n\n## Initialization\n\nCreate two additional database tables as required by **djangoshop-sendcloud**:\n\n```bash\npython manange.py migrate djangoshop_sendcloud\n```\n\nFinally, load all possible shipping options into your shop:\n\n```bash\npython manange.py sendcloud_import\n```\nremember to run this job on a regular basis, say once a week, to update shipping prices.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nWhen **django-SHOP** renders the form **Shipping Method** inside the checkout view, additional\noptions will be available. For each carrier configured in the **SendCloud** backend, an extra radio\nbutton appears. Whatever the customer selects, will be stored inside **django-SHOP**'s `OrderModel`.\n\nIn the Django Admin backend, only after fulfilling the order, a new button apprears named\n**PRINT SHIPPING LABEL**. Clicking on that button fetches a PDF document from the SendCloud API and\nforwards it to the Django Admin interface, from where it can be printed out.\n\n\n## Changes\n\n### 1.0\n* Initial working release.",
