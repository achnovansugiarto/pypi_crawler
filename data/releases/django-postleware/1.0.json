    "description": "# django-postleware\n\nA simple django middleware class which injects a `Cache-Control: no-cache`\nheader onto POST responses.\n\n# Why?\n\nMobile Webkit (iOS4+ and Android stock bowser) has a bug that causes it to \ncache similar POST requests when it clearly shouldn't. Rather than only caching\nrequests that have a specific `Cache-Control` header, it does the opposite and\ncaches the request unless the `no-cache` value is present in the POST response.\n\n# Not working for you?\n\nLet me know by opening an issue or pull request. This was enough for me, but I\nhave read around the webs that other devs needed to add additional headers to\nthe response before it would stop caching.",
