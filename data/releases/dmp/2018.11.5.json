    "description": "# dmp\n\nGoogle's [Diff Match and Patch] library, packaged for modern Python\n\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/jreese/dmp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jreese/dmp)\n[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dmp.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/dmp)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/dmp.svg)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/dmp/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Install\n\ndmp requires any version of Python 3.  You can install it from PyPI:\n\n```shell\npip install dmp\n```\n\n## Original README\nThe Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the\noperations required for synchronizing plain text.\n\n1. Diff:\n   * Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.\n   * [Diff Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/diff.html)\n2. Match:\n   * Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.\n   * [Match Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/match.html)\n3. Patch:\n   * Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.\n   * [Patch Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/patch.html)\n\nOriginally built in 2006 to power Google Docs, this library is now available in C++, C#, Dart, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Objective C, and Python.\n\n### Reference\n\n* [API](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/API) - Common API across all languages.\n* [Line or Word Diffs](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Line-or-Word-Diffs) - Less detailed diffs.\n* [Plain Text vs. Structured Content](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Plain-Text-vs.-Structured-Content) - How to deal with data like XML.\n* [Unidiff](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Unidiff) - The patch serialization format.\n* [Support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diff-match-patch) - Newsgroup for developers.\n\n### Languages\nAlthough each language port of Diff Match Patch uses the same API, there are some language-specific notes.\n\n* [C++](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Cpp)\n* [C#](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-C%23)\n* [Dart](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Dart)\n* [Java](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Java)\n* [JavaScript](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-JavaScript)\n* [Lua](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Lua)\n* [Objective-C](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Objective-C)\n* [Python](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/Language:-Python)\n\nA standardized speed test tracks the [relative performance of diffs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zpZccuBpjMZTvL1nGDMKJc7rWL_m_drF4XKOJvB27Kc/edit#gid=0) in each language.\n\n### Algorithms\nThis library implements [Myer's diff algorithm](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/myers.pdf) which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of [pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/) surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.\n\nThis library also implements a [Bitap matching algorithm](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/bitap.ps) at the heart of a [flexible matching and patching strategy](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/).",
