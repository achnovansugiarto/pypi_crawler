    "description": "Overview\n--------\n\nThe ``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package is a companion package for mod_wsgi. It will\ncompile and install a copy of the Apache httpd server into your Python\ninstallation. If this is done, when the ``mod_wsgi`` package is\nsubsequently installed, it will be compiled against the Apache httpd server\ninstalled by this package. When ``mod_wsgi-express`` from the ``mod_wsgi``\npackage is then run, it will also use the same Apache httpd server.\n\nThis package therefore allows you to side step the fact that most Linux\ndistributions and MacOS X ship out of date versions of the Apache httpd\nserver, allowing you to use the very latest version. It also allows you to\ninstall ``mod_wsgi-express`` where you don't control your operating system\nand so don't have root access, and the Apache httpd server is not\ninstalled, or its companion ``dev`` packages are not installed, which are a\nprerequsite for being able to build mod_wsgi from source code.\n\n**NOTE: Although this package may allow you to install a newer Apache\nversion, it is only really recommended that you use this package if you\nhave absolutely no other choice for getting the Apache httpd server\ninstalled. Always use the Apache httpd server supplied with the operating\nsystem if you can. Building this package if you do choose to do so, will\ntake some time. So if you you think the install is hanging, it is probably\nstill busy compiling everything.**\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install the Apache httpd server::\n\n    pip install -v mod_wsgi-httpd\n\nThe ``-v`` option enables you to see the output as everything is being\ncompiled. This way you can better track that it is doing something and\nisn't hanging.\n\nTo subsequently install the mod_wsgi package and mod_wsgi-express::\n\n    pip install mod_wsgi\n\nTo run mod_wsgi-express::\n\n    mod_wsgi-express start-server\n\nYou can then access the server at::\n\n    http://localhost:8000/\n\nFor more help on mod_wsgi-express see the documentation for the mod_wsgi\npackage and/or run::\n\n    mod_wsgi-express start-server --help",
