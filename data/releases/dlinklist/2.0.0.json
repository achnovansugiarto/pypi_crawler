The major\n        number (1 at this time) changes when there is a paradigm shift in the way\n        the package works (See below TO-DO).  There could be incompatibilities\n        with code written using different major number versions.  The middle\n        revision number changes when important new features are added and the minor\n        version number changes generally for bug fixes and patches.  There should\n        be no incompatibilities between mid and minor version changes.\n        \n        COMPILATION\n        \n        Not much to say here, the package is fairly easy to compile and use. Read\n        the docs for how to use the API.  The INSTALL file explains how to compile\n        and/or install/uninstall both the C and Python packages.\n        \n        LIBRARY USAGE\n        \n        When new code is compiled it will link to libdll.so, and when a program\n        executes it will look for libdll.so.2.  This is why they are sym-linked\n        to libdll.so.2.0.0 the current version.\n        \n        TO-DO\n        \n        The major version will change with the following code changes.  At present\n        the linklist defaults to doing memory allocations for each node created. This\n        is wasteful of resources and time consuming.  It is my hope to create a\n        mechanism to allow larger blocks of memory to be allocated which can be\n        changed on the fly.  This should substantially speed up operations.\n        \n        There is a fully thread safe version in the works, but I have been putting it\n        off for some years now. If ever I decide that it is something that people\n        really want I may continue with it, but for now it will stay in a maybe-will-do\n        state.\n        \n        WEB SITE\n        \n        Yes I have a WIKI for this and my other projects at:\n        \n        http://wiki.tetrasys-design.net/\n        \n        The above URL is my personal page where links to the Doubly Link List can\n        be found.\n        \n        EMAIL\n        \n        Carl J.
