(try/except had been commented.)\n  * correcting the release name (get rid of errant i)\n  * bugfix: there was a crash in sr.py when logs aren´t names as expected.  \n\n**2.20.01b4**\n\n  * there was some debug output in sr.py that snuck into the last release. removed.\n  * bugfix #300 when deciding whether to download use mtime from attribute if preserve_time is off.\n  * bugfix #299

not working at all.\n  * bugfix #296: sr_subscribe list | grep was always empty.\n\n**2.20.01b2**\n\n  * bugfix: race condition where retry.state files might disappear while gathering status.\n\n**2.19.12b7**\n\n  * bugfix #295 sr status crashes if some directories are missing.\n\n**2.19.12b6**\n\n  * bugfix #294 drop messages that have headers that are too long.\n  * work-around for #293 log file descriptors saying on original after rotation.\n  * bugfix #292 errors in example for citypage download.\n  * bugfix #291 default anonymous:anonymous broker user.\n  * bugfix #285 sr

Suggestions bug#70 welcome.\n* sr_post: now works with relative paths, and * etc... can post multiple files and/or directories at once.\n* sr_post: simplified partitioning options:  blocksize eliminated, replaced by 'parts'\n* sr_post: parts 0 - autocompute part size, 1- always send files in a single part, <sz> used a fixed size.\n* sr_watch: events keywords changed: modified->modify, created->create, deleted->delete.\n* sr_watch: event keyword for links:  link - mirror symbolic links\n* sr_watch: added inflight xx  to ignore files until they have not been modified for > xx seconds.\n* sr_watch: symbolic link processing significantly changes paths produced, as realpath no longer used.\n  This should be perceived as an improvement (paths look more familiar).\n* sr_watch: enabled inotify observer (can be hundreds of times faster to notice a change in a large tree.)\n* sr_watch: added *force_polling* toggle option to allow user selection of slower method (polling observer)\n* sr_watch: added *follow_symlinks* toggle option. \n* sr_watch: process groups of events with a single cache lock/unlock.  Provides 4-10x speedup.\n* sr_watch: added 'realpath' option.  Earlier versions use 'realpath' all the time, which changes\n  paths read significantly when directories are symbolically linked.  So default was changed to not do that.\n  Can obtain old behaviour by spcifying this option (listed as a developer option.)\n* plugins: are now stackable, when on_message encountered it is added to the list of plugins, \n  rather than replacing a single one.\n* plugins: added alternate downloading examples:  (download_scp, download_wget,  msg_download )\n  This is used to invoke high speed xfer mechanism, such as bbcp.\n* sum 0: the sum 0 algorithm is changed to produce random checksum, rather than constant 0 to improve load balancing.\n* sr_audit: changed 'role' directive to 'declare' to allow declaration of things beside users.

Caused by the URL fix\n* Add unready list to prevent posting unreadable files\n\n**2.16.11a2**\n\n* fix bug #61: change outputs to better present URL's in logs.\n* just naming of some routines that were imported from sundew, add prefix ``metpx_``...\n* fix bug #54:  Adds interpretation of sundew-specific delivery options to sr_subscribe.\n\n**2.1611a1**\n\n* Another String too long fix.\n* Potential fix for bug #55 (chdir)\n\n**2.16.10a2**\n\n* Fix issue #42 (header length in AMQP)\n* Numerous doc changes\n\n**2.16.10a1**\n\n* Fixes to self test suite\n* Added calls to the usage strings on a bunch of components\n* Added centralized time format conversion in sr_util\n* Added sr_report(1) manual page.\n* Bugfix for headers too long.\n* Patch to sr_poll to prevent crashing with post_exchange_split.\n* Tentative fix for bug #50 improper requirement of write permissions\n* Process headers dynamically\n* Documentation Updates.\n\n**2.16.08a1**\n\n* Major Change: Changed \"log\" to \"report\" in all components.\n* Added test case for sr_sender\n* Documentation Update\n\n**2.16.07a3**\n\n* Ian's fix for sr_sender borked with post_exchange_split.\n* Jun's fix for chmod and chmod_dir to be octal.\n\n**2.16.07a2**\n\n* Fixed typos that broke the package install in debian\n\n**2.16.07a1**\n\n* Added post_exchange_split config option (allows multiple cooperating sr_winnow instances) code, test suite mode, and documentation.\n* fix logger output to file (bug #39 on sf)\n* sr_amqp: Modified truncated exponential backoff to use multiplication instead of a table. So can modify max interval far more easily.  Also values are better.\n* nicer formatting of sleep debug print.\n* sr_post/sr_watch: added atime and mtime to post.
