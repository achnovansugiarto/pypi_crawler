    "description": "Django PostgreSQL Netfields\n===========================\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/jimfunk/django-postgresql-netfields.png\n\nThis project is an attempt at making proper PostgreSQL net related fields for\nDjango. In Django pre 1.4 the built in ``IPAddressField`` does not support IPv6\nand uses an inefficient ``HOST()`` cast in all lookups. As of 1.4 you can use\n``GenericIPAddressField`` for IPv6, but the casting problem remains.\n\nIn addition to the basic ``IPAddressField`` replacement a ``CIDR`` and\na ``MACADDR`` field have been added. This library also provides a manager that\nallows for advanced IP based lookup directly in the ORM.\n\nIn Python, the values of the IP address fields are represented as types from\nthe ipaddress_ module. In Python 2.x, a backport_ is used. The MAC address\nfield is represented as an EUI type from the netaddr_ module.\n\n.. _ipaddress: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html\n.. _backport: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipaddress/\n.. _netaddr: http://pythonhosted.org/netaddr/\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nCurrent version of code is targeting Django >= 1.8 support, as this relies\nheavily on ORM internals and supporting multiple versions is especially tricky.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nMake sure ``netfields`` is in your ``PYTHONPATH`` and in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n\n``InetAddressField`` will store values in PostgreSQL as type ``INET``. In\nPython, the value will be represented as an ``ipaddress.ip_interface`` object\nrepresenting an IP address and netmask/prefix length pair unless the\n``store_prefix_length`` argument is set to `False``, in which case the value\nwill be represented as an ``ipaddress.ip_address`` object.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n from netfields import InetAddressField, NetManager\n\n class Example(models.Model):\n     inet = InetAddressField()\n     # ...\n\n     objects = NetManager()\n\n``CidrAddressField`` will store values in PostgreSQL as type ``CIDR``. In\nPython, the value will be represented as an ``ipaddress.ip_network`` object.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n from netfields import CidrAddressField, NetManager\n\n class Example(models.Model):\n     inet = CidrAddressField()\n     # ...\n\n     objects = NetManager()\n\n``MACAddressField`` will store values in PostgreSQL as type ``MACADDR``. In\nPython, the value will be represented as a ``netaddr.EUI`` object. Note that\nthe default text representation of EUI objects is not the same as that of the\n``netaddr`` module. It is represented in a format that is more commonly used\nin network utilities and by network administrators (``00:11:22:aa:bb:cc``).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n from netfields import MACAddressField, NetManager\n\n class Example(models.Model):\n     inet = MACAddressField()\n     # ...\n\nFor ``InetAddressField`` and ``CidrAddressField``, ``NetManager`` is required\nfor the extra lookups to be available. Lookups for ``INET`` and ``CIDR``\ndatabase types will be handled differently than when running vanilla Django.\nAll lookups are case-insensitive and text based lookups are avoided whenever\npossible. In addition to Django's default lookup types the following have been\nadded:\n\n``__net_contained``\n    is contained within the given network\n\n``__net_contained_or_equal``\n    is contained within or equal to the given network\n\n``__net_contains``\n    contains the given address\n\n``__net_contains_or_equals``\n    contains or is equal to the given address/network\n\n``__net_overlaps``\n    contains or contained by the given address\n\n``__family``\n    matches the given address family\n\n``__host``\n    matches the host part of an address regardless of prefix length\n\nThese correspond with the operators and functions from\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/interactive/functions-net.html\n\n``CidrAddressField`` includes two extra lookups:\n\n``__max_prefixlen``\n    Maximum value (inclusive) for ``CIDR`` prefix, does not distinguish between IPv4 and IPv6\n\n``__min_prefixlen``\n    Minimum value (inclusive) for ``CIDR`` prefix, does not distinguish between IPv4 and IPv6\n\nErrata\n------\n\n* In Django < 1.9.6 types returned in ArrayFields are strings and not ipaddress types. See\n  https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25143\n\nRelated Django bugs\n-------------------\n\n* 11442_ - Postgresql backend casts inet types to text, breaks IP operations and IPv6 lookups.\n* 811_ - IPv6 address field support.\n\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#extended-ipv6-support is also relevant\n\n.. _11442: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11442\n.. _811: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/811\n\n\nSimilar projects\n----------------\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/onelson/django-ipyfield tries to solve some of the same\nissues as this library. However, instead of supporting just postgres via the proper\nfields types the ipyfield currently uses a ``VARCHAR(39)`` as a fake unsigned 64 bit\nnumber in its implementation.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nMain repo was originaly kept https://github.com/adamcik/django-postgresql-netfields\nLate April 2013 the project was moved to https://github.com/jimfunk/django-postgresql-netfields\nto pass the torch on to someone who actually uses this code actively :-)\n",
