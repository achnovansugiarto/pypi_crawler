The original motivation was to enable `dtrx` on Ubuntu\n20.04+, where the `dtrx` apt package was removed from the default ppas (likely\ndue to being python2 only).\n\nI attempted to get the tests all working via `tox` , for which I used a\nDockerfile to try to get some kind of environment consistency. You can run the\ntests by running (requires Docker installed):\n\n```bash\n./test.sh\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Contributions\n\nContributions are gladly welcomed! Feel free to open a Pull Request with any\nchanges.\n\n### Issues\n\nWhen posting an issue, it can be very handy to provide any example files (for\nexample, the archive that failed to extract) or reproduction steps so we can\naddress the problem quickly.\n\n### Releases\n\nReleases are tagged in this repo and published to pypi.org. The release process\nfor maintainers is the below steps:\n\n1. update the version specifier:\n\n   ```bash\n   # update the VERSION value in dtrx/dtrx.py, then:\n   ❯ git add dtrx/dtrx.py\n   ❯ git commit  # fill in the commit message\n   ```\n\n2. create an annotated tag for the release. usually good to put a list of new\n   commits since the previous tag, for example by listing them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   ❯ git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline\n   # create the annotated tag\n   ❯ git tag -a <version number>\n   ```\n\n   be sure to push the tag, `git push --tags`.\n\n3. use the `make publish-release` command to build and publish to GitHub and\n   PyPi\n\nSee the [`Makefile`](Makefile) for details on what that rule does.\n\n### Invoke + Tests\n\nThere's some minimal helper scripts for pyinvoke in [`tasks.py`](tasks.py).\n\nTo bootstrap, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `inv --list` to see\navailable tasks:\n\n```bash\n❯ inv --list\nAvailable tasks:\n\n  build-docker                build docker image\n  push-docker                 push docker image\n  quick-test                  run quick tests in docker\n  rst2man                     run rst2man in docker\n  test-nonexistent-file-cmd   run test-nonexistent-file-cmd.sh\n  tox                         run tox in docker\n  windows                     just check that windows install fails. pulls a minimal wine docker image to test\n```\n\nTo run the tests, run `inv tox`. Takes a couple of minutes to go through all the\npython versions.\n\n### Linting\n\nLinting is provided by [pre-commit](pre-commit.com). To use it, first install\nthe pre-commit hook:\n\n```bash\npip install pre-commit\npre-commit install\n```\n\npre-commit will run anytime `git commit` runs (disable with `--no-verify`). You\ncan manually run it with `pre-commit run`.\n\n### Docker\n\nThe tests in CI (and locally) can be run inside a Docker container, which\nprovides all the tested python versions.\n\nThis image is defined at [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile). It's pushed to the GitHub\nContainer Registry so it can be managed by the `dtrx-py` organization on GitHub-\nDocker Hub charges for Organizations.\n\nThere are Invoke tasks for building + pushing the Docker image, which push both\na `:latest` tag as well as a `:2022-09-16` ISO8601 numbered tag. The tag can\nthen be updated in the GitHub actions runner.\n\n> Note: there's a bit of complexity around how the image is used, because the\n> dtrx tests need to run as a non-root user (there's one test that checks for\n> error handling when the output directory is not accessible by the current\n> user). To deal with this, there's an entrypoint script that switches user to a\n> non-root user, but that still has read/write access to the mounted host volume\n> (which is the cwd, intended for local development work). This is required on\n> Linux, where it's nice to have the host+container UID+GUID matching, so any\n> changes to the mounted host volume have the same permissions set.\n>\n> In the GitHub actions runner, we need to run inside the same container (to\n> have access to the correct python versions for testing), and the github action\n> for checkout assumes it can write to somewhat arbitrary locations in the file\n> system (basically root access). So we switch to the non-root user _after_\n> checkout.\n",
