    "description": "# django-fresh\n\ndjango-fresh will auto-refresh your browser whenever there is an update to any\nof the files in your project. Very useful for development, not intended for\nproduction!\n\n\n## Setup\n\n    pip install django-fresh\n\nGo to your projects `settings.py`, add `fresh` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and add\nto `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` `fresh.middleware.Fresh`. Then open up `urls.py` and\nadd `url(r'', include('fresh.urls'))` to your `urlpatterns`.\n\n\n## Notice\n\ndjango-fresh checks to see if `debug` is `True`, if it is `False` it doesn't do\nanything so it is safe to add it to a production `settings.py`. However, I do\nrecommend following good Django practices and having separate development and\nproduction settings.\n\n\n## License (Simplified BSD)\n\nCopyright (c) Isaac Bythewood  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
