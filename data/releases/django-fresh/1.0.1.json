    "description": "# django-fresh\n\ndjango-fresh will auto-refresh your browser whenever you update to any of the\nfiles in your project. Very useful for development, not intended for\nproduction!\n\n\n## Setup\n\n 1. Install fresh by running `pip install django-fresh`.\n 2. In `settings.py` add `fresh` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n 3. In `settings.py` add `fresh.middleware.FreshMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.\n 4. In `urls.py` add `url(r'', include('fresh.urls'))` to `urlpatterns`.\n\n\n## How It Works\n\ndjango-fresh injects a small piece of JavaScript into each of your HTML pages\nwhich will then make the page poll your Django app checking if files were\nchanged. If django-fresh sees that you modified a file it will tell the next\npolling to refresh the page.\n\n\n## Note\n\ndjango-fresh checks to see if `debug` is `True`, if it is `False` it doesn't do\nanything to prevent you from accidently including it in production.\n\n\n## License (Simplified BSD)\n\nCopyright (c) Isaac Bythewood  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
