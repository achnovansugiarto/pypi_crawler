    "description": "**Multi-Agent Accelerator for Data Science (MAADS)**\n\n*Revolutionizing Data Science with Artificial Intelligence*\n\n**Overview**\n\n*MAADS combines Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (with data engineering task automation) in one easy to use library, that allows clients to connect to the MAADS server located anywhere in the world and perform advanced analytics and embed intelligence in their organization seamlessly and fast!*\n\nThis library allows users to harness the power of agent-based computing using hundreds of advanced linear and non-linear algorithms. Users can easily integrate Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics in any solution by wrapping additional code around the functions below. It can also connect to **Apache KAFKA brokers** using the MAADS-VIPER functions in this library.  \n\nVIPER is currently the only **KAFKA connector in the market that seamlessly combines Auto Machine Learning, with Real-Time Machine Learning, Real-Time Optimization and Real-Time Predictions** while publishing these insights in to a Kafka cluster in real-time at scale, while allowing users to consume these insights from anywhere, anytime and in any format.  We also provide management of algorithms and insights using our AiMS product integrated with VIPER and Kafka, to **help businesses reduce cloud compute and storage costs by tracking and controlling what algorithms are producing, and who is consuming these insights.**  If no one is consuming these insights, AiMS can **automatically deactivate** these algorithms thus STOPPING its use of storage and compute, saving organizations upto 20% in cloud costs. \n\nThe system can:\n\n- Automatically analyse your data and perform feature selection to determine which variables are more important than others.\n- Automatically model your data for seasonality *Winter, Shoulder, and Summer seasons.*\n- Automatically clean your data for outliers.\n- Automatically make predictions using the BEST algorithm (out of hundreds of advanced algorithms) that best model your data.\n- Connect to *Apache KAFKA brokers* (integrated with MAADS and HPDE) to create topics, produce data to topics, consume data, activate/deactivate topics, create consumer groups. list all brokers statistics, and more..\n- Automatically optimize the optimal algorithms by MINIMIZING or MAXIMIZING them to find the **GLOBAL OPTIMAL VALUES** of the independent variables using nonlinear optimization with constraints\n- Perform *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* on large amounts of text data - and get MAADS to summarize the text or apply deep learning for predictive outcomes. \n  For example, you can tell it to scrape a website, read a PDF, or text data and it will \n  return a concise summary.  This summary can be used to refine your modeling and give users  \n  an integrated view of their business from a TEXT and ADVANCED ANALYTIC perspective.     \n  Or, apply machine learning to text data for deeper insights - such as analysing\n  help desk tickets and uncovering issues before they occur. Or, apply deep learning\n  to security logs and uncover more anomalies or threats in your networks. \n- Do all this in minutes.\n\nTo install this library a request should be made to **support@otics.ca** for a username and a MAADSTOKEN.  Once you have these credentials then install this Python library.\n\n**Compatibility**\n    - Python 3.5 or greater\n    - Minimal Python skills needed\n\n**License**\n   - Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhD\n   - OTICS Advanced Analytics Inc.\n\n**Installation**\n   - At the command prompt write:\n     **pip install maads**\n     - This assumes you have [Downloaded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed it on your computer.  \n\n**Syntax**\n  - There are literally two lines of code you need to write to train your data and make predictions:\n\n**Main functions:**\n   - **dotraining**\n     Executes hundreds of agents, running hundreds of advanced algorithms and completes in minutes.  A master agent then chooses the BEST algorithm that best  models your data.\n   - **dopredictions**\n     After training, make high quality predictions - takes 1-2 seconds.\n   - **hyperpredictions**\n     After training, make high quality predictions - takes less than half a second (about ~100 milliseconds). Users can also generate predictions using **non-python code** such as JAVA.  Using the **maadshyperpredictions.CLASS** file, java apps can call the MAADS prediction server to return predictions very fast.  Other apps, using **any** other language, can also call the MAADS prediction server using standard TCP/IP client/server communication protocols like REST:  This gives MAADS users' the maximum flexibility to integrate MAADS predictions in any solution!  \n\n\t You can also use hyperpredictions as an API (Python not needed) and make calls from any application using the following format:\n\t GET http://[maads server website]:[port]/[microserviceid]/?hyperpredict=[optimal algo key],[[input data]],[MAADSTOKEN]\n\n\t MAADS hyper-prediction can also be used in a MICROSERVICES architecture that utilize API gateways (reverse proxies).  This allows organizations to balance loads on the server and manage millions or billions of connections, to hyper-predictions, per day without experiencing latency issues.\n\n**Support functions:**\n\n- **dolistkeys**\n        - List all of the keys associated with the data you have analysed. \n- **dolistkeyswithkey**\n        - List data associated with a single key.\n- **dodeletewithkey**\n        - Permanently delete all data associated with your key.\n- **returndata**\n        - Returns data from the string buffer.\n- **getpicklezip**\n        - Automatically downloads a ZIP file containing the optimal algorithms.  Users can modify the parameter estimates as they wish.\n- **sendpicklezip**\n        - Automatically upload a ZIP file containing the optimal algorithms to MAADS. The optimal algorithms will immediately take effect for predictions.\n- **deploytoprod**\n        - Automatically deploy the optimal algorithms to another MAADS server (i.e. production); MAADS will read the ZIP file, extract the algorithms and make all database updates.  This function is useful when your MAADS training server(s) and MAADS prediction server(s) are separate.  A powerful way to integrate MAADS in a distributed architecture is to automatically train your data, then deploy the optimal algorithms to some other server for predictions.  This is a great way to scale your analytics in a large (global) entreprise setting, seamlessly and fast, with MAADS!\n- **algoinfo**\n        - Get detailed information on the algorithm and other information.\n- **genpdf**\n        - Retrieve the PDF containing all of the detailed information on the algorithm and other information like model explanation and feature selection, etc.\t\n- **featureselectionjson**\n        - Returns JSON collection of feature selection results for easier programmatic manipulation. Use dotraining feature selection switch to return a CSV file of \n\t\t  feature selections.  This function conducts **unsupervised learning** and important part of model building.\n\n**Optimization:**\n\n- **optimize**\n   - Automatically perform optimization of the optimal algorithms by minimizing or maximixing them to find optimal values for the independent variables:\n       - MAADS offers a unique and powerful way to find the optimal values of the independent variables\n       - Users can even minimize or maximize upto THREE optimal algorithms AT THE SAME TIME by building a multi-objective equation with the optimal algorithms\n\t   - By finding the optimal values of the independent variables you can \"prescribe\" the right combination of independent variables' values that will lead to the HIGHEST or LOWEST value for the optimal algorithms\n\t   - MAADS is one of the first technologies to offer a seamless integration between PREDICTIVE and PRESCRIPTIVE analytics.\n\n\n**MAADS-VIPER Connector to Manage Apache KAFKA:** \n  - MAADS-VIPER python library connects to VIPER instances on any servers; VIPER manages Apache Kafka.  VIPER is REST based and cross-platform that can run on windows, linux, MAC, etc.. It also fully supports SSL/TLS encryption in Kafka brokers for producing and consuming.\n\n- **viperlisttopics** \n  - List all topics in Kafka brokers\n\n- **viperdeactivatetopic**\n  - Deactivate topics in kafka brokers and prevent unused algorithms from consuming storage and computing resources that cost money \n\n- **viperactivatetopic**\n  - Activate topics in Kafka brokers \n\n- **vipercreatetopic**\n  - Create topics in Kafka brokers \n\n- **viperstats**\n  - List all stats from Kafka brokers allowing VIPER and KAFKA admins with a end-end view of who is producing data to algorithms, and who is consuming the insights from the algorithms including date/time stamp on the last reads/writes to topics, and how many bytes were read and written to topics and a lot more\n\n- **vipersubscribeconsumer**\n  - Admins can subscribe consumers to topics and consumers will immediately receive insights from topics.  This also gives admins more control of who is consuming the insights and allows them to ensures any issues are resolved quickly in case something happens to the algorithms.\n\n- **viperunsubscribeconsumer**\n  - Admins can unsubscribe consumers from receiving insights, this is important to ensure storage and compute resources are always used for active users.  For example, if a business user leaves your company or no longer needs the insights, by unsubscribing the consumer, the algorithm will STOP producing the insights.\n\n- **viperhpdetraining**\n  - Users can do real-time machine learning (RTML) on the data in Kafka topics. This is very powerful and useful for \"transactional learnings\" on the fly using our HPDE technology.  HPDE will find the optimal algorithm for the data in less than 60 seconds.  \n\n- **viperhpdepredict**\n  - Using the optimal algorithm - users can do real-time predictions from streaming data into Kafka Topics.\n\n- **viperhpdeoptimize**\n  -  Users can even do optimization to MINIMIZE or MAXIMIZE the optimal algorithm to find the BEST values for the independent variables that will minimize or maximize the dependent variable.\n\n- **viperproducetotopic**\n  - Users can produce to any topics by injesting from any data sources.\n\n- **viperconsumefromtopic**\n  - Users can consume from any topic and graph the data. \n\n- **viperconsumefromstreamtopic**\n  - Users can consume from a multiple stream of topics at once\n\n- **vipercreateconsumergroup**\n  - Admins can create a consumer group made up of any number of consumers.  You can add as many partitions for the group in the Kafka broker as well as specify the replication factor to ensure high availaibility and no disruption to users who consume insights from the topics.\n\n- **viperconsumergroupconsumefromtopic**\n  - Users who are part of the consumer group can consume from the group topic.\n\n- **viperproducetotopicstream**\n  - Users can join multiple topic streams and produce the combined results to another topic.\n\n- **vipercreatejointopicstreams**\n  - Users can join multiple topic streams\n\n- **vipercreatetrainingdata**\n  - Users can create a training data set from the topic streams for Real-Time Machine Learning (RTML) on the fly.\n\n- **vipermodifyconsumerdetails**\n  - Users can modify consumer details on the topic.  When topics are created an admin must indicate name, email, location and description of the topic.  This helps to better manage the topic and if there are issues, the admin can contact the individual consuming from the topic.\n\n- **vipermodifytopicdetails**\n  - Users can modify details on the topic.  When topics are created an admin must indicate name, email, location and description of the topic.  This helps to better manage the topic and if there are issues, the admin can contact the developer of the algorithm and resolve issue quickly to ensure disruption to consumers is minimal.\n\n- **vipergroupdeactivate**\n  - Admins can deactive a consumer group, which will stop all insights being delivered to consumers in the group.\n\n- **vipergroupactivate**\n  - Admins can activate a group to re-start the insights.\n\n\n**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**\n\n- **nlp**\n   - Automatically perform NLP to summarize large amounts of text data.  Specifically, there are three data sources one can use:\n       - **Website URL:** you can pass a URL to the NLP function and it will automatically scrape the site and return a summary of the text.\n       - **PDF:** Send a PDF to be summarized.\n       - **Text:** Paste text to be summarized.\n       - This allows users to integrate NLP in unique and powerful ways with advanced analytics.\n\n- **nlpgeosentiment**\n   - Automatically perform NLP to summarize and find keywords for large amounts of twitter data and genenerate a sentiment score.  Users can perform\n     GEO based searches on tweets within a specific radius.  This information could be very useful for risks and threats assessments.\n\n- **nlpaudiovideo**\n   - Automatically extracts text from audio or video files.\n       - This allows users to integrate text from audio and video in unique and powerful ways with machine learning (NLPCLASSIFY).\n\t   - Files must be .mp3, .mp4, .wav\n\t   - Users can specify how many seconds they want or get all of the recording.\n\n- **nlpocr**\n   - Automatically extracts text from image files.\n       - This allows users to integrate text from images or scanned documents in unique and powerful ways with machine learning (NLPCLASSIFY).\n\t   - Files must be .jpg, .gif, .tiff, .png, .bmp, etc.\n\n- **nlpclassify**\n   - Automatically apply machine learning to predict outcomes from text data.  Specifically, MAADS will:\n       - Preprocess text data and convert it to numeric vectors using over 50 Billion words to vector mappings plus custom mappings specific to your trained model\n\t   - Clean your text data by removing strange characters, punctuations, common words, lemmatize the words, etc..\n\t   - Convert the dependent category variable to labels.  \n\t   - If dependent variable is not categorical, you can tell MAADS not to convert the dependent variable.  This means you can regress TEXT data on NUMERIC data!\n       - This function allows users to integrate NLP in unique and powerful ways with advanced analytics to text based systems like Help Desk or security platforms.\n\n**Data Prepping:**\n- **balancebigdata**\n  - This is a very convenient function to extract a data subset from a very large dataset while maintaining its structure.  MAADS will do a very detailed analysis of the data to \n    determine the distribution of the data by binning each variable in a histogram to determine which variables have a good distribution and which ones do not. Using a special algorithm it can effectively extract a subset of data from a **very large data set** which will make it easier for users to use this dataset for MAADS training.  This function can also be very effective in reducing MAADS compute times when training.\t\n\n**First import the Python library.**\n\n**import maads**\n\n1. **maads.dotraining(MAADSTOKEN,CSV_local_file, feature_analysis, remove_outliers, has_seasonality, dependent_variable, maadsurl,throttle,theserverlocalname,summer,winter,shoulder,trainingpercentage,retrainingdays,retraindeploy,shuffle)**\n\n**Parameters:**\t\n\n*MAADSTOKEN* : string, required\n\n- A token given to you by MAADS administrator.\n\n*CSV_local_file* : string, required\n\n- A local comma-separated-file (csv) with Date in the first column.

For example, if you want to minimize TWO optimal algorithms and you want an objective function= algo1 + algo2, then objeq=1,1.  If objective function=-algo1 - algo2 then objeq=-1,-1.  If objective function=-algo1 + algo2 + algo3 then objeq=-1,1,1, etc.  etc.  \n\n*boundslimits* : string, default='none'\n- Sets custom limits on the bounds of independent variable.  The lower and upper limit bounds can be for each variable or a subset of variable. The format must be the following:\n *variablename:[-1,0,1]:[lowervalue,equal,none]:[uppervalue,none]:[i,f]*\n\n - variablename is the name of your independent variable\n\n - [-1,0,1] must be ONE of -1,0,1.  -1 means values of variable name must be all negative, 0 means values can be negative or positive, 1 means values must be all positive\n\n - lowervalue is the lower bound on variable name or equal or none.  If 'equal' you must specify the value in the 'uppervalue' field.\n\n - uppervalue is the upper bound on variable name or none for no bound.  If no bound, MAADS will create a large value using the High value of variable.\n\n - [i,f] means i=integer, f=float, this allows users to specify the types of values for variables.\n\n For example:  If you have two variables named HOUR and MINUTE and you want to bound them, then you can specify:\n\n - *\"hour:1:0:23,minute:1:0:59\"* means hour is all positive, bounded between 0 and 23, AND minute is all positive bounded between 0 and 59.  You can also just specify\n\n - *\"hour:1:none:none,minute:1:none:none\"* means hour is all positive and minute is all positive. Or,  \n\n - *\"hour:1:none:23,minute:1:0:none\" means hour is all positive with no lower limit, and upper limit of 23, minute is all positive with lower limit of 0 and no upper limit.  \n\n - *\"hour:1:equal:12,minute:1:0:59\"* means hour will equal 12 (hour=12), AND minute is all positive bounded between 0 and 59.  You can also just specify\n\n - *Boundslimits* will give users maximum amount of flexibity when specifying bounds for constraints.\n\n  *NOTE:* Variablename MUST match the variables that the model is trained on.  You can retrieve these EXACT names from the function: *maads.dolistkeyswithkey(MAADSTOKEN, pkey,maadsurl)*\n\n\n*a1cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4\n\n- a1cons specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 1.  For example:\n\n  - if a1cons=1, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds\".  Specifically, min <= var <= max\n\n  - if a1cons=2, then MAADS will \"USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, mean-std <= var <= mean+std\n\n  - if a1cons=3, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, min-std <= var <= max+std\n\n  - if a1cons=4, then MAADS will \"USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, median-std <= var <= median+std\n\n*a2cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4.  Only used if algo2 is specified.\n\n- a2cons  specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 2.  For example:\n\n  - if a2cons=1, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds\".  Specifically, min <= var <= max\n\n  - if a2cons=2, then MAADS will \"USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, mean-std <= var <= mean+std\n\n  - if a2cons=3, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, min-std <= var <= max+std\n\n  - if a2cons=4, then MAADS will \"USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, median-std <= var <= median+std\n\n*a3cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4.  Only used if algo3 is specified.\n\n- a3cons  specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 3.  For example:\n\n  - if a3cons=1, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds\".  Specifically, min <= var <= max\n\n  - if a3cons=2, then MAADS will \"USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, mean-std <= var <= mean+std\n\n  - if a3cons=3, then MAADS will \"USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, min-std <= var <= max+std\n\n  - if a3cons=4, then MAADS will \"USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds\". Specifically, median-std <= var <= median+std\n\n*forceupdate* : int, optional, default=0, can be 1, or 0\n\n- forceupdate tells MAADS to update the optimal values.  If forceupdate=0, MAADS will decide if the NEW optimal values should replace the OLD optimal values.  Specifically, if you are maximizing an optimal algo and the new value is LOWER than old value, MAADS will NOT replace old value with new value, because the old value is better.  If forceupdate=1, MAADS will force an update regardless if the new value is better or worse than old value.\n\n\n*iters* : int, optional, default=100, max=500\n- Specifies the number of iterations to use in the optimization algorithms.\n\n*step* : int, optional, default=3, can be 1,2,3,4\n- Specifies how to generate the values of the independent variables for the constraint equations.  For example,\n\n  - if step=1, then MAADS will use a uniform distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.\n\n  - if step=2, then MAADS will use a Gaussian distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.\n\n  - if step=3, then MAADS will combine uniform and Gaussian by averaging to create a distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.\n\n  - if step=4, then MAADS will find values around an epsilon distance, using the standard deviation, around the values that have historically led to lowest or highest values depending on your optimization problem.\n\n*perc* : string, optional, default='min_0_max_0' - 0 means 0%, values should be greater and equal to 0.\n- Specifies by how much to \"stretch\" the bounds on the constraints.  For example, if \"min_50_max_150\", means to lower the MIN bound by 50%, and increase the MAX bound by 150%.  This allows users to specify any size of bounds. \n\n\n**Returns:** JSON formatted information.\n\n- The information contains all of the key details associated with optimization including, value of the objective function, constraints, bounds, initial conditions, optimal values of independent variables, etc..\n\n\n**20. maads.viperstats(vipertoken,host,port=-999,brokerhost='',brokerport=-999,microserviceid='')**\n\n**Parameters:**\t\n\n*VIPERTOKEN* : string, required\n\n- A token given to you by VIPER administrator.\n\n*host* : string, required\n\n- Indicates the url where the VIPER instance is located and listening.\n\n*port* : int, required\n\n- Port on which VIPER is listenting.\n\n\n*brokerhost* : string, optional\n\n- Address where Kafka broker is running -
