    "description": "A package to support resellers.\n\nIt maintains in a postgres database information about providers,\nproducts (called articles),\nclients, orders and deliveries. It uses a Zope2 frontend\nfor user interaction.\n\nIt assumes a single (implicit) reseller\nand several \"provider\"s and \"client\"s.\n\nEach provider provides \"article\"s which the clients can buy.\n\nClients buy articles in \"unit\"s; the provider provides them\nin \"packet\"s which contain an integral number of \"unit\"s. If\nthe \"packet_size\" is different from 1, then the reseller repackages\nthe delivered articles for its clients.\n\nThe reseller continously collects \"client_order_item\"s and\nperiodically issues \"order\"s to a provider consisting of\n\"provider_order_item\"s.\n\nThe reseller occationally receives a \"provider_delivery\" for an order\nconsisting of \"provider_delivery_item\"s and splits them into\n\"client_delivery_item\"s.\n\nThere is a special client, used as stock. It can be used to\nbalance orders and deliveries. It (and it alone) can have\nnegative \"unit\" values in its \"client_delivery_items\" - indicating\nthat units have been taken out of the stock.\n\nUsually, we do not delete items. Instead, we mark them as not \"active\".\nThis is in order not to break references.",
