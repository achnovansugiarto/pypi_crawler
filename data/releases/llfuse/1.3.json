    "description": "..\n  NOTE: We cannot use sophisticated ReST syntax (like\n  e.g. :file:`foo`) here because this isn't rendered correctly\n  by PyPi and/or BitBucket.\n\nThe Python-LLFUSE Module\n========================\n\n.. start-intro\n\nPython-LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE_\nAPI. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and\n3.x. Like FUSE itself, Python-LLFUSE is developed for Linux\nsystems. However, we try to maintain compatibility with OS-X, FreeBSD\nand NetBSD as well (but due to lack of pre-release testers we can't\nguarantee that every Python-LLFUSE release will run on these\nplatforms - please report any bugs and we will try to fix them).\n\nPython-LLFUSE releases can be downloaded from PyPi_. The documentation\ncan be `read online`__ and is also included in the ``doc/html``\ndirectory of the Python-LLFUSE tarball.\n\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nPlease report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion and\nquestions, please use the general `FUSE mailing list`_. A searchable\n`mailing list archive`_ is kindly provided by Gmane_.\n\n\nDevelopment Status\n------------------\n\nThe Python-LLFUSE API is not yet stable and may change from one\nrelease to the other. Starting with version 0.42, Python-LLFUSE uses\nsemantic versioning. This means changes in the API will be reflected\nin an increase of the major version number, i.e. the next\nbackwards-incompatible version will be 1.0. Projects designed for\ne.g. version 0.42.1 of Python-LLFUSE are thus recommended to declare a\ndependency on ``llfuse >= 0.42.1, < 1.0``.\n\n\nProfessional Support\n--------------------\n\nProfessional support is available. Please contact Nikolaus Rath\n<Nikolaus@rath.org> for details.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe Python-LLFUSE source code is available both on GitHub_ and BitBucket_.\n\n.. __: http://pythonhosted.org/llfuse/\n.. _FUSE: http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\n.. _FUSE mailing list: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-devel\n.. _issue tracker: https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/python-llfuse/issues\n.. _mailing list archive: http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.fuse.devel\n.. _Gmane: http://www.gmane.org/\n.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/\n.. _BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/python-llfuse/\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-llfuse/python-llfuse\n",
