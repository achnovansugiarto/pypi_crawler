    "description": "..\n  NOTE: We cannot use sophisticated ReST syntax (like\n  e.g. :file:`foo`) here because this isn't rendered correctly\n  by PyPi.\n\nThe Python-LLFUSE Module\n========================\n\n\n.. start-intro\n\n**Warning - no longer developed!**\n\nPython-LLFUSE is no longer actively developed and just receiving\ncommunity-contributed maintenance to keep it alive for some time.\nUnless you are stuck with Python 2.x or libfuse 2.x, we recommend\nto use the pyfuse3_ module instead - see pyfuse3_porting_ for some\nhints. If you are stuck on Python 2.x, use llfuse<1.4.0.\n\nPython-LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE_\nAPI. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and\n3.x. Like FUSE itself, Python-LLFUSE is developed for Linux systems,\nbut it should be compatible with OS-X, FreeBSD and NetBSD as well.\n\nPython-LLFUSE releases can be downloaded from PyPi_. The documentation\ncan be `read online`__ and is also included in the ``doc/html``\ndirectory of the Python-LLFUSE tarball.\n\n\n.. _pyfuse3: https://github.com/libfuse/pyfuse3\n.. _pyfuse3_porting: https://github.com/python-llfuse/python-llfuse/issues/33\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nPlease report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion and\nquestions, please use the general `FUSE mailing list`_. A searchable\n`mailing list archive`_ is kindly provided by Gmane_.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe Python-LLFUSE source code is available on GitHub_.\n\n\n.. __: http://www.rath.org/llfuse-docs/\n.. _FUSE: http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\n.. _FUSE mailing list: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-devel\n.. _issue tracker: https://github.com/python-llfuse/python-llfuse/issues\n.. _mailing list archive: http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.fuse.devel\n.. _Gmane: http://www.gmane.org/\n.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-llfuse/python-llfuse",
