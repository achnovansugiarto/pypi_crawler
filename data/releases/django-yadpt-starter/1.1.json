    "description": "# django-project-template-yadpt\n\n`django-project-template-yadpt` is Yet Another Django Project Template skeleton for Django projects.\n\nWhile there is no shortage of Template Skeletons for Django projects, the aim of this one is to provide you, to the extent possible, with a fully automated setup using `Docker Containers` and a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your site, all while adhering to recommended best practices. A few key features are:\n\n- Configuration performed by `django-yadpt-starter`, a small utility that makes it trivial to setup your project;\n- Automatic generation and renewal of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificates;\n- Adheres to best practices;\n- Provides different environments: One without a valid certificate for local development and another with a valid certificate (for Production or Staging).\n\nOnce finished there should be 2 templates: a **minimal** but functional template and a more complete template.\n\n## Usage\n\nGetting your shiny new Django project up and running, complete with SSL certificates, is as easy as following these simple steps:\n\n1. Install `django-yadpt-starter` utility\n\n\t\tpip install django-yadpt-starter\n\n2. Create your project structure\n\n\t\tdjango-yadpt-starter.py -e ENVIRONMENT PROJECT_NAME\n\n\t- `ENVIRONMENT` must be either `production` or `dev` _(SSL certificates are only created production)_\n\t- `PROJECT_NAME` is the name you wish to give your project. Bear in mind that this name will be used throughout the Docker environment (volumes, containers, networks, etc.)\n\n3. Add your beautifully crafted code and then start the `Docker Containers`\n\n\t\tcd path/to/PROJECT_NAME\n\t\tdocker-compose build\n\t\tdocker-compose up -d\n\n4. There is no step 4, just enjoy!\n\n**Note:** `django-yadpt-starter` can be run as many times as you like in order to create multiple environments, there are however some caveats:\n\n1. **PROJECT_NAME** must be something unique to ensure that volumes and containers don't collide;\n2. Since certbot is using the [`--standalone`](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone) plugin which binds to ports `80` and `443`, you need to stop any running containers or services that may already be bound to those ports;\n\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\n`django-yadpt-starter` will ask you for a `domain` name. If you require more than one domain (ex. domain.com and www.domain.com) then simply run through the startup script and then, before starting the containers, run\n\n`docker run -it --rm -v {project_name}_https_certs:/etc/letsencrypt -p 80:80 -p 443:443 palobo/certbot:1.0 certonly -t -n --standalone --agree-tos -d {domain} -d {domain} -d {domain}...`\n\n\n\n## Free HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites (Let's Encrypt certificates) using Certbot\n\nFor environments where a certificate is generated (staging or production), [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) is used to generate a a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificate. The only requirement is that you already have DNS setup so that you Django app is already reachable.\n\n**Note:** Given there is a daily cron job which checks to see if the certificate is up for renewal, it's essential the container is always kept running.\n\n\n## Used Third Party Apps\n\n - https://github.com/docker/docker\n - https://github.com/docker/compose\n - https://github.com/fusionbox/django-authtools\n - https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions\n - https://github.com/django-dbbackup/django-dbbackup\n - https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces\n - https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache\n - https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python\n - https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\n - https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy\n - https://github.com/certbot/certbot\n\nSee the files included in the project_template directory for an example.",
