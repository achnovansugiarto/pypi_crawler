    "description": "This package provides support for SAML2 based on ``pyxb``; more\nprecisely the ``saml20`` bundle of ``pyxb``.\n\n``pyxb`` (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyXB) generates a Python class\ncollection for an XML schema and provides means to convert between\nassociated Python instances and xml documents. It is used to generate\nand parse SAML2 messages.\n\nThe package adds support for digital signatures and SAML2 bindings and\nmetadata management.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nPyXB\n----\n\nThis package's version has been tested with version 1.1.3 of ``pyxb``.\nIt may not work with other versions.\n\nClass collections generated by ``pyxb`` tend to be very version dependent.\nThus, they must usually be regenerated when the ``pyxb`` version has changed.\n\nThe current package's version mostly uses class collections from\nthe ``wssplat`` and ``saml20`` bundles of ``pyxb``. Thus, they\nhave a good chance to be updated together with ``pyxb``.\nHowever, the ``pyxb`` ``saml2`` bundle lacks support for\nthe so called SAML2 context classes. This package contains\nclass collections generated with ``pyxb==1.1.3``. They need to\nbe regenerated if the ``pyxb`` version changes (and you use those classes --\nwhich is not very likely).\nThe ``gen.sh`` script in subpackage ``pyxb``\ncan provide glues how to regenerate them.\n\n``PyXB`` currently does not support installation via ``easy_install``.\nYou must install it manually.\nTo avoid failure with an automated installation trial,\nthe ``PyXB`` dependency is not declared in ``setup.py``.\n\n\npyxmlsec\n--------\n\nThe package uses ``pyxmlsec``, the Python binding to the ``xmlsec`` library,\nfor signature support.\n\nUnfortunately, ``pyxmlsec`` is not well maintained. To allow it to handle\nthe digital signatures for SAML2, you must at least patch its source\nwith the patch you can find at\nhttp://lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org/pipermail/pyxmlsec-devel/2010-November/000081.html\nIf you work on an 64bit architecture, you will likely also need the\npatch at\nhttp://lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org/pipermail/pyxmlsec-devel/2011-September/000082.html\n\nDue to the necessary patching, the dependency on ``pyxmlsec`` is not\ndeclared in ``setup.py``.\n\n\nlibxml2\n-------\n\n``pyxmlsec`` depends on ``libxml2``, one of the Python bindings\nto the ``libxml2`` library. This binding is provided as ``libxml2-python``\nby many package systems (for operating system distributions). Thus, you\nmay be able to install it easily for your system Python.\n\n``libxml2`` is not registered with ``PyPI``\n(the Python package index). Therefore, it cannot be installed automatically\n(and we do not declare this dependency in ``setup.py``).\nIf you cannot use a system wide installed ``libxml2-python`` package,\nyou find its source at\nftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/python/.\nUse the version which fits your Python version.\n\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nNote that signature creation and verification will fail with an obscure\nerror message from ``xmlsec`` when ``xmlsec`` is not properly\ninitialized. If default initialization is sufficient for you, then\nyou can call ``dm.xmlsec.pyxb.util.default_init()`` for initialization.",
