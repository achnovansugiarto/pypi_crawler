    "description": "DOcplex, IBM® Decision Optimization Modeling for Python\r\n=======================================================\r\n\r\nWelcome to the IBM® Decision Optimization CPLEX Modeling for Python.\r\nLicensed under the Apache License v2.0.\r\n\r\nWith this library, you can quickly and easily add the power of optimization to\r\nyour application. You can model your problems by using the Python API and solve\r\nthem on the cloud with the IBM® Decision Optimization on Cloud service or on\r\nyour computer with IBM® ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.\r\n\r\nThis library is composed of 2 modules:\r\n\r\n    * IBM® Decision Optimization CPLEX Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.mp\r\n    * IBM® Decision Optimization CP Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.cp\r\n\r\nSolving with CPLEX locally requires that IBM® ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6.3 or V12.7.0 \r\nis installed on your machine.\r\n\r\nSolving with the IBM® Decision Optimization on Cloud service requires that you\r\nregister for an account and get the API key.\r\n\r\nThis library is `numpy` friendly.\r\n\r\n`Documentation <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-doc>`_\r\n\r\n`Examples <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-examples>`_\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n*  ``pip install docplex``\r\n\r\nChangelog\n---------\n\nNew in 1.0.630:\n---------------\n* Added support for CPLEX 12.7 and Python 3.5.\n* Upgraded the DOcplexcloud client to version 1.0.202.\n* Module ``docplex.mp.advmodel`` is now officially supported. This module\n   provides support for efficient, specialized aggregator methods for large\n   models.\n* When solving on DOcplexcloud, proxies can now be specified with the\n   ``context.solver.docloud.proxies`` property.\n* When two constraints are defined with the same name, issue a warning instead of\n   a fatal exception. The last constraint defined will take over the first one.\n* Fix ValueError when passing a pandas DataFrame as variable keys (using\n   DataFrame indexes).\n* Solution.get_values() returns a collection of variables' values in one call.\n* ``docplex.mp.model`` no longer imports ``docloud.status``. Any status\n   previously initialized as ``JobSolveStatus.UNKNOWN`` is now initialized as\n   ``None``.\n* Minor improvements to notebooks and examples.",
