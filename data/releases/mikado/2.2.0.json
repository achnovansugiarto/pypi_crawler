    "description": "Mikado is a lightweight Python3 pipeline whose purpose is to facilitate the identification\nof expressed loci from RNA-Seq data * and to select the best models in each locus.\n\nThe logic of the pipeline is as follows:\n\n1. In a first step, the annotation (provided in GTF/GFF3 format) is parsed to locate *superloci* of overlapping features on the **same strand**.\n2. The superloci are divided into different *subloci*, each of which is defined as follows:\n\n    * For multiexonic transcripts, to belong to the same sublocus they must share at least a splicing junction (i.e. an intron)\n    * For monoexonic transcripts, they must overlap for at least one base pair\n    * All subloci must contain either only multiexonic or only monoexonic transcripts\n3. In each sublocus, the pipeline selects the best transcript according to a user-defined prioritization scheme.\n4. The resulting *monosubloci* are merged together, if applicable, into *monosubloci_holders*\n5. The best non-overlapping transcripts are selected, in order to define the *loci* contained inside the superlocus.\n\n    * At this stage, monoexonic and multiexonic transcript are checked for overlaps\n    * Moreover, two multiexonic transcripts are considered to belong to the same locus if they share a splice *site* (not junction)\n    \n6. Once the loci have been defined, the program backtracks and looks for transcripts which can be assigned unambiguously to a single locus and constitute valid alternative splicing isoforms of the main transcripts. \n\nThe criteria used to select the \"*best*\" transcript are left to the user's discretion, using specific configuration files.",
