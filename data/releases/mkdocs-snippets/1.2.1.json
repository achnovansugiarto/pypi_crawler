    "description": "# Mkdocs Snippets Plugin\r\n\r\nThis plugin allows you to include snippets into your mkdocs documentation.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Organize your snippets in a way that makes sense for you: \r\n  * Multiple snippets per file thanks to YAML syntax.\r\n  * Snippets are loaded from any (nested) directory inside the configured `snippets_dir`.\r\n  * Recursively include snippets in snippets!\r\n* Documentation links in snippets are automatically converted to relative links based on the snippet's location.\r\n  * This allows you to link to other documentation pages from your snippets without having to worry about the snippet's location.\r\n  * Also works with `mike`!\r\n* Snippets preserve the indentation of the snippet call.\r\n  * This allows you to use snippets in lists and code blocks without having to worry about indentation. \r\n* Customizable snippet syntax.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n`pip install mkdocs-snippets`\r\n\r\n`pip install mkdocs-exclude` (recommended)\r\nConsider adding the plugins to a `requirements.txt` file alongside other Python dependencies for your project.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nAdd the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml` file:\r\nIt is recommended to use the `mkdocs-exclude` plugin to exclude the snippet directory from the documentation build.\r\nThis will save you from a lot of warnings about files that are not referenced in the `nav` configuration.\r\n```yaml\r\nplugins:\r\n  - search\r\n  - exclude:\r\n      glob:\r\n        - snippets/*\r\n  - snippets\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe plugin will load snippets from the default directory `snippets` which must be inside your documentation directory.\r\nIt is allowed to have any amount of files and subdirectories inside the snippet directory.\r\n\r\nThese files must be in the YAML format.\r\n```yaml\r\nmySnippet: |- \r\n    This is a snippet.\r\n    It can contain multiple lines.\r\n\r\n# |- is the YAML Multiline Indicator\r\nmyOtherSnippet: |-\r\n    This is another snippet. \r\n```\r\nAll top level keys in the snippet file are treated as snippets. Every key is a snippet ID.\r\n\r\n### Snippet Syntax\r\nThe default snippet syntax is `@Snippet:snippetFile:snippetID@`.\r\n\r\n### Links in Snippets\r\nInternal documentation links in snippets are automatically converted to relative links based on where the snippet is used.\r\nThis allows you to use documentation links in your snippets without having to worry that the snippet might be used in a directory\r\nin which the link does not work.\r\nTherefore, links in the snippet must be written as if they were in the root of the documentation directory.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nConsider the following documentation structure (`docs/` is the documentation's root directory):\r\n\r\n`docs/API/Overview.md`\r\n\r\n`docs/API/Client/Cookbook.md`\r\n\r\nA snippet would look like this:\r\n```yaml\r\nmySnippet: |-\r\n    This is a snippet.\r\n    It contains a link to the [API Overview](API/Overview.md).\r\nmyOtherSnippet: |-\r\n    This is another snippet.\r\n    It contains a link to the [Client API Cookbook](API/Client/Cookbook.md).\r\n```\r\nNo leading slashes or relative paths are allowed. The file type (`.md`) must be specified.\r\nThe snippets can now be used in any file without the links breaking.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the snippet syntax or directory, you can do so by adding the following configuration:\r\n```yaml\r\nplugins:\r\n  - search\r\n  - snippets:\r\n    directory: \"mySnippetDirectory\"\r\n    delimiter: \"|\"\r\n    identifier: \"snip\"\r\n    divider_char: \">\"\r\n```\r\n",
