    "description": "=======================================\nDogslow -- Django Slow Request Watchdog\n=======================================\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nDogslow is a Django watchdog middleware class that logs tracebacks of slow\nrequests.\n\nIt started as an `internal project inside Bitbucket`_ to help trace\noperational problems.\n\n.. _internal project inside Bitbucket: http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/05/17/tracking-slow-requests-with-dogslow/\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall dogslow::\n\n    $ pip install dogslow\n\nThen add ``dogslow.WatchdogMiddleware`` to your list of middleware classes in\nyour Django settings.py file::\n\n    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (\n        'dogslow.WatchdogMiddleware',\n        ...\n    )\n\nFor best results, make it one of the first middlewares that is run.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nYou can use the following configuration properties in your ``settings.py``\nfile to tune the watchdog::\n\n    # Watchdog is enabled by default, to temporarily disable, set to False:\n    DOGSLOW = True\n\n    # By default, Watchdog will create log files with the backtraces.\n    # You can also set the location of where it stores them:\n    DOGSLOW_LOG_TO_FILE = True\n    DOGSLOW_OUTPUT = '/tmp'\n\n    # Log requests taking longer than 25 seconds:\n    DOGSLOW_TIMER = 25\n\n    # When both specified, emails backtraces:\n    # (DOGSLOW_EMAIL_TO can also be a list of addresses)\n    DOGSLOW_EMAIL_TO = 'errors@atlassian.com'\n    DOGSLOW_EMAIL_FROM = 'no-reply@atlassian.com'\n\n    # Also log to this logger (defaults to none):\n    DOGSLOW_LOGGER = 'syslog_logger'\n    DOGSLOW_LOG_LEVEL = 'WARNING'\n\n    # Tuple of url pattern names that should not be monitored:\n    # (defaults to none -- everything monitored)\n    # Note: this option is not compatible with Django < 1.3\n    DOGSLOW_IGNORE_URLS = ('some_view', 'other_view')\n\n    # Print (potentially huge!) local stack variables (off by default, use\n    # True for more detailed, but less manageable reports)\n    DOGSLOW_STACK_VARS = True\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nEvery incoming HTTP request gets a 25 second timeout in the watchdog. If a\nrequest does not return within that time, the watchdog activates and takes a\npeek at the request thread's stack and writes the backtrace (including all\nlocal stack variables -- Django style) to a log file.\n\nEach slow request is logged in a separate file that looks like this::\n\n    Undead request intercepted at: 16-05-2011 02:10:12 UTC\n\n    GET http://localhost:8000/?delay=2\n    Thread ID:  140539485042432\n    Process ID: 18010\n    Started:    16-05-2011 02:10:10 UTC\n\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 107, in inner_run\n        run(self.addr, int(self.port), handler, ipv6=self.use_ipv6)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py\", line 696, in run\n        httpd.serve_forever()\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py\", line 227, in serve_forever\n        self._handle_request_noblock()\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py\", line 284, in _handle_request_noblock\n        self.process_request(request, client_address)\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py\", line 310, in process_request\n        self.finish_request(request, client_address)\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py\", line 323, in finish_request\n        self.RequestHandlerClass(request, client_address, self)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py\", line 570, in __init__\n        BaseHTTPRequestHandler.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n      File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py\", line 639, in __init__\n        self.handle()\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py\", line 615, in handle\n        handler.run(self.server.get_app())\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/servers/basehttp.py\", line 283, in run\n        self.result = application(self.environ, self.start_response)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py\", line 68, in __call__\n        return self.application(environ, start_response)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/handlers/wsgi.py\", line 273, in __call__\n        response = self.get_response(request)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py\", line 111, in get_response\n        response = callback(request, *callback_args, **callback_kwargs)\n      File \"/home/erik/work/middleware/middleware/sleep/views.py\", line 6, in sleep\n        time.sleep(float(request.GET.get('delay', 1)))\n\n    Full backtrace with local variables:\n\n      File \"/home/erik/work/virtualenv/bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 107, in inner_run\n        run(self.addr, int(self.port), handler, ipv6=self.use_ipv6)\n\n      ...loads more...\n\nThe example above shows that the request thread was blocked in\n``time.sleep()`` at the time ``dogslow`` took its snapshot.\n\nRequests that return before ``dogslow``'s timeout expires do not get logged.\n\nNote that ``dogslow`` only takes a peek at the thread's stack. It does not\ninterrupt the request, or influence it in any other way. Using ``dogslow`` is\ntherefore safe to use in production.\n\n\nSentry Integration\n------------------\n\nDogslow natively integrates with Sentry. You can set it up by configuring\nDogslow to use ``DOGSLOW_LOGGER`` and ``DOGSLOW_LOG_TO_SENTRY`` and by\n`configuring Raven`_ to collect Dogslow's reports. ::\n\n    DOGSLOW_LOGGER = 'dogslow' # can be anything, but must match `logger` below\n    DOGSLOW_LOG_TO_SENTRY = True\n    \n    DOGSLOW_LOG_LEVEL = 'WARNING' # optional, defaults to 'WARNING'\n    \n    # Add a new sentry handler to handle WARNINGs. It's not recommended to\n    # modify the existing sentry handler, as you'll probably start seeing\n    # other warnings unnecessarily sent to Sentry.\n    LOGGING = {\n        ...\n        'handlers': {\n            ...\n            'dogslow': {\n                'level': 'WARNING',\n                'class': 'raven.contrib.django.handlers.SentryHandler',\n            }\n            ...\n        }\n        'loggers': {\n            ...\n            'dogslow': {\n                'level': 'WARNING',\n                'handlers': ['dogslow'], # or whatever you named your handler\n            }\n            ...\n        }\n        ...\n    }\n    \n\n.. _configuring Raven: http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config/django.html#integration-with-logging\n\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nDogslow uses multithreading. It has a single background thread that handles the\nwatchdog timeouts and takes the tracebacks, so that the original request\nthreads are not interrupted. This has some consequences.\n\n\nMultithreading and the GIL\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn CPython, the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) prevents multiple threads from\nexecuting Python code simultaneously. Only when a thread explicitly releases\nits lock on the GIL, can a second thread run.\n\nReleasing the GIL is done automatically whenever a Python program makes\nblocking calls outside of the interpreter, for example when doing IO.\n\nFor ``dogslow`` this means that it can only reliably intercept requests that\nare slow because they are doing IO, calling sleep or busy waiting to acquire\nlocks themselves.\n\nIn most cases this is fine. An important cause of slow Django requests is an\nexpensive database query. Since this is IO, ``dogslow`` can intercept those\nfine. A scenario where CPython's GIL is problematic is when the request's\nthread hits an infinite loop in Python code (or legitimate Python that is\nextremely expensive and takes a long time to execute), never releasing the\nGIL. Even though ``dogslow``'s watchdog timer thread does become runnable, it\ncannot log the stack.\n\n\nCo-routines and Greenlets\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``Dogslow`` is intended for use in a synchronous worker configuration. A\nwebserver that uses dedicated threads (or single-threaded, dedicated worker\nprocesses) to serve requests. Django's built-in wsgi server does this, as\ndoes ``Gunicorn`` in its default sync-worker mode.\n\nWhen running with a \"co-routines framework\" where multiple requests are served\nconcurrently by one thread, backtraces might become nonsensical.\n",
