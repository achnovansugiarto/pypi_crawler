    "description": "dstack-tasks\n------------\n\ndstack-tasks is a collection of invoke tasks that wrap common tools and services to make it easier to deploy code.\n\nTools wrapped::\n\n    - docker\n    - docker-compose\n    - postgresql (backup and restore)\n    - mysql (backup and restore)\n    - awscli (s3 only for now)\n    - git\n    - python\n    - django manage.py\n\nThe tasks are designed to run as a standalone console script (dstack) or as a collection of tasks to build on in\nyour invoke and fabric2* tasks.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install, use pip::\n\n    pip install --pre dstack-tasks\n\n\nOnce installed, you can use it from within your project directory. The console script uses a `.env`\nfile to configure itself. At the moment, some tasks still require environmental variables before it can be used.\n\nExample usage\n-------------\n\nTo see list of tasks, use `dstack --list`. To see the help text of each task, use `dstack <task name> --help`. See below\nfor example usage::\n\n    # Backs-up database\n    dstack postgres backup --tag local-dev\n\n    # Release new version of app and publish to S3 (requires ~/.aws/credentials to be set up\n    dstack release_code --upload --not-static\n\ndstack-tasks can also be used as a base library for your `invoke` and `fabric2` tasks::\n\n    pip install https://github.com/fabric/fabric/archive/v2.zip\n\nAll tasks can be run in \"dry\" mode or in a specific environment. To see what a tasks will execute, run it in `dry`\nmode::\n\n    dstack dry postgres backup\n\nTo give your task additional context, you can use the special `e` task to load environmental variables\nfrom a `.env` file::\n\n    dstack e release_code\n\nThis can be used to for example specify a different Github repo etc.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that dstack-tasks is console script build on top of invoke and is thus primarily meant for\nexecuting tasks locally. However, dstack-tasks fully supports being used as a library in your fabric (version 2)\nfabfile.py. Simply import all tasks from `dstack_tasks` in your fabfile and you can execute them on a remote server\nusing something like `fab -H example.com e deploy --version 1.0.0`.\n\nAt it's core however, invoke just wraps bash commands and executes them on the server. This means that for advanced uses\nit might be worthwhile to install dstack-tasks on the server to allow complex tasks to be written in python instead of\nbash. So, instead of running `ls -al` via fabric 2 on the remote server and trying to capture and parse the output, you\ncan use an appropriate python package to get a list of files in a directory.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\ndstack-tasks does not yet include a generic task that can be used to call itself on the server. There is also currently\nan issue with setting runtime environmental variables using Fabric2 to run tasks remotely.\n\n\n",
