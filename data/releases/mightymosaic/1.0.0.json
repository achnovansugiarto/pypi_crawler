The model return a value of 0 on closed eyes, and 1 on opened eyes.\n\n### Create a basic mosaic\n\nHowever, if we want to run the model on picture of different shape, we need either to resize the picture, which is, obviously, non-ideal, are to divide it in patch and run the network on each of them.\n\nWe will start by creating the mosaic, applying the model can be done later.\n\nIt is done by calling the method *MightyMosaic.from\\_array*. The basic usage is to provide only two parameters : the image that we want to transform, and the size of each tiles (here (256,256)).\nPlease note that it is not mandatory to have square tiles, it's just how our network was constructed.\n\nAfter constructing the mosaic, we will try to retrieve the original image. This is done with the *get\\_fusion* method.\n\n\n```python\nmosaic_without_overlap = MightyMosaic.from_array(full_im, (256,256), overlap_factor=1)\nprint(f'The mosaic shape is {mosaic_without_overlap.shape}')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 16))\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.title(f'Image with shape {full_im.shape}')\nplt.imshow(full_im, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.title('Mosaic reconstruction')\nplt.imshow(mosaic_without_overlap.get_fusion(), interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n    The mosaic shape is (4, 4, 256, 256, 3)\n    \n\n\n![png](README_files/README_11_1.png)\n\n\nIf the two images are different, that's mean that I commit something, broke another, and didn't check the results. Hopefully, that didn't happen.\n\nLet's apply the *predict* method and check the result.\nPlease notice that we use a lambda, because the model outputs a (?, 256, 256, 1)-shaped array.\n\nWe can have a *progress\\_bar* to see the progress of the prediction. \n\n\n```python\nfused_prediction_without_overlap = mosaic_without_overlap.apply(lambda x: model.predict(x)[:,:,:,0], progress_bar=True)\nfused_prediction_without_overlap = fused_prediction_without_overlap.get_fusion()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 16))\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.title(f'Image with shape {full_im.shape}')\nplt.imshow(full_im, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.title('Prediction on the mosaic')\nplt.imshow(fused_prediction_without_overlap, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    HBox(children=(IntProgress(value=0, max=16), HTML(value='')))\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n![png](README_files/README_13_2.png)\n\n\nMeh. Not convinced about the results? Maybe it's because of the boundary of each tile, clearly visible in the prediction. And since the left eye is between four tiles, the prediction can't be accurate.\n\n### Create an overlapping mosaic\n\nIn fact, what we want is an overlapping mosaic (meaning that the tiles overlap). And that's what MightyMosaic is for.\n\nLet's create a mosaic with an *overlapping\\_factor* of 2, meaning that the stride, between each tile is only *tile\\_shape*/2.\nOf course, an overlapping_factor of one means no overlapping, and you can increase the factor to any positive integer. However, please note that the number of tile increase with *tile\\_shape*^2, so might want to refrain to use a high *overlapping\\_factor* (it would be quite useless anyway).\n\nAlso, do not use a *overlap\\_factor* that can't divide the *tile\\_shape* (that also means that you want to avoid odd shapes).\n\n\n```python\nmosaic = MightyMosaic.from_array(full_im, (256,256), overlap_factor=2)\nprint(f'The mosaic shape is {mosaic.shape}')\n```\n\n    The mosaic shape is (8, 8, 256, 256, 3)\n    \n\nThe number of tiles is not of 16 anymore, but raises to 64.\n\nOur prediction support batchs, so we will use it to speed up the processing a little: we add a parameter *batch\\_size* with 8 as a value.\n\n\n```python\nprediction = mosaic.apply(lambda x: model.predict(x)[:,:,:,0], progress_bar=True, batch_size=8)\nprediction = prediction.get_fusion()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 16))\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.title(f'Image with shape {full_im.shape}')\nplt.imshow(full_im, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.title('Prediction on the mosaic')\nplt.imshow(prediction, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    HBox(children=(IntProgress(value=0, max=8), HTML(value='')))\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n![png](README_files/README_17_2.png)\n\n\nThe prediction is quite better, without visible borders between tiles.\n\n### About the *fill\\_mode* parameter\n\nCopying the keras *fill\\_mode* parameter, we enable to change the way the mosaic is filled.\nThe possible values are *constant*, *nearest* and *reflect*. Please refer to the [documentation of keras](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) for more details.\n\nHere, we create a mosaic with \"*reflect*\" as the *fill\\_mode*.\n\n\n```python\nmosaic_with_reflection = MightyMosaic.from_array(full_im, (256,256), overlap_factor=4, fill_mode='reflect')\nprint(f'The mosaic shape is {mosaic_with_reflection.shape}')\n```\n\n    The mosaic shape is (16, 16, 256, 256, 3)\n    \n\nOK, we now are ready to plot, side by side, the prediction for:\n- the mosaic without overlap (I);\n- the mosaic with an *overlapping\\_factor* of 2 (II);\n- the mosaic with an *overlapping\\_factor* of 4 and a *fill\\_mode* at \"*nearest*\" (III).\n\nWe also plot abs(II-I) and abs(III-II) to highlight the effects of the parameters.\n\n\n```python\nprediction_with_reflection = mosaic_with_reflection.apply(lambda x: model.predict(x)[:,:,:,0], \n                                                          progress_bar=True, batch_size=8)\nprediction_with_reflection = prediction_with_reflection.get_fusion()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 16))\nplt.subplot(234)\nplt.title('Input')\nplt.imshow(full_im, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.subplot(231)\nplt.title(f'(I) shape={fused_prediction_without_overlap.shape}')\nplt.imshow(fused_prediction_without_overlap, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.subplot(232)\nplt.title(f'(II) shape={prediction.shape}')\nplt.imshow(prediction, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.subplot(233)\nplt.title(f'(III) shape={prediction_with_reflection.shape}')\nplt.imshow(prediction_with_reflection, interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.subplot(235)\nplt.title('abs(II-I)')\nplt.imshow(abs(fused_prediction_without_overlap-prediction), interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.subplot(236)\nplt.title('abs(III-II)')\nplt.imshow(abs(prediction-prediction_with_reflection), interpolation='bilinear', vmin=0, vmax=1)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    HBox(children=(IntProgress(value=0, max=32), HTML(value='')))\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n![png](README_files/README_21_2.png)\n\n\nThat's it.\n\n\n```python\n\n```",
