    "description": "mds-employee-timetracking\n=========================\nWorking time recording for employees, with multiple time accounts, \ntime account rules, automatic pause control and report.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\npip install mds-employee-timetracking\n\nRequires\n========\n- Tryton 4.6\n\nHowTo\n=====\n\nConfig\n------\n- in *Administration / Scheduler / Scheduled Actions* add your company to \n  *Recalculation of evaluations*\n- in *Timetracking / Settings / Holiday* add the public holidays of your area\n- the *time zone* of your company must be set, to show valid time values, \n  otherwise time values are shown in UTC\n- your tryton instance must use cron, otherwise the periodic calculations will not be performed\n\nCreate tariff model\n-------------------\nIn *Timetracking / Preferences / Tariff model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol, save.\n\nTab *Account rule*\n..................\nThe account rule determines the time account to which the working time is posted.\nYou should use a primary time account to which all working hours are posted. \nIn addition, you can create additional rules and time accounts for which \nlate work or night work is booked. Time account rules can be shared between \nmultiple tariff models.\n\n- in list *account rule* click '+' and *new*\n- some values are already filled out, enter name and shorthand symbol\n- for the primary time account you change the fields *from* and *to* to *0:00:00*, \n  check *Sat* and *Sun*\n- in the field *Type of Presence* create the entry *Work*\n- in the field *Time Account* create the entry *Work* - this is the primary time \n  account for your company\n- in the field *Main Time Account* select the time account *Work*\n- save\n\nTab *Break time rule*\n.....................\nThe break time rule causes a fixed time to be deducted as a break for a given \ndaily working time. You can set several rules for different daily working hours. \nIf you are not using break time control, leave the list blank.\n\nTab *Type of Presence*\n......................\nAt time entry, the *Type of Presence* selects the time account rule set.\n\n- in the field *Present:* select *Work* - this information is used by the time entry wizard\n- the field *Site Work* can be left blank\n- save\n\nYou have now created a simple tariff model.\n\nCreate working time model\n-------------------------\nThe working time model determines at which times of the day and on which days your employee \nhas a regular working time. From this information the weekly working time is determined.\n\n- in *Timetracking / Preferences / Working time model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol\n- in the list *Working time rule*, add one or more rows\n- you can create several working time models\n\nCreate/Edit Employee\n--------------------\nAn employee consists of a party, a Tryton user, the tariff model and the working time \nmodel. The *Create Employee* wizard in *Timetracking* simplifies \ncreating an employee.\n\nIf you want to change an existing employee, open *Timetracking / Employees*, \nselect the employee and start the wizard *Edit Employee* via the action button.\n\nEnter times\n-----------\n- the employee logs on to Tryton\n- in *Timetracking* double-click on *Enter Attendance* with the green plus sign\n- click on *coming* or *going* - thats it\n\nIn *Timetracking / Presence time* you can also enter working times manually and change existing \ntimes - if they are not fixed yet.\n\nGet a report\n------------\nIn *Timetracking / Evaluation*, one report per month is created for each employee. \nSelect one or more lines and export them via the report button in Tryton. If the evaluation \nis not updated after you have entered a woring time, the cron service in your Tryton does not work.\n\nEvaluations of the previous month and before can be locked against changes, click on 'lock'.\n\nPermissions\n===========\nThis module adds five new user groups to Tryton. You can combine the permissions with each other.\n\n- *Timetracking - Edit tariff*: The user can create or change the tariffs in his company.\n- *Timetracking - Employee*: The user can enter and fix their own working hours. He can view his monthly report and output it as a report. This group is automatically assigned when editing an employee via the *Edit Employee* wizard.\n- *Timetracking - Edit Employees*: The user can create or modify employees in his company. This includes creating and modifying the corresponding Tryton user. \n- *Timetracking - Edit Worktime*: The user can view and edit the monthly evaluation for all employees in his company. The user can view, change, create and delete working hours for all employees in his company.\n- *Timetracking - Cronjob*: this group is reserved for Cron\n\nToDo\n====\n- extend manual\n- vacation planning\n- support for NFC door device\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n*4.6.9 - 30.01.2019*\n\n- fix: edit employee also corrects the associated company on the cronjob\n- updt: optimized tests\n- new: Time Entry Wizard accepts any number of Presence Types\n\n*4.6.8 - 07.09.2018*\n\n- fix: closing the work time did not always find the right period\n- fix: overlap check improved\n\n*4.6.7 - 29.08.2018*\n\n- fix: entering the end of work by wizard sometimes did not work\n\n*4.6.6 - 04.07.2018*\n\n- fix: exception in overlapcheck of period item\n- fix: bug in workflow transition from 'locked' to 'edit' at period item \n\n*4.6.5 - 18.06.2018*\n\n- add: info about permisions in readme\n- fix: optimize contraints for table *breaktime*\n\n*4.6.4 - 15.06.2018*\n\n- first public version\n- added working time model, break time rules, report, how to\n\n*4.6.3 - 22.05.2018*\n\n- report: added list of additions\n\n*4.6.2 - 20.05.2018*\n\n- added evaluation-report\n\n*4.6.0 - 22.02.2018*\n\n- init\n\n\n",
