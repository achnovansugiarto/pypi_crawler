You can combine the permissions with each other.\n\n- *Timetracking - Edit tariff*: The user can create or change the tariffs in his company.\n- *Timetracking - Employee*: The user can enter and fix their own working hours. He can view his monthly report and output it as a report.\n- *Timetracking - Edit Employees*: The user can create or modify employees in his company. This includes creating and modifying the corresponding Tryton user. This group is automatically assigned when editing an employee via the *Edit Employee* wizard.\n- *Timetracking - Edit Worktime*: The user can view and edit the monthly evaluation for all employees in his company.
