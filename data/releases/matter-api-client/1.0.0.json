    "description": "# matter-api-client\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [License](./LICENSE)\n\n## Background\n\nThe Matter API Client Library in Python is a comprehensive tool for making HTTP/HTTPS API calls to other web services. It is designed to simplify the process of making API calls and handling the responses. The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their use case.\n\nOne of the key features of the library is its ability to send JSON payloads, making it easy to work with APIs that require JSON data. It also automatically parses JSON responses, saving developers time and effort.\n\nThe library is designed with reliability in mind. It includes built-in error handling to catch client connection errors and throw exceptions when necessary. This ensures that developers can quickly identify and fix issues that may arise during API calls.\n\nTo further improve reliability, the library includes auto-retry functionality. This means that if an API call fails due to a network issue or other transient error, the library will automatically retry the call. This helps to ensure that the application can continue to function even in the face of occasional network disruptions.\n\nOverall, the Python API Client Library is a powerful and flexible tool that can help developers to quickly and easily integrate with a wide range of APIs. With support for JSON payloads, automatic parsing of responses, error handling, and auto-retries, it is a reliable and robust solution for any project that requires API integration.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```console\npip install matter-api-client\n```\n\nAlso, make sure to set the following ENV variables:\n```console\nSERVER_LOG_LEVEL=debug or info or error\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Sync API Calls:\n\nGet:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client import get\nresult = get(url=\"some url\")\n```\n\nPost:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client import post\nresult = post(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\nPut:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client import put\nresult = put(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\nDelete:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client import delete\nresult = delete(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\n### Async API Calls:\n\nGet:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client_async import get\nresult = await get(url=\"some url\")\n```\n\nPost:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client_async import post\nresult = await post(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\nPut:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client_async import put\nresult = await put(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\nDelete:\n```python\nfrom matter_api_client.http_client_async import delete\nresult = await delete(url=\"some url\", payload=payload, headers=headers)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nMake sure you have all supported python versions installed in your machine:\n\n* 3.10\n* 3.11\n\n### Install hatch in your system\n\n```https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/```\n\n### Create the environment\n\n```console\nhatch env create\n```\n\nDo your changes...\n\n### Run the tests\n\n```console\nhatch run test\n```\n\nThe command above will run the tests against all supported python versions\ninstalled in your machine. For testing in other operating system you may use the\nconfigured CI in github. \n\n### Bump a new version\n\nIn general, you just need to execute:\n\n```console\nhatch version\n```\n\nThis command will update the minor version. i.e.:\nNo breaking changes and new feature has been added\n\nWe are using [semantic version](https://semver.org/), if you are doing a bug fix:\n\n```console\nhatch version fix\n```\n\n## Github workflows\n\nIf you want to reuse fully the github actions defined by this template make sure your [workflow permissions for Actions](../../settings/actions) settings is configured as followed: \n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349498/227478670-37eed4c1-151a-4bd7-8e97-ed3395047942.png)\n\n",
