    "description": "# mintapi\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/mintapi/mintapi/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mintapi/mintapi/actions)\n[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mintapi)](https://pypi.org/project/mintapi/)\n[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\n\nAn unofficial screen-scraping API for Mint.com.\n\n## IMPORTANT: mintapi 2.0 vs 1.x\n\nWe recently released 2.0, which supports (and only supports) the new Mint UI:\n\n * If your account has the new UI with the nav on the *left*, you'll need to install at least 2.0: `pip install mintapi>=2.0`\n * If your account still has the original UI with the nav on *top*, to use 2.0, you will need to specify `--beta` in your command-line options or submit `beta=True` when initializing the class.  Otherwise, please install the latest 1.x release: `pip install mintapi<2.0`\n\nPlease note that due to data changes on the Mint.com side as well as various new features and changes on the mintapi side, there are several breaking changes in 2.0. Please see [the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mintapi/mintapi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n\n## Community\n\nPlease [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/YjJEuJRAu9) to get help or just chat with fellow mintapi users :)\n\n## Installation\n\nEnsure you have Python 3 and pip (`easy_install pip`) and then:\n\n```shell\npip install mintapi\n```\n\n`mintapi` scrapes Mint.com by navigating a Chrome browser (or Chromium) just as a human would. Once logged in, the API allows programatic access to various Mint REST APIs. Selenium/WebDriver is used to accomplish this, and specifically, ChromeDriver under the hood. `mintapi` will download the latest stable release of chromedriver, unless --use_chromedriver_on_path is given. **NOTE: You must have [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/) installed, on the `stable` track, and be up-to-date!** If you run into a `SessionNotCreatedException` about \"ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version XX\", you need to [update Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414).\n\n## Usage\n\n### From the Command Line\n\nFrom the command line, the most automated invocation will be:\n\n    mintapi --keyring --headless you@example.com\n\nThis will store your credentials securely in your system keyring, and use a\nheadless (invisible) browser to log in and grab the account data. If this triggers\nan MFA prompt, you'll be prompted on the command line for your code, which by default\ngoes to SMS unless you specify `--mfa-method=email`. This will also persist a browser\nsession in $HOME/.mintapi/session to avoid an MFA in the future, unless you specify `--session-path=None`.\n\nIf you wish to simplify the number of arguments passed in the command line, you can use a configuration file by specifying `--config-file`.  For arguments such as `--transactions`, you can add a line in your config file that says `transactions`.  For other arguments that have input, such as `--start-date`, you would add a line such as `start-date=10/01/21`.  There are two exceptions to what you can add to the config file: email and password.  Since these arguments do not include `--`, you cannot add them to the config file.\n\n### Linux Distributions (including Raspberry Pi OS)\n\nIf you're running mintapi in a server environment on an automatic schedule, consider running mintapi in headless mode if you don't need to see the login workflow. In addition, you'll want to use your distribution's package manager to install chromium and chromedriver. Make sure your distribution is up-to-date and then install/update Chromium (debian-family example): `apt install chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver`. Then use the option `use_chromedriver_on_path` either through the CLI or the python api so that mintapi doesn't try to find a matching chromedriver.\n\nIf you need to download the chromedriver manually, be sure to get the version that matches your chrome version and make the chromedriver available to your python interpreter either by putting the chromedriver in your python working directory or inside your `PATH` as described in the [python selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html#drivers).\n\n### General Automation Scenarios\n\nWhen running this inside of a cron job or other long-term automation scripts, it might be helpful to specify chrome and chromedriver executables so as not to conflict with other chrome versions you may have. Selenium by default just gets these from your `PATH` environment variable, so customizing your environment can force a deterministic behavior from mintapi. To use a different browser besides Chrome or Chromium, see the [python api](#from-python). Below are two examples.\n\n#### Unix Environment\n\nIf I wanted to make sure that mintapi used the chromium executable in my /usr/bin directory when executing a cron job, I could write the following cron line:\n```cron\n0 7 * * FRI PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH mintapi --headless john@example.com my_password\n```\nwhere prepending the /usr/bin path to path will make those binaries found first. This will only affect the cron job and will not change the environment for any other process.\n\n#### Windows Environment\n\nYou can do a similar thing in windows by executing the following in Powershell.\n\n```powershell\n$ENV:PATH = \"C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome;$ENV:PATH\"\nmintapi --headless john@example.com my_password\n```\n\n#### Docker Image\n\nYou can also use the docker image to help manage your environment so you don't have to worry about chrome or chromedriver versions. There are a few caveats:\n1. Headless mode is recommended. GUI works but introduces the need to configure an X11 server which varies with setup. Google is your friend.\n2. Almost always use the flag `--use-chromedriver-on-path` as the chrome and chromedriver built into the docker image already match and getting the latest will break the image.\n3. If you want to persist credentials or your chrome session, you'll need to do some volume mounting.\n\nTo use the image:\n```\ndocker run --rm --shm-size=2g ghcr.io/mintapi/mintapi mintapi john@example.com my_password --headless --use-chromedriver-on-path\n```\n\n#### AWS Lambda Environment\n\nAWS Lambda may need a [specific chrome driver with specific options](https://robertorocha.info/setting-up-a-selenium-web-scraper-on-aws-lambda-with-python/). You can initialize Mint with the pre-configured headless serverless chrome through the constructor:\n\n\n```python\ndriver = initialize_serverless_chrome_driver(...)\nmint = mintapi.Mint(..., driver=driver)\n...\n```\n\n\n### MFA Authentication Methods\n\nAs of v2.0, `mfa_method` is only required if your login flow presents you with the option to select which Multifactor Authentication Method you wish to use, typically as a result of your account configured to accept different methods.  \n\nIf `mintapi` detects that your Mint account uses IMAP and your email host provides IMAP access, you can specify your IMAP login details.  This will automate the retrieval of the MFA code from your email and entering it into Mint.  If you use IMAP in conjunction with `keyring`, then you can store your IMAP password (`imap-password`) in keyring.  To do so, simply omit `imap-password` and you will initially be prompted for the password associated with your IMAP account.  Then, on subsequent uses of your IMAP account, you will not have to specify your password.\n\nIf `mfa-method` is soft-token then you must also pass your `mfa-token`. The `mfa-token` can be obtained by going to [your mint.com settings](https://mint.intuit.com/settings.event?filter=all) and clicking on 'Intuit Account'. From there go to *Sign In & Security* -> *Two-step verification*. From there, enable the top option however you wish (either text or email is fine). After that, start the process to enable the *Authenticator app* option and when you get the part where you see the QR code, **copy the manual setup code** that appears next to it. Careful where you store this as it allows anyone to generate TOTP codes. This is the token that you will pass to `mfa-token` in either the python api or from the command line.\n\nWhile Mint supports authentication via Voice, `mintapi` does not currently support this option.  Compatability with this method will be added in a later version.\n\n### Multi-Data Support\n\nAs of v2.0, mintapi supports returning multiple types of data in one call, such as: `mintapi --accounts --budgets --transactions`.  When exporting multiple data types, you can either send it directly to `stdout` or you can export to a file via `--filename`.  mintapi will create a file for each type of data, with a suffix based on the format.  For example, if you run `mintapi --accounts --transactions --filename=current --format=csv`, then you will receive two files: `current_account.csv` and `current_transaction.csv`.  The following table outlines the option selected and its corresponding suffix:\n\n| Option       | Suffix       |\n| -----------  | -----------  |\n| accounts     | account      |\n| budgets      | budget       |\n| transactions | transaction  |\n| categories   | category     |\n| investments  | investment   |\n| net-worth    | net_worth    |\n| credit-score | credit_score |\n| credit-report| credit_report|\n\n\n### From Python\n\nFrom python, instantiate the Mint class (from the mintapi package) and you can\nmake calls to retrieve account/budget information.  We recommend using the\n`keyring` library for persisting credentials.\n\n```python\n  import mintapi\n  mint = mintapi.Mint(\n    'your_email@web.com',  # Email used to log in to Mint\n    'password',  # Your password used to log in to mint\n    # Optional parameters\n    mfa_method='sms',  # See MFA Methods section\n                       # Can be 'sms' (default), 'email', or 'soft-token'.\n                       # if mintapi detects an MFA request, it will trigger the requested method\n                       # and prompt on the command line.\n    mfa_input_callback=None,  # see MFA Methods section\n                              # can be used with any mfa_method\n                              # A callback accepting a single argument (the prompt)\n                              # which returns the user-inputted 2FA code.
