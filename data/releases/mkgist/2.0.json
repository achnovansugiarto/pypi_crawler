    "description": "# mkgist\n\nA small utility for making gists. When I need to share code snippets online, the formatting always ends up totally messed up when I copy-paste manually. This alleviates that.\n\n## Setup\n\nFor general use, it's a good idea to keep it somewhere in your path. Because the endpoint requires authentication, you should create a JSON file with your credentials called `.mkgist.conf` at the home directory. For example,\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\": \"user\",\n  \"password\": \"password\"\n}\n```\n\nTo install dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after installing. I don't use this within a virtual environment, but doing so would look something like this:\n\n```\nvirtualenv -p $(which python3) $HOME/virtualenv/mkgist\nsource $HOME/virtualenv/mkgist/bin/activate\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n    mkgist filenames [-d \"description\"] [--public] [--raw] [--nocopy]\n\n- If no filenames are entered, the contents of the gist are read from STDIN.\n- The location of the created gist is printed to stdout.\n- Gists are secret by default, but can be made public with `--public`. (Secret gists aren't indexed by search engines)\n- `--raw` returns a link to the raw hosted file, which you can then get with `curl` or `wget`. If multiple files are created with this flag, the URLs are always printed to stdout.\n- By default, the URL of the created Gist is copied to the clipboard. `--nocopy` prints the link to stdout instead, not overwriting the clipboard.\n\n\n",
