    "description": "This is my first program that I have ever distributed...\n\nConstructive criticism is welcome.\n\nThe source code for this project is available here:\n<https://github.com/myson1515/DYGI>\n\nThis is an email client for Unix users that do not have a GUI for their OS.  An example of this may be Arch Linux or any distro of that sort.  This program only works for gmail users and is 100% text-based.  The program is very self explanitory it comes with the following features:\n\n1. An inbox to view emails\n2. A way to write and send emails \n3. A logout button.\n\nYou can navigate through these features using CTRL-X and the OK and CANCEL buttons in the bottom right.\n\nThese are the features this program doesn't have but will possibly come soon depending on your input:\n\n1. A respond button.\n2. An index to look through email folders.\n\nThis software has been tested on Windows and Linux and should work on a Mac.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  Please make sure access to less secure apps is switched to \"on\" if you want to use this email client.\n\nThanks for using the software.  My name is Mason Lapine.\nYou can contact me on GitHub for any bugs or suggestions or email me.",
