conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian (with more languages soon to come) using Machine Learning techniques. üß†\n\nThe mlconjug3 project is now a proud member of the ARS Linguistica organization. ü§ù ARS Linguistica is a community-driven, open source project that aims to develop free and accessible linguistic tools and resources for all. üåç With a focus on advancing linguistic research, documentation, and education, ARS Linguistica is dedicated to preserving and promoting linguistic diversity through the use of open source and open science. üí°\n\nWith mlconjug3, you can:\n\n- Conjugate any verb in one of the supported languages, even completely new or made-up verbs, with the help of a pre-trained Machine Learning model. üí™\n- Easily modify and retrain the models using any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn. üîß\n- Integrate mlconjug3 in your own projects. üß¨\n\n\nUsing mlconjug3 in Academic Research\n------------------------------------\n\nmlconjug3 is a valuable tool for linguistic researchers, as it provides accurate and up-to-date conjugation information for a wide range of languages. üß™ With its ability to handle completely new or made-up verbs, mlconjug3 is perfect for exploring new linguistic concepts and theories. üîç It can also be used to compare and contrast conjugation patterns across different languages, helping researchers to identify and understand linguistic trends.\n\nIntegrating mlconjug3 in Applications\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to academic research, mlconjug3 can be integrated into a wide range of web and desktop applications. üíª For language learning platforms, mlconjug3 provides an accurate and comprehensive source of conjugation information, helping students to quickly and easily master verb conjugation. üìö For language translation tools, mlconjug3 can help to ensure that translations are grammatically correct, by providing accurate verb conjugation information in real-time. üí¨\n\nBy using mlconjug3, you are not only getting a powerful and flexible tool for verb conjugation, but you are also supporting the goals and mission of ARS Linguistica. üôå Whether you are a linguistic researcher, language teacher, or simply someone who is passionate about preserving linguistic heritage, your support is crucial to the success of our organization. \n\nJoin us in our mission to make linguistic tools and resources accessible to all! üí™\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n.. image::

This is to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the package, and to provide an added layer of security for our users.\n\nSigning a software package is a way to ensure that the package has not been tampered with and that it comes from a trusted source. This is important because malicious actors may try to tamper with a package by adding malware or other unwanted code, or by pretending to be the author of the package.\n\nBy signing mlconjug3 releases using sigstore, users can verify that the package they are downloading is the one that was created and uploaded by the package's author, Sekou Diao (diao.sekou.nlp@gmail.com), and that it has not been tampered with. This provides an additional layer of security for users and helps to ensure that they can trust the package they are using.\n\nWhat is sigstore?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSigstore is an open-source tool that allows developers to easily sign their software releases, making it easy for users to verify the authenticity of the package. The signature is cryptographically verified against the developer's public key, which is stored on a publicly accessible keyserver. This ensures that the package has not been tampered with and that it was indeed released by the developer who claims to have released it.\n\nHow to verify the signature of a release?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo verify the package, you can use the instructions provided below, which will show you how to check the package's signature and certificate using the python package sigstore, and also check for claims specific to GitHub Actions.\n\n\nTo verify a mlconjug3 release, the sigstore python module can be used. By default, sigstore verify will attempt to find a <filename>.sig and <filename>.crt in the same directory as the file being verified. For example, to verify the file mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz, sigstore verify will look for mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz.sig and mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz.crt.\n\nTo verify the signature, use the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n    \n    $ python -m sigstore verify identity mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz \\\n        --cert-identity 'diao.sekou.nlp@gmail.com' \\\n        --cert-oidc-issuer 'https://github.com/login/oauth'\n\n\nMultiple files can be verified at once:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ python -m sigstore verify identity mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz mlconjug3-3.10.0-py3-none-any.whl \\\n        --cert-identity 'diao.sekou.nlp@gmail.com' \\\n        --cert-oidc-issuer 'https://github.com/login/oauth'\n\nIf the signature and certificate files are at different paths, they can be specified explicitly (but only for one file at a time):\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ python -m sigstore verify identity mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz \\\n        --certificate some/other/path/mlconjug3-3.10.crt \\\n        --signature some/other/path/mlconjug3-3.10.sig \\\n        --cert-identity 'diao.sekou.nlp@gmail.com' \\\n        --cert-oidc-issuer 'https://github.com/login/oauth'\n\nVerifying signatures from GitHub Actions:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ python -m sigstore verify github mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz \\\n        --certificate mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz.crt \\\n        --signature mlconjug3-3.10.tar.gz.sig \\\n        --cert-identity https://github.com/diao.sekou.nlp/mlconjug3/.github/workflows/sign_and_publish.yml@refs/tags/v3.10.0\n\nGitHub Actions specific claims can also be verified by adding flags such as --trigger, --sha, --name, --repository, and --ref.\n\nPlease note that these are examples and the exact file names and paths may vary depending on the version and distribution of mlconjug3 being verified. It is important to ensure that the correct signature and certificate files are being used for verification.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis package was created with the help of Verbiste_ and scikit-learn_.\n\nThe logo was designed by Zuur_.\n\n.. _Verbiste: https://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/verbiste.html\n.. _scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html\n.. _Zuur: https://github.com/zuuritaly\n.. _`PlanVerb: Domain-Independent Verbalization and Summary of Task Plans`: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/21204/version/19491/20953\n.. _`Generative Grading Neural Approximate Parsing for Automated Student Feedback`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09916\n.. _`Fluorescing Questions: Effects of Semantic Perturbations on BERT Performance in SQuAD 1.1`: https://github.com/spencerng/squad-sentiment/blob/87b42a41ba7f4f3f8d4e6c478f746d6cdf9f5515/assets/semantic-perturbations-bert-performance.pdf\n.. _`Extensions and Applications of Deep Probabilistic Inference for Generative Models`: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IXi-RleFoG9L6G70TEKbAGd-v29R2Zz/view?usp=sharing\n.. _`EDS-NLP`: https://github.com/aphp/edsnlp\n.. _`Runebook`: https://github.com/runebookdev/runebook/tree/4391d52588bb5c5c0e7d49a0c31b4bdc1cbffb47\n.. _`Gender Bias Visualization`: https://github.com/GesaJo/Gender-Bias-Visualization\n.. _`Text Adaptation To Context`: https://github.com/lzontar/Text_Adaptation_To_Context\n.. _`Facemask Detection`: https://github.com/samuel-karanja/facemask-derection\n.. _`Bad Excuses for Zoom Abuses`: https://github.com/tyxchen/bad-excuses-for-zoom-abuses\n.. _NLP: https://github.com/pskshyam/NLP\n.. _`Virtual Assistant`: https://github.com/JeanExtreme002/Virtual-Assistant\n.. _`Bad Advice`: https://github.com/matthew-cheney/bad-advice\n.. _`Spanish Conjugations Quiz`: https://github.com/williammortimer/Spanish-Conjugations-Quiz\n.. _`Silver Rogue DF`: https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/silver-rogue-df\n.. _`NLP-Suite`: https://github.com/NLP-Suite/NLP-Suite\n.. _`twitter-bot`: https://github.com/arthurcouyere/twitter-bot\n.. _`verb-form-helper`: https://github.com/gittymutt/verb-form-helper\n.. _`NLP Tasks`: https://github.com/ai-systems/poly-nlp\n.. _`verbecc-svc`: https://pypi.org/project/verbecc/\n.. _`nvhtml`: https://pypi.org/project/nvhtml/\n.. _`Machine Translation Service`: https://github.com/pauchai/machine-translation-service\n.. _`Tux`: https://github.com/amirkasraa/Tux\n.. _`learn-spanish-react`: https://github.com/advay168/learn-spanish-react\n.. _`Learn_vocab`: https://github.com/MilaimKas/Learn_vocab\n",
