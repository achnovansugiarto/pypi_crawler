    "description": "DUNE-library\n============\n\nDUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox\nfor solving partial differential equations with grid-based methods.\n\nThe main intention is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of\nlegacy and/or new libraries. Using C++ techniques DUNE allows one to use very\ndifferent implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) under\na common interface with a very low overhead.\n\nDUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretization\nusing methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also Finite\nDifferences. Through separation of data structures DUNE allows fast Linear\nAlgebra like provided in the ISTL module, or usage of external libraries\nlike blas.\n\nThis package contains the basic DUNE common classes.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\ndune-common depends on the following software packages\n\n- pkg-config\n- Compiler (C, C++): GNU >=7 or Clang >= 5\n\n  Other compilers might work too, they need to support C++17 to the extend the\n  ones above do.\n\nThe following software is recommended but optional:\n\n- MPI (either OpenMPI, lam, or mpich suffice)\n\nFor a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read\nthe [installation notes][installation]. The following introduction is meant for\nthe impatient.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe DUNE-library and headers are licensed under version 2 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License, with the so-called \"runtime exception\", as\nfollows:\n\n> As a special exception, you may use the DUNE source files as part\n> of a software library or application without restriction.\n> Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or use macros or\n> inline functions from one or more of the DUNE source files, or you\n> compile one or more of the DUNE source files and link them with\n> other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause\n> Athe resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public\n> License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other\n> reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General\n> Public License.\n\nThis licence clones the one of the libstc++ library.
