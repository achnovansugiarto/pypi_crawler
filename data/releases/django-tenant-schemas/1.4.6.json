A vital feature for every Software-as-a-Service website.\n\nDjango provides currently no simple way to support multiple tenants using the same project instance, even when only the data is different. Because we don't want you running many copies of your project, you'll be able to have:\n\n* Multiple customers running on the same instance\n* Shared and Tenant-Specific data\n* Tenant View-Routing\n\nWhat are schemas\n----------------\nA schema can be seen as a directory in an operating system, each directory (schema) with it's own set of files (tables and objects). This allows the same table name and objects to be used in different schemas without conflict. For an accurate description on schemas, see [PostgreSQL's official documentation on schemas](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-schemas.html).\n\nWhy schemas\n-----------\nThere are typically three solutions for solving the multinancy problem. \n\n1. Isolated Approach: Separate Databases. Each tenant has it's own database.\n\n2. Semi Isolated Approach: Shared Database, Separate Schemas. One database for all tenants, but one schema per tenant.\n\n3. Shared Approach: Shared Database, Shared Schema. All tenants share the same database and schema. There is a main tenant-table, where all other tables have a foreign key pointing to.\n\nThis application implements the second approach, which in our opinion, represents the ideal compromise between simplicity and performance.\n\n* Simplicity: barely make any changes to your current code to support multitenancy. Plus, you only manage one database.\n* Performance: make use of shared connections, buffers and memory.\n\nEach solution has it's up and down sides, for a more in-depth discussion, see Microsoft's excelent article on [Multi-Tenant Data Architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx).\n\nHow it works\n------------\nTenants are identified via their host name (i.e tenant.domain.com). This information is stored on a table on the `public` schema. Whenever a request is made, the host name is used to match a tenant in the database. If there's a match, the search path is updated to use this tenant's schema. So from now on all queries will take place at the tenant's schema. For example, suppose you have a tenant `customer` at http://customer.example.com. Any request incoming at `customer.example.com` will automatically use `customer`'s schema and make the tenant available at the request. If no tenant is found, a 404 error is raised. This also means you should have a tenant for your main domain, typically using the `public` schema. For more information please read the [setup](https://django-tenant-schemas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) section.\n\nWhat can this app do?\n---------------------------------------\n### As many tenants as you want ###\nEach tenant has its data on a specific schema. Use a single project instance to serve as many as you want.\n\n### Tenant-specific and shared apps ###\nTenant-specific apps do not share their data between tenants, but you can also have shared apps where the information is always available and shared between all.\n\n### Tenant View-Routing ###\nYou can have different views for `http://customer.example.com/` and `http://example.com/`, even though Django only uses the string after the host name to identify which view to serve.\n\n### Magic ###\nEveryone loves magic! You'll be able to have all this barely having to change your code!\n\nSetup & Documentation\n-------------\n**This is just a short setup guide**, it is **strongly** recommended that you read the complete version at [django-tenant-schemas.readthedocs.org](https://django-tenant-schemas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n\nYour `DATABASE_ENGINE` setting needs to be changed to\n\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'tenant_schemas.postgresql_backend',\n            # ..\n        }\n    }\n    \nAdd the middleware `tenant_schemas.middleware.TenantMiddleware` to the top of `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`, so that each request can be set to use the correct schema.\n    \n    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (\n        'tenant_schemas.middleware.TenantMiddleware',\n        #...\n    )\n    \nAdd `tenant_schemas` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n### Create your tenant model ###\n    from django.db import models\n    from tenant_schemas.models import TenantMixin\n    \n    class Client(TenantMixin):\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n        paid_until =  models.DateField()\n        on_trial = models.BooleanField()\n        created_on = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)\n\nDefine on `settings.py` which model is your tenant model. Assuming you created `Client` inside an app named `customers`, your `TENANT_MODEL` should look like this:\n\n    TENANT_MODEL = \"customers.Client\" # app.Model\n    \nNow run `sync_schemas`, this will sync your apps to the `public` schema.\n\n    python manage.py sync_schemas --shared\n    \nCreate your tenants just like a normal django model. Calling `save` will automatically create and sync the schema.\n\n    from customers.models import Client\n\n    # create your public tenant\n    tenant = Client(domain_url='tenant.my-domain.com',\n                    schema_name='tenant1',\n                    name='My First Tenant',\n                    paid_until='2014-12-05',\n                    on_trial=True)\n    tenant.save()\n\nAny request made to `tenant.my-domain.com` will now automatically set your PostgreSQL's `search_path` to `tenant1` and `public`, making shared apps available too. This means that any call to the methods `filter`, `get`, `save`, `delete` or any other function involving a database connection will now be done at the tenant's schema, so you shouldn't need to change anything at your views.\n\nYou're all set, but we have left key details outside of this short tutorial, such as creating the public tenant and configuring shared and tenant specific apps.
