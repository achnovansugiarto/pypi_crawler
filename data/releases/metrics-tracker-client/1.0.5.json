Open a terminal and run\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install metrics-tracker-client\n   ```\n2. Import the package at the entry point of your app and call the `track()` function.\n\n    ```python\n    import metrics_tracker_client\n    metrics_tracker_client.track()\n    ```\n3. Add a copy of the Privacy Notice to the readme file. \n\n   **Note:** All apps that have deployment tracker must include the Privacy Notice.\n\n## Example app\n\nTo see how to include this into your app please visit [Bluemix Hello World](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/python-hello-world-flask). You will want to pay attention to [setup.py](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/python-hello-world-flask/blob/master/setup.py) and [hello.py](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/python-hello-world-flask/blob/master/hello.py).\n\n## Privacy Notice\n\nSample web applications that include this package may be configured to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-collector-service) service on each deployment:\n\n* Python package version\n* Python repository URL\n* Application Name (`application_name`)\n* Application GUID (`application_id`)\n* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)\n* Space ID (`space_id`)\n* Application Version (`application_version`)\n* Application URIs (`application_uris`)\n* Labels of bound services\n* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information\n\nThis data is collected from the `setup.py` and `repository.yaml` file in the sample application and the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.\n\n## Disabling Deployment Tracking\n\nPlease see the README for the sample application that includes this package for instructions on disabling deployment tracking, as the instructions may vary based on the sample application in which this package is included.\n\n## License\n\nSee [License.txt](License.txt) for license information.",
