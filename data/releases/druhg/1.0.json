Now you can manipulate clusters by relabeling.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n             labels = dr.relabel(limit1=1, limit2=len(XX)/2, fix_outliers=1)\n             ari = adjusted_rand_score(iris['target'], labels)\n             print ('iris ari', ari)\n\nIt will relabel the clusters, by restricting their size.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n            from druhg import DRUHG\n            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n            import pandas as pd, numpy as np\n\n            XX = pd.read_csv('chameleon.csv', sep='\\t', header=None)\n            XX = np.array(XX)\n            clusterer = DRUHG(max_ranking=200)\n            clusterer.fit(XX)\n\n            plt.figure(figsize=(30,16))\n            clusterer.minimum_spanning_tree_.plot(node_size=200)\n\nIt will draw mstree with druhg-edges.\n\n.. image:: papers/pics/chameleon.jpg\n    :width: 300px\n    :align: center\n    :height: 200px\n    :alt: chameleon\n\n-----------\nPerformance\n-----------\n| It can be slow on a highly structural data.\n| There is a parameters ``max_ranking`` that can be used decreased for a better performance.\n\n----------\nInstalling\n----------\n\nPyPI install, presuming you have an up to date pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install druhg\n\n\n-----------------\nRunning the Tests\n-----------------\n\nThe package tests can be run after installation using the command:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    nosetests -s druhg\n\nor, if ``nose`` is installed but ``nosetests`` is not in your ``PATH`` variable:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python -m nose -s druhg\n\nThe tests may fail :-D\n\n--------------\nPython Version\n--------------\n\nThe druhg library supports both Python 2 and Python 3. \n\n\n------------\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe welcome contributions in any form!
