    "description": "===================\napi-wrappers-python\n===================\n\nSource available: https://github.com/miiCard/api-wrappers-python\nLicensed under BSD 3-Clause licence (see LICENSE.txt)\n\nPython wrapper classes around the miiCard API.\n\nThis repository houses the source for the latest version of the miiCard \nConsumers library available on PyPI. \n\nSee http://www.miicard.com/developers for more information.\n\n\nWhat is miiCard\n===============\n\nmiiCard lets anybody prove their identity to the same level of traceability as \nusing a passport, driver's licence or photo ID. We then allow external web \napplications to ask miiCard users to share a portion of their identity \ninformation with the application through a web-accessible API.\n\n\nWhat is the library for?\n========================\n\nmiiCard's API is an OAuth-protected web service supporting SOAP, POX and JSON -\ndocumentation is available. The library wraps the JSON endpoint of the API, \nmaking it easier to make the required OAuth signed requests.\n\nYou can obtain a consumer key and secret from miiCard by contacting us on our \nsupport form, including the details listed on the developer site.\n\nPull the library into your own application by downloading the latest released \nversion from PyPI.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nYou'll need to implement your own OAuth exchange with miiCard.com's OAuth \nendpoint to obtain an access token and secret for a user. Once you've got your \nconsumer key and secret, access token and access token secret you can \ninstantiate an API wrapper:\n\n\tapi = MiiCardOAuthClaimsService(\"consumer_key\", \"consumer_secret\", \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"access_token\", \"access_token_secret\")\n\nThen make calls against it simply:\n\n\tuser_profile_response = api.get_claims().data\n\n\tuser_first_name = user_profile_response.data.first_name\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nThe library takes a dependency on simplegeo-oauth2, but uses a patched version \nof it to correct a few issues.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\n* Use GitHub issue tracking to report bugs in the library\n* If you're going to submit a patch, please base it off the development branch \n  - the master reflects the latest version published to PyPI but may not \n  necessarily be bleeding-edge\n* Join the miiCard.com developer forums to keep up to date with the latest \n  releases and planned changes",
