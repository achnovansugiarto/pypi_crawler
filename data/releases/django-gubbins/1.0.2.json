    "description": "django-gubbins is a collection of useful snippets for enhancing\nor replacing functionality within Django. For more documentation, see the github\npage at https://github.com/carlio/django-gubbins\n\nAutomatic downcasting to model subclasses :\nThis is for the case when you have a model hierarchy, with several models inheriting from\na base class, and you want to query the base class but get instances of the subclasses\nout of the query set.\n\n`EnumField` : provides an easy way to have a model field which only accepts \nsome values, and at the same time makes it easy to reference those values in your code.\n\n`JSONField` : allows you to store JSON strings in a database. \n\n`ReusableAppURLs` : a simple way to create the correct URL configuration for a reusable\ndjango app.\n\n`SlowFileUploadHandler` : can be used to really slow down handling of file uploads. \nThis is an implementation of the Django file upload handler which will sleep between \nprocessing chunks in order to simulate a slow upload. This is intended for development \nwhen creating features such as an AJAXy file upload progress bar, as uploading to a \nlocal process is often too quick.",
