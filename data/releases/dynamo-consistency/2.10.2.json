    "description": ".. _intro-ref:\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n|build-status|\n\nDynamo Consistency is the consistency plugin for Dynamo Dynamic Data Management System.\nEven though Dynamo controls and tracks the history of file transfers between computing sites,\na separate check is needed to ensure files are not lost or accumulated during user or system errors.\nSites that can no longer access files after a power outage, for example,\ncan cause other problems for the entire data management system.\nTransfers requested from the site to another site will fail for missing files.\nSites are chosen incorrectly for production jobs that assume the presence of a local file.\nLast disk copies may also be missing, causing a delay for user requests for data.\nAnother type of inconsistency is caused when files thought to be deleted are still on disk.\nThis leads to wasted disk space for files that are not accessed, except by accident.\nDynamo Consistency does its check by regularly listing each remote site and\ncomparing the listed contents to Dynamo's inventory database.\n\nThe package also includes a number of modules that can be imported independently\nto create custom consistency check runs.\nA simple consistency check on a site can be done by doing the following\nwhen an instance of ``dynamo`` is installed::\n\n  from dynamo_consistency import config, datatypes, remotelister, inventorylister\n\n  config.LOCATION = '/path/to/config.json'\n  site = 'T2_US_MIT'                        # For example\n\n  inventory_listing = inventorylister.listing(site)\n  remote_listing = remotelister.listing(site)\n\n  datatypes.compare(inventory_listing, remote_listing, 'results')\n\nIn this example,\nthe list of file LFNs in the inventory and not at the site will be in ``results_missing.txt``.\nThe list of file LFNs at the site and not in the inventory will be in ``results_orphan.txt``.\nThe ``listing`` functions can be re-implemented to perform the check desired.\n\nInstallation\n++++++++++++\n\nDynamo Consistency requires the `XRootD <http://xrootd.org/doc/python/xrootd-python-0.1.0/>`_ Python module to be installed separately.\nIn addition, it uses the Dynamo Dynamic Data Management package to get inventory listings\nand to report results of the consistency check.\nAny other needed packages are installed with Dynamo Consistency during installation.\n\nThe simplest way to install is through pip::\n\n  pip install dynamo-consistency\n\nThe source code is maintained on `GitHub <https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency>`_.\nOther typical ``setuptools`` methods are supported by the repository's ``setup.py``.\n\n.. |build-status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency",
