    "description": "Dynamo Consistency\n==================\n\n|build-status|\n\nDynamo Consistency is the consistency plugin for Dynamo Dynamic Data Management System.\nIt provides some standalone executables to run the check as well as\nmanipulate the sites' running and reporting statuses.\n\nThe package also includes a number of modules that can be imported independently\nto create custom consistency checks.\nA simple consistency check on a site can be done by doing the following\nwhen an instance of ``dynamo`` is installed::\n\n  from dynamo_consistency import config, datatypes, remotelister, inventorylister\n\n  config.LOCATION = '/path/to/config.json'\n  site = 'T2_US_MIT'     # For example\n\n  inventory_listing = inventorylister.listing(site)\n  remote_listing = remotelister.listing(site)\n\n  datatypes.compare(inventory_listing, remote_listing, 'results')\n\nIn this example,\nthe list of file LFNs in the inventory and not at the site will be in ``results_missing.txt``.\nThe list of file LFNs at the site and not in the inventory will be in ``results_orphan.txt``.\nThe ``listing`` functions can be reimplemented to preform the check desired.\n\nInstallation\n++++++++++++\n\nDynamo Consistency requires modules ``htcondor`` and ``XRootD`` to be installed separately.\nIn addition, it uses the Dynamo Dynamic Data Management package to get inventory listings\nand to report results of the consistency check.\nAny other needed packages are installed with Dynamo Consistency during installation.\n\nThe simplest way to install is through pip::\n\n  pip install dynamo-consistency\n\nThe source code is maintained on `GitHub <https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency>`_.\nOther typical ``setuptools`` methods are supported by the repository's ``setup.py``.\n\n.. |build-status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency",
