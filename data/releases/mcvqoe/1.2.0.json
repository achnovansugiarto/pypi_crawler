    "description": "# Summary\nThe purpose of this software is to make quality of expirence (QoE) measurements \nfor push-to-talk (PTT) communications systems. This Python package develoved by NISTâ€™s PSCR division contains a \nGUI for making these measurements. This GUI is the recommended way to run the \nfollowing QoE measurements:\n\n* [mouth 2 ear latency](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8206.pdf)\n* [Access Time](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8275.pdf)\n* Probability of Successful Delivery\n* [Intelligibility](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/publications/download/Voran-ICASSP17.pdf)\n* [Transmit Volume Optomization](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2171)\n\n\n\n# MCV-QoE-GUI Python Package\n\nThe `mcvqoe` GUI package depends on the following other PSCR published packages:\n\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/abcmrt16>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mouth2ear>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/psud>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/intelligibility>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QOE-TVO>\n\nIn addition the following dependencies can be found in the Python Package index (PyPI) and will \nbe downloaded automatically, if needed, when `mcvqoe` is installed:\n\n* numpy\n* pandas\n* dash\n* flask\n* plotly\n* requests\n* pillow\n\nTo install the package run the following:\n```\npip install mcvqoe\n```\nThis is the easiest way to install all MCV QoE measurement software, as all the above packages are dependencies, and will be installed via PyPI.\n\nAlternatively, one could clone this repository and run the following from the \nroot of the git repository:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n## Running with terminal output\n\nOn windows, the GUI entry point, `mcvqoe` causes all console output from the GUI \nto be lost (on windows). If the input is desired on windows the GUI can also be \nrun with the following:\n\n```\npython -m mcvqoe.hub\n```\n\n## Evaluation GUI\n\nData can be evaluated by using the Process Data menu from the GUI. Here users can select data they wish to process and a separate, browser-based interface will initialize.\n\n\n# License\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
