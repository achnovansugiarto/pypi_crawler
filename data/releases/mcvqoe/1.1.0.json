    "description": "# Summary\nThe purpose of this software is to make quality of expirence (QoE) measurements \nfor push-to-talk (PTT) communications systems. This Python package develoved by NISTâ€™s PSCR division contains a \nGUI for making these measurements. This GUI is the recommended way to run the \nfollowing QoE measurements:\n\n* [mouth 2 ear latency](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8206.pdf)\n* [Access Time](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8275.pdf)\n* Probability of Successful Delivery\n* [Intelligibility](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/publications/download/Voran-ICASSP17.pdf)\n* [Transmit Volume Optomization](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2171)\n\n\n\n# MCV-QoE-GUI Python Package\n\nThe `mcvqoe` GUI package depends on the following other PSCR published packages:\n\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/abcmrt16>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mouth2ear>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/psud>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/intelligibility>\n* <https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QOE-TVO>\n\nThey must be installed before the `mcvqoe` package is installed. In addition the \nfollowing dependencies can be found in the Python Package index (PyPi) and will \nbe downloaded automatically, if needed, when `mcvqoe` is installed:\n\n* numpy\n* pandas\n* dash\n* flask\n* plotly\n* requests\n* pillow\n\nTo install the package, clone this repository and run the following from the \nroot of the git repository:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n## Running with terminal output\n\nOn windows, the GUI entry point, `mcvqoe` causes all console output from the GUI \nto be lost (on windows). If the input is desired on windows the GUI can also be \nrun with the following:\n\n```\npython -m mcvqoe.hub\n```\n\n## Evaluation GUI\n\nData can be evaluated by using the Process Data menu from the GUI. Here users can select data they wish to process and a separate, browser-based interface will initialize.\n\n\n# License\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
