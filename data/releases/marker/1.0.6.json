Currently, the following platforms are supported:\n\n- Canvas\n- MarkUs\n\n\nThis package installs the program `marker`. It supports the following commands:\n\n- `marker download`: Downloads files from the given LMS.\n- `marker prepare`: Copies needed files into student directories, compiles code.\n- `marker run`: Runs all the test cases, creates logs and compiles marks.\n- `marker upload-marks`: Uploads the student marks to the LMS.\n- `marker upload-reports`: Uploads the testing logs to the LMS for the student.\n- `marker set-status`: Sets the marking state of the submission (MarkUs only).\n\n---\n\n## How to install\n\nThere are 2 ways to install this marker. The recommended way of doing this is to install from `pip`:\n\n### - Using PIP\n\n```\npip install automark\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to develop, you will need to build from source:\n\n### - Build from source\n\nFirst, clone this repository to your machine:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/mustafaquraish/marker\n```\n\nThen, go into the cloned repo and use the Makefile to build and install\n```sh\ncd marker\nmake install\n```\n\nAlternatively, use the following commands to build and install yourself if your preferred `python` and `pip` executables are named differently:\n\n```\npython3 setup.py bdist_wheel\npip3 install dist/*     \n```\n\n---\n\n[Full Documentation available in the wiki](https://github.com/mustafaquraish/marker/wiki)\n\n\n\n",
