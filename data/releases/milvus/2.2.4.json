    "description": "# Embeded Milvus\n\n[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/milvus.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/milvus)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe embedded Milvus is a lightweight version of Milvus that can be embedded into your Python application. It is a single binary that can be easily installed and run on your machine.\n\nIt could be imported as a Python library, as well as use it as a command standalone server.\n\nThanks to Milvus standalone version could be run with embeded etcd and local storage, embedded milvus does not have any other dependencies.\n\nEverything you do with embedded Milvus, every piece of code you write for embedded Milvus can be safely migrated to other forms of Milvus (standalone version, cluster version, cloud version, etc.).\n\nPlease note that it is not suggested to use embedded Milvus in a production environment. Consider using Milvus clustered or the fully managed Milvus on Cloud. \n\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nHere's a list of verified OS types where Embedded Milvus can successfully build and run:\n- Ubuntu >= 18.04 (x86_64)\n- CentOS >= 7.0 (x86_64)\n- MacOS >= 11.0 (Apple Silicon)\n\nFor linux we use manylinux2014 as the base image, so it should be able to run on most linux distributions.\n\n## Installation\n\nEmbedded Milvus is available on PyPI. You can install it via `pip` for Python 3.6+:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 -m pip install milvus\n```\n\nOr, install with client(pymilvus):\n```bash\n$ python3 -m pip install \"milvus[client]\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Import as Python library\nYou could load the `default_server` in Python and start it.\n\n```python\nfrom milvus import default_server\nfrom pymilvus import connections\n\n# Optional, if you want store all related data to specific location\n# default it wil using:\n#   %APPDATA%/milvus-io/milvus-server on windows\n#   ~/.milvus-io/milvus-server on linux\ndefault_server.set_base_dir('milvus_data')\n\n# Optional, if you want cleanup previous data\ndefault_server.cleanup()\n\n# star you milvus server\ndefault_server.start()\n\n# Now you could connect with localhost and the port\n# The port is in default_server.listen_port\nconnections.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=default_server.listen_port)\n```\n\n### CLI milvus-server\n\nYou could also use the `milvus-server` command to start the server.\n\n```bash\n$ milvus-serevr\n```\n\nThe full options cloud be found by `milvus-server --help`.\n\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Debug startup\n\nYou could use `debug_server` instead of `default_server` for checking startup failures.\n\n```python\nfrom milvus import debug_server\n```\n\nand you could also try create server instance by your self\n\n```python\nfrom milvus import MilvusServer\n\nserver = MilvusServer(debug=True)\n```\n\nIf you're using CLI `milvus-server`, you could use `--debug` to enable debug mode.\n\n```bash\n$ milvus-server --debug\n```\n\n### Context\n\nYou could close server while you not need it anymore.\nOr, you're able to using `with` context to start/stop it.\n\n```python\nfrom milvus import default_server\n\nwith default_server:\n    # milvus started, using default server here\n    ...\n```\n\n### Data and Log Persistence\n\nBy default all data and logs are stored in the following locations: `~/.milvus.io/milvus-server/VERSION` (VERSION is the versiong string of embedded Milvus).\n\nYou could also set it at runtime(before the server started), by Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom milvus import default_server\ndefault_server.set_base_dir('milvus_data')\n```\n\nOr with CLI:\n\n```bash\n$ milvus-server --data milvus_data\n```\n\n### Working with PyMilvus\n\nEmbedded Milvus could be run without pymilvus if you just want run as a server.\nYou could also install with extras `client` to get pymilvus.\n\n```bash\n$ python3 -m pip install \"milvus[client]\"\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nEmbedded Milvus is friendly with jupyter notebook, you could find more examples under [examples](https://github.com/milvus-io/embd-milvus/blob/main/examples) folder.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you want to contribute to Embedded Milvus, please read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/milvus-io/embd-milvus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\n\n## License\nEmbedded Milvus is under the Apache 2.0 license.
