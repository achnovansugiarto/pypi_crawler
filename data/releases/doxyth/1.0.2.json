    "description": "# DoxyTH\nDoxyTH stands for Doxygen inline-documentation Translation Helper. This small package aims to provide a \nquick way to generate Doxygen docs in HTML (LaTeX will come later) in different languages easily.\n\n## Setup\n### Installation\nYou first have to install the package.\nYou can install it automatically via pip\n```commandline\npip install doxyth\n```\n\nYou can also install it by cloning the Github repository (deprecated)\n\n### Setting up the translations folder\nIn your project directory, create a directory that will contain all the translations.\nYou can name it however you want, even though a meaningful name like `translations` is still better.\n\nInside, you have to create a directory with the [ISO 639-1 2-letters code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) \nfor the desired language. Directories having more or less than 2 charaters will be ignored by DoxyTH, but unrecognised\n2-characters directories will generate warnings.\n\nThis is an example layout (and the one I use for the DoxyTH package documentation!)\n```ignorelang\n<path>\\DOXYTH\\TRANSLATIONS\n|--- en/\n|       doxyth.dthdoc\n|       gendoc.dthdoc\n|\n|--- fr/\n        gendoc.dthdoc\n```\n(I simplified the tree for more readability)\n\nIn each language directory, you will need to create one (or more) `.dthdoc` files. All files having\nanother extension will be ignored.\n\n### Layout of a .dthdoc file\nEach file follows the current format:\n```ignorelang\n&doc_id <ID>\n\"\"\"\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n`ID` is the ID you will put in your code, and `DOCUMENTATION` (everything between the two `\"\"\"`) is what will replace\nthe doclines where this ID is found.\n\n**WARNING**: Be aware that the line breaks are important. The `\"\"\"` must be ALONE on their line.\n\nDoxyTH will remove any empty lines between the start of the doclines and the start of your comment \n(same as between the end of your comment and the end of the doclines) to avoid problems when passing the file lines to a \npostprocess.\n\n### In-code documentation\nIn your code, you can then start to write the `doc_id`s.\nIf you wish to replace doclines by a translations, put a `doc_id` following this layout:\n```python\n\"\"\"\n### &doc_id <PREFIX>:<ID>\n\"\"\"\n```\n(For advanced users, the regex pattern is `r\"\\s*###\\s*&doc_id\\s*\"`)\n\n**WARNING**: Don't forget the prefix! The prefix is the name of the documentation file\nthe `doc_id` was found in.\n\nExample: If you have a file named `mydocs.dthdoc` which contains a `my_doc_id` ID inside,\nThe full `doc_id` you need to include in your code is `mydocs:my_doc_id`.\n\nSee below under Usage how to deactivate file prefixes, if you wish to do so.\n\n## Running the program\n### Usage\nThis is the usage provided by argparse itself:\n```ignorelang\nusage: __main__.py [-h] [--verify] [-V] [--noverbose] [-F] [-D DOXYFILE]\n                   [-P POSTPROCESS] [--listpostprocesses] [--debug | --mute]\n                   [--nocleanup] [--skipgen]\n                   translation_dir\n```\n\n#### Positional arguments\n- `translation_dir`: The translations folder explained above.\n\n#### Optional arguments\n- `-h`: prints this usage message\n- `--verify`: verifies the layout of the translations folder and all files inside, instead of actually generating the \ndocumentation\n- `-V` (or `--version`): prints the version then exits.\n- `--noverbose`: no output will be printed in the console.\n- `-F` (or `--nofileprefix`): Deactivates the file prefixes when registering `doc_id`s.\n- `-D` (or `--doxyfile`): Path to a custom Doxyfile. If this option is not provided, DoxyTH will look for a file \nnamed `Doxyfile` by default. Passing this option is necessary only when your Doxygen configuration file is \nNOT named `Doxyfile`\n- `-P` (or `--postprocess`): Passes the file lines to a postprocess instead of printing them back to Doxygen.\n- `--listpostprocesses`: Lists all the available postprocesses, then exits.\n- [`--debug` | `--mute`]: `debug` prints everything, including non-error from the Doxygen output, whereas `mute` totally\nmutes Doxygen, including the warnings and errors (and also those of DoxyTH itself). Both are NOT recommended unless\nyou perfectly know what you are doing.\n- `--nocleanup`: Leaves the temporary files upon finishing generating the documentation. You shouldn't be using this\noption unless you know why you use it.\n- `--skipgen`: Debug option. Skips the Doxygen docs generation. DO NOT use unless you know how to.\n\n\n### Generating documentation\n\nIf you want to generate the documentation from the different translations files, simply run the gendoc package\n\n```commandline\npython -m doxyth.gendoc\n```\nor\n```commandline\npython -m doxyth\n```\n\nusing the usage above.\n\n### Verifying the translations\n\nIf you wish to verify the translations files/directories, you can do so by running the verify package\n\n```commandline\npython -m doxyth.verify\n```\n\nIts usage is as follows:\n```ignorelang\nusage: verify.py [-h]\n                 {directory,dir,d,languagedirectory,langdir,ld,file,f} documentation\n\npositional arguments:\n  {directory,dir,d,languagedirectory,langdir,ld,file,f}\n                        Sub-modules\n    directory (dir, d)  Verify the documentation format of the whole\n                        translations directory\n    languagedirectory   Verify the documentation format of a language\n        (langdir, ld)   directory\n    file (f)            Verify the documentation format of a file\n\n  documentation         The path of either the directory or the file\n```\n\nIf you choose to verify the whole directory, it will ouput the number of translations per language and print a warning\nif the number of translations of at least one language is different from the others.\n\nIf you choose to verify either a language directory or a file, it will print the number of doc_ids found in this file,\nor any errors if some are found.\n\n",
