    "description": "# NightyNight and WakeyWakey!\n\nDo you have a EC2 instance or an RDS instance that you only need during certain hours of the day? Do you want to reduce it's cost? How about just stopping it every night?\n\nThat's the NightyNight construct. It's very simple. Give it an `instanceId` and it will create a Lambda and a CloudWatch Event Rule to fire the lambda at a specific time of day. If the instance is running, it's stopped.\n\nThere are currently two variations of the construct:\n\n* [NightyNightForEc2](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-nightynightforec2) - stops an EC2 instance at a given time.\n* [NightyNightForRds](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-nightynightforrds) - stops an RDS instance at a given time.\n* [NightyNightForAsg](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-nightynightforasg) - sets the desired capacity for an ASG at a given time.\n* [NightyNightForEcs](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-nightynightforecs) - sets the desired capacity for an ECS service at a given time.\n\n# WakeyWakey\n\nThe WakeyWakey construct (from [this](https://github.com/mbonig/wakeywakey) repository) has been integrated into this library. You don't need to install\na separate dependency anymore.\n\n* [WakeyWakeyForEc2](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-wakeywakeyforec2) - start an EC2 instance at a given time.\n* [WakeyWakeyForRds](./API.md#matthewbonig-nightynight-wakeywakeyforrds) - start an RDS instance at a given time.\n\nThere isn't a specific construct for starting ASGs or ECS services, since you can just set the count to whatever you want.\n\n# This is a pre-release!\n\nThis is a quick first-draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accommodate a large\nnumber of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this construct, please\nopen an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/nightynight/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).\n\nThere are multiple versions of this library published. You should be using the v0.X.X versions for now.\nThere are versions published that match the CDK version they depend on, but don't use those.\n\n# What it creates\n\n![arch.png](./arch.png)\n\n* A Rule that will, on a given schedule, fire a lambda.\n* A Lambda with permissions to describe ec2 instances. It will read the instance by the given `instanceId` and then stop the instance if it's in a running state.\n\n# Example:\n\n```python\nimport {NightyNightForEc2, WakeyWakeyForEc2} from \"./ec2\";\n\nexport class NightyNightStack extends Stack {\n\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    // The code that defines your stack goes here\n    new NightyNightForEc2(this, 'nighty-night', {instanceId: 'i-123123123123'});\n    new WakeyWakeyForEc2(this, 'wakey-wakey', {instanceId: 'i-123123123123'})\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will stop the instance with id `i-123123123123` at (the default) 4am UTC. It will then start the instance at 12am UTC.\n\n# API Doc\n\nSee the [API Docs](./API.md) for more info.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease open Pull Requests and Issues on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/mbonig/nightynight).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n\n",
