    "description": "Madrona\n========\n\nA software framework for effective place-based decision making\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nMadrona offers a flexible set of building blocks and design patterns that allow you to create cutting-edge tools for decision support and spatial planning at any scale.\n\nMadrona leverages open source technology including Django, PostGIS, Mapnik, GDAL, and JQuery.  It provides robust support for 2D and 3D mapping using the GeoJSON and KML data standards allowing you to use mapping clients such as OpenLayers and Google Earth.  The architecture is modular allowing you to integrate almost any third party library both proprietary and open-source.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nVisit http://madrona.ecotrust.org for case studies, a technology overview, and much more.
