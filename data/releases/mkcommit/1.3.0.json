Aren't editors enough?\n\nWhen working in teams it's hard to enforce proper Git commit message style from everyone. This CLI tool asks you questions to build a commit message that you can configure for yourself and your team with a very simple Python script.\n\n### `commitlint` exists. Why `mkcommit`?\n\n`commitlint` is a great tool. But it has considerable learning curve if you want to leverage its full potential. This tool strives to be the exact opposite: provide bare minimum with almost no overhead for your teammates. All they will need to learn is this one command: `mkcommit`.\n\n`mkcommit` is:\n\n- Easy to install - all you need is Python (at least version 3.6).\n- Easy to configure - all you need is basic Python skills or advanced copy-pasting skills.\n- Easy to use - all you need is one command to trigger the commit prompt.\n- Scalable - it can be as complex as you want it, with full Git Hook integration and complex validation rules or just with a plain default Semantic Commit generation out-of-the-box.\n- Pythonic - might suit you better if you're familiar with Python and don't want to venture into the world of JavaScript.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you have Python set up, you're good to go. Run `pip install mkcommit` and you're done.\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. At the root of your repository create a Python file named `my_repo.mkcommit.py`.\n2. Compose the script:\n\n    - A built-in _conventional commit_ suite can be used:\n\n        ```python\n        from mkcommit import CommitMessage, to_stdout\n        from mkcommit.suites import conventional\n\n        def commit():\n            return CommitMessage(*conventional.default())\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            to_stdout(commit())\n        ```\n\n    - If you need to define your own keywords and commit message template, read [Configuration](https://github.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/wiki/Configuration) in our Wiki.\n\n        - If you want to learn how to use the hook mode, read [Hooks](https://github.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/wiki/Hooks) in our Wiki.\n\n    - When you have implemented the file in one repo and want to use the **exact same** file in another repo, you should use `include` e.g.\n\n        ```python\n        from mkcommit import to_stdout, include\n\n        commit, on_commit = include(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/master/test/res/example.semantic.mkcommit.py\")\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            to_stdout(commit())\n        ```\n\n3. Run `mkcommit`. Select the discovered configuration file for the list and follow the interactive prompt.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Run `mkcommit` to generate a Git commit message and commit changes (calls `git commit -m` underneath).\n- Run `mkcommit -s` to generate a Git commit message and print it to standard output.\n- Run `mkcommit -c` to generate a Git commmit message and copy it to your clipboard.\n- Use `mkcommit -x \"some commit message\"` to validate an existing commit message from the command line or as a Git Hook command (requires `on_commit(msg)` function to be implemented in the configuration file).\n\nIf you wish to point `mkcommit` to a specific configuration file, use `mkcommit -f /path/to/.mkcommit.py`. You can combine the `-f` flag with all the other available flags.\n\n### Input validation\n\nThe most basic validation strategy we use is [validation at the time of message generation](https://github.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/wiki/Validators).\n\nFor validation of commit messages that aren't originally generated with `mkcommit` you can use [Hooks](https://github.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/wiki/Hooks).\n\n### Built-in suites\n\nA list of suites that are supported out-of-the-box can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/kjczarne/mkcommit/wiki/Suites).\n\n\n",
