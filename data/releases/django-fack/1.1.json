    "description": "===========\nDjango-Fack\n===========\n\nThis is a simple FAQ application for a Django powered site, featuring:\n\n* The basic Q&A model you'd expect.\n\n* Question are grouped into topics.\n\n* Topics can be ordered and arranged, as can questions within topics.\n\n* Built-in views to drill down by topic and question, and individual\n  question detail pages (for permalinks).\n\n* A view for users to submit new questions (with or without answers). These\n  go into moderation queue and need to be marked \"active\" before they'll\n  show up on the site.\n\nThere's an example app (distributed with the source) to try out if you'd like\nto get a taste of the app.\n\nFor more details, `see the documentation`__\n\n__ http://django-fack.rtfd.org/\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nDjango 1.3+, Python 2.6+.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n1. ``pip install django-fack``\n\n2. Add ``\"fack\"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.\n\n3. Wire up the FAQ views by adding a line to your URLconf::\n\n        url('^faq/', include('fack.urls'))\n\n\nIf you'd like to load some example data then run ``python manage.py loaddata\nfaq_test_data.json``\n\nThe app's written with quite a bit of customization in mind; `see the customization documentation`__ for details.\n\n__ http://django-fack.rtfd.org/en/latest/customization.html\n\nExample Site\n============\n\nThere is a stand-alone example site distributed with the source in the\n`example/` directory. To try it out:\n\n1. Install django-Fack (see above).\n\n1. Run ``python manage.py syncdb``\n\n   This assumes that sqlite3 is available; if not you'll need to change the\n   ``DATABASES`` setting first.\n\n3. Load some example data by running\n   ``python manage.py loaddata faq_test_data.json``\n\n4. Run ``python manage.py runserver`` and you will have the example site up and\n   running. The home page will have links to get to the available views as well\n   as to the admin.\n\nThe capability to submit an FAQ is available and works whether or not you are a\nlogged in user. Note that a staff member will have to use the admin and review\nany submitted FAQs and clean them up and set them to active before they are\nviewable by the end user views.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nTo run the tests, install tox__ (``pip install tox``) then run ``tox``.\n\n__ http://codespeak.net/tox/\n\nDevelopment `takes place on GitHub`__. Bug reports, pataches, and pull requests\nare always welcome!\n\n__ https://github.com/revsys/django-fack",
