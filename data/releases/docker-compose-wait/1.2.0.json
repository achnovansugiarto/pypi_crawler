    "description": "# docker-compose-wait\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/docker-compose-wait.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose-wait/)\n\n\nSome useful script to wait until all services declared in a docker-compose file are up and running.\n\nThis script uses the health check mechanism provided since Docker 1.12. If your services have a configured health check, after making a `docker-compose up -d` you can simply call this script to have it wait until all your services health statuses are fixed. If they are all `healthy` it will return `0` if any of them is `unhealthy` (or `Down`) it will return -1.\n\nThis script can be useful, as example, in Continuous Integration or other situations when you just want to wait until a stack is deployed before performing other actions.\n\n*Please note this script does not do anything about dependencies startup order. See the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/) for that problem.*\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install docker-compose-wait\n```\n\nThis utility requires Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.3. It also supports `docker-compose` from version 1.10.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nusage: docker-compose-wait.py [options]\n\nWait until all services in a docker-compose file are healthy. Options are\nforwarded to docker-compose.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -f FILE, --file FILE  Specify an alternate compose file (default: docker-\n                        compose.yml)\n  -p PROJECT_NAME, --project-name PROJECT_NAME\n                        Specify an alternate project name (default: directory\n                        name)\n  -w, --wait            Wait for all the processes to stabilize before exit\n                        (default behavior is to exit as soon as any of the\n                        processes is unhealthy)\n  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT\n                        Max amount of time during which this command will run\n                        (expressed using the same format than in docker-\n                        compose.yml files, example: 5s, 10m,... ). If there is\n                        a timeout this command will exit returning 1.\n                        (default: wait for an infinite amount of time)\n```\n\nBasically it can be as simple as:\n\n```\ndocker-compose-wait\n```\n\n`docker-compose-wait` behaves like a `docker-compose` sub-command. It will forward the usual `docker-compose` command-line arguments. The above command will work fine if you previously ran `docker-compose up -d` by referencing the standard `docker-compose.yml` file. If you are using other files for your `docker-compose` configuration just use:\n\n```\ndocker-compose-wait -f <path_to_yaml_file> -f <path_to_other_yaml_file> ...\n```\n\n## License\n\n[See the license file](https://github.com/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n## Contribution\n\n[See the contribution guide](https://github.com/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).",
