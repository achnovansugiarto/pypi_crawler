    "description": "# docker-compose-wait\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait) \n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/docker-compose-wait.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-compose-wait)\n\n\nSome useful script to wait until all services declared in a docker-compose file are up and running.\n\nThis script uses the health check mechanism provided since Docker 1.12. If your services have a configured health check, after making a `docker-compose up -d` you can simply call this script to have it wait until all your services health statuses are fixed. If they are all `healthy` it will return `0` if any of them is `unhealthy` (or `Down`) it will return -1.\n\nThis script can be useful, as example, in Continuous Integration or other situations when you just want to wait until a stack is deployed before performing other actions.\n\n*Please note this script does not do anything about dependencies startup order. See the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/) for that problem.*\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install docker-compose-wait\n```\n\nThis utility requires Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.3.\n\n## Usage\n\nIt can be as simple as:\n\n```\ndocker-compose-wait\n```\n\n`docker-compose-wait` behaves like a `docker-compose` sub-command. It will just forward any option to `docker-compose`. The above command will work fine if you previously ran `docker-compose up -d` by referencing the standard `docker-compose.yml` file. If you are using other files for your `docker-compose` configuration just use:\n\n```\ndocker-compose-wait -f <path_to_yaml_file> -f <path_to_other_yaml_file> ...\n```\n\n## License\n\n[See the license file](https://github.com/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n## Contribution\n\n[See the contribution guide](https://github.com/nicolas-van/docker-compose-wait/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).",
