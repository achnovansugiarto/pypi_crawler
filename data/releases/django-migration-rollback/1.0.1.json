    "description": "# Django Migration Rollback\nA Django package used to just make the `python manage.py migrate` a little easier for Django apps that commit their migrations and want a way to rollback to a previous migration without needing to check what the which one it is via `python manage.py showmigrations` or in the project's git repository.\n\n## Features\nAble to set which branch in a git repository to rollback to using the custom command `migraterollback` or if you wish to just rollback to a previous migration only via `migrateprevious`. Note in order to use the rollback with a git repository's branch feature with git the project must have a `.git` file present.\n\n### Django `migraterollback` command\n    ❯ python manage.py migraterollback polls feature/really-cool-branch\n    Attempting to go back to rollback polls to latest migration on branch feature/really-cool-branch\n    Operations to perform:\n        Target specific migration: 0006_question5, from polls\n    Running migrations:\n        Rendering model states...\n    DONE\n        Unapplying polls.0007_question6...\n    OK\n\nThis command is used to migrate a Django app back to the migration found in a repository's branch (this will also migrate to that migration if behind).\n\n* An app must be specified as the first argument after the command to indicate which app you wish to rollback.\n* By default if no argument is specified after the app, the branch `main` will be used.\n\n### Django `migrateprevious` command\n    ❯ python manage.py migrateprevious polls\n    Attempting to go back to rollback polls to previous migration\n    Operations to perform:\n        Target specific migration: 0005_question4, from polls\n    Running migrations:\n        Rendering model states...\n    DONE\n        Unapplying polls.0006_question5...\n    OK\n\nThis command is used to migrate a Django app back to the previously applied migration.\n\n* An app must be specified as the first argument after the command to indicate which app you wish to migrate to the previously applied migration.\n\n## Installing\n### From PyPi\n```\npip install django-migration-rollback\n```\n\n### From GitHub\n```\npip install git+ssh://git@github.com/jdboisvert/django-migration-rollback\n```\n\n### Quick start\nAdd \"migration_rollback\" to your INSTALLED_APPS in the `settings.py` like this:\n```\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'migration_rollback',\n    ]\n```\n",
