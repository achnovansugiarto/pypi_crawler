Why\\'s it asking for a URL?\n\nThis library is designed to download timetable data held in JSON format\nand accessible via a URL. It\\'s up to the user of the library to provide\nthat URL. There is at least one such URL in the public domain, but that\naddress isn\\'t provided here.\n\nAnd yes, this technically means that anyone can craft an online dataset\nof custom times and have it accessible with this library. If you do,\nI\\'d love to hear about it.\n\n### How do you use the CLI tool?\n\nThe tool uses the click library, so passing --help everywhere should give some\nguidance on usage. Hint: you have to init first.\n\nHonestly, I don't expect many to use this and so documentation is a little... \nlacking. As with all great programmers, I believe the tool to make sense out \nof the box. You can drop me a line if you get stuck - eventually that\nwill form the documentation.\n\n### Why not just use on of the many Prayer Time libraries available on Pypi?\n\nIn short, because they won\\'t output London Unified Prayer Times.\n\nMost prayer time libraries (Python or otherwise), either directly use\nthe amazing work of Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh presented at\n<http://praytimes.org/calculation> or indirectly by wrapping\n<https://aladhan.com/>. On the other hand, ELM produces a curated\ntimetable for the whole of the London region, that, unfortunately, can\nnot be calculated (for more info, see:\n<https://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/prayer-times-and-calendar-explained>).\n\nWhile arguably more correct (since they use your precise location as an\ninput), the libraries relying on calculation will not match up with the\nELM dataset. The ELM timetable is shared by The London Central Mosque,\nand so has the mindshare of many mosques across London. So if you want\nyour application to likely  match the timetable of your local London mosque,\nthis this library may be for you.\n\nMost of the existing Pypi libraries also choose to wrap\n<https://aladhan.com/>, which means they require an online connection to\noperate (which although convenient seems a bit convoluted for a\ncalculation that could easily be performed locally). The aim of this\nlibrary is to be able to operate offline as much as possible, by\nmaintaining a local store of prayer times.\n\n### Why not just use <https://www.londonprayertimes.com>?\n\nThere are a few reasons:\n\n1.  The LUPT website is *not* the gold source for this data. It is run\n    by awesome volunteers who appear to manually upload transformed data\n    from elsewhere (probably ELM\\'s website). As this library is\n    intentionally designed to make a locally available copy, it\\'s\n    probably a better idea for it to go directly to a source of that data.\n2.  The primary role of the LUPT website appears to be to make time\n    strings available to mosque UI apps. Something like Home Assistant\n    requires data a little more \\\"machine-friendly\\\", like times in UTC or\n    epoch time. And again, if we\\'re to transform the LUPT website data\n    anyway then it makes more sense to go to a source.\n\n### Why is this written in Python?\n\nAlthough not my first choice of language, this library has primarily\nbeen written for use with Home Assistant, which itself is written in\nPython. Since this library doesn\\'t actually do that much, it made sense\nto keep it as native as possible.\n\nPlease excuse the anti-Python patterns - PRs are welcome. Although please,\nno comments on the lack of classes, that bit's deliberate.\n\n### Will you pray for me?\n\nOf course! But please be aware that I will not be responsible for you\nmissing Fajr.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis package was created with\n[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the\n[audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)\nproject template.\n\n\n# History\n\n## 1.0.0 (2021-02-15)\n\n-   First release on PyPI.\n\n\n",
