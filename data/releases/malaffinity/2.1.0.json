I don't have a better name to describe this, so please\nbear with me.**\n\n**In most cases, just assume that the \"base\" user is referring to you,\nor the person who will be running your script**\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install malaffinity\n\nAlternatively, download this repo and run:\n\n::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nOr copypasta the ``malaffinity`` directory to\nPython:raw-latex:`\\site`-packages and install the\n`dependencies <#dependencies>`__ yourself.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n-  BeautifulSoup4\n-  lxml\n-  Requests\n\nThese should be installed when you install this script, so no need to\nworry about them.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n1. Create an instance of the ``MALAffinity`` class, providing the param\n   ``base_user``, and an optional ``round`` to it.\n\n   -  The ``base_user`` is the username whose scores other scores will\n      be compared to.\n   -  Rounding of the final affinity is determined by the ``round``\n      param. To round results, provide a number of decimal places to\n      round to. For no rounding, specify ``False``\n   -  *Note that the class can be initialised without the ``base_user``\n      param, but a ``base_user`` **MUST** be passed to the ``init``\n      function before any affinity calculations take place. (See\n      `example 2 <#example-2>`__)*\n\n2. Calculate affinity between the \"base user\" and another user by\n   calling the ``calculate_affinity`` method with the username of the\n   person you wish to calculate affinity with.\n\n   -  This will return a tuple, containing the affinity, and the number\n      of shared rated anime.\n\n3. Calculate more affinities by repeating Step 2.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nUsing ``ma`` as the name of the initialised class, because I can't think\nof a better name that won't shadow anything that already/will exist(s).\n\nExample 1\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Basic usage**\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ma = MALAffinity(\"YOUR_USERNAME\")\n\n    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity(\"OTHER_USERNAME\")\n\n    print(affinity)\n    # 79.00545465639877\n    print(shared)\n    # 82\n\nExample 2\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Basic usage, but specifying a \"base user\" AFTER initialising the\nclass**\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ma = MALAffinity()\n\n    # This can be done anywhere as long as the place you're doing this from has access to `ma`.\n    ma.init(\"YOUR_USERNAME\")\n\n    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity(\"OTHER_USERNAME\")\n\n    print(affinity)\n    # 79.00545465639877\n    print(shared)\n    # 82\n\nExample 3\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Round affinities to two decimal places**\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ma = MALAffinity(\"YOUR_USERNAME\", round=2)\n\n    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity(\"OTHER_USERNAME\")\n\n    print(affinity)\n    # 79.01\n    print(shared)\n    # 82\n\nExample 4\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**One-off affinity calculations**\n\nNote that the ``calculate_affinity`` function is being used here - not\nthe method.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    affinity, shared = calculate_affinity(\"YOUR_USERNAME\", \"OTHER_USERNAME\")\n\n    print(affinity)\n    # 79.00545465639877\n    print(shared)\n    # 82\n\n*Don't use this if you're planning on calculating affinity again with\none of the users you've specified when doing this. It's better to create\nan instance of the ``MALAffinity`` class with said user, and calculating\naffinity with the other user(s) that way. That instance will hold said\nusers' scores, so they won't have to be retrieved again. See examples\n1-3*\n\nHandling exceptions\n-------------------\n\n**NOTE:** As of v2.0.0, these exceptions are now contained in the\n``exceptions`` file. Make sure to reference them properly if you'll be\ngoing down this path. (``malaffinity.exceptions.ExceptionName``).\n\nThree types of exceptions can be raised while calculating affinities:\n\n-  ``NoAffinityError``: Raised when either the shared rated anime\n   between the base user and another user is less than 10, or the other\n   user does not have any rated anime.\n-  ``InvalidUsernameError``: Raised when username specified does not\n   exist.\n-  ``MALRateLimitExceededError``: Raised when MAL's blocking your\n   request, because you're going over their rate limit of one request\n   every two seconds. Slow down and try again.\n\nNot much you can do about the first two, so you're best off giving up if\nyou run into one of those. The third, however, rarely happens if you\nabide by the rate limit, but the following should happen in case it\ndoes:\n\n-  Halt the script for a few seconds. I recommend five.\n-  Try again.\n-  If you get roadblocked again, just give up. MAL obviously hates you.\n\nThis can be achieved something along these lines:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    success = False\n\n    # Two attempts, then give up. Max tries can be adjusted here\n    for _ in range(2):\n        try:\n            affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity(\"OTHER_USERNAME\")\n\n        # Rate limit exceeded error. Halt your script and try again\n        except malaffinity.exceptions.MALRateLimitExceededError:\n            time.sleep(5)\n            continue\n\n        # Any other malaffinity exception. No point continuing to do \n        # anything if this comes up. `MALAffinityException` is the \n        # base exception class for all malaffinity exceptions\n        except malaffinity.exceptions.MALAffinityException:\n            break\n\n        # General exceptions not covered by malaffinity. Not sure what \n        # you could do here. Feel free to handle however you like\n        except Exception as e:\n            pass\n\n        # Success!\n        else:\n            success = True\n            break\n\n    # malaffinity failed to calculate affinity. You'll want to stop doing\n    # anything with this person and move onto the next, so use the statement\n    # that will best accomplish this, given the layout of your script\n    if not success:\n        return\n\nI'm thinking about hardcoding the rate limit handling in, but I'm\nworried about handling cases where MAL keeps blocking you - I don't want\nto run into infinite loops. I'll look into this one day.\n\nFeel free to use a loop though. Don't blame me if anything bad happens\nbecause of it.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n**Q: [A dumb question was here]**\n\nA: I have a bad memory and forgot floating point arithmetic was a thing.\n\nConcerns, problems, fixes, feedback, yada yada\n----------------------------------------------\n\nContact me on\n`Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=erkghlerngm44>`__ or\nby `Email <mailto:erkghlerngm44@protonmail.com>`__, or create an\n`issue <https://github.com/erkghlerngm44/malaffinity/issues>`__ or `pull\nrequest <https://github.com/erkghlerngm44/malaffinity/pulls>`__.\n\nThe email I specified isn't my main one, and this isn't my main Github\naccount, so if you do use those services, send me a message on Reddit,\nnotifying me, otherwise you'll probably receive a reply weeks/months\nafter you contact me.\n\nLegal stuff\n-----------\n\nLicensed under MIT.
