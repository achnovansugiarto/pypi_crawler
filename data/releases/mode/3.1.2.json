Services\n=====================================================================\n\n|build-status| |license| |wheel| |pyversion| |pyimp|\n\n:Version: 3.1.2\n:Web: http://mode.readthedocs.org/\n:Download: http://pypi.org/project/mode\n:Source: http://github.com/ask/mode\n:Keywords: async, service, framework, actors, bootsteps, graph\n\nWhat is Mode?\n=============\n\nMode is a very minimal Python library built-on top of AsyncIO that makes\nit much easier to use.\n\nIn Mode your program is built out of services that you can start, stop,\nrestart and supervise.\n\nA service is just a class::\n\n    class PageViewCache(Service):\n        redis: Redis = None\n\n        async def on_start(self) -> None:\n            self.redis = connect_to_redis()\n\n        async def update(self, url: str, n: int = 1) -> int:\n            return await self.redis.incr(url, n)\n\n        async def get(self, url: str) -> int:\n            return await self.redis.get(url)\n\n\nServices are started, stopped and restarted and have\ncallbacks for those actions.\n\nIt can start another service::\n\n    class App(Service):\n        page_view_cache: PageViewCache = None\n\n        async def on_start(self) -> None:\n            await self.add_runtime_dependency(self.page_view_cache)\n\n        @cached_property\n        def page_view_cache(self) -> PageViewCache:\n            return PageViewCache()\n\nIt can include background tasks::\n\n    class PageViewCache(Service):\n\n        @Service.timer(1.0)\n        async def _update_cache(self) -> None:\n            self.data = await cache.get('key')\n\nServices that depends on other services actually form a graph\nthat you can visualize.\n\nWorker\n    Mode optionally provides a worker that you can use to start the program,\n    with support for logging, blocking detection, remote debugging and more.\n\n    To start a worker add this to your program::\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            from mode import Worker\n            Worker(Service(), loglevel=\"info\").execute_from_commandline()\n\n    Then execute your program to start the worker:\n\n    .. sourcecode:: console\n\n        $ python examples/tutorial.py\n        [2018-03-27 15:47:12,159: INFO]: [^Worker]: Starting...\n        [2018-03-27 15:47:12,160: INFO]: [^-AppService]:

       [2018-03-27 15:55:08,087: INFO]: [^Worker]: -Stopped!\n\nBeacons\n    The ``beacon`` object that we pass to services keeps track of the services\n    in a graph.\n\n    They are not stricly required, but can be used to visualize a running\n    system, for example we can render it as a pretty graph.\n\n    This requires you to have the ``pydot`` library and GraphViz\n    installed:\n\n    .. sourcecode:: console\n\n        $ pip install pydot\n\n    Let's change the app service class to dump the graph to an image\n    at startup::\n\n        class AppService(Service):\n\n            async def on_start(self) -> None:\n                print('APP STARTING')\n                import pydot\n                import io\n                o = io.StringIO()\n                beacon = self.app.beacon.root or self.app.beacon\n                beacon.as_graph().to_dot(o)\n                graph, = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(o.getvalue())\n                print('WRITING GRAPH TO image.png')\n                with open('image.png', 'wb') as fh:\n                    fh.write(graph.create_png())\n\n\nCreating a Service\n==================\n\nTo define a service, simply subclass and fill in the methods\nto do stuff as the service is started/stopped etc.::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        async def on_start(self) -> None:\n            print('Im starting now')\n\n        async def on_started(self) -> None:\n            print('Im ready')\n\n        async def on_stop(self) -> None:\n            print('Im stopping now')\n\nTo start the service, call ``await service.start()``::\n\n    await service.start()\n\nOr you can use ``mode.Worker`` (or a subclass of this) to start your\nservices-based asyncio program from the console::\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        import mode\n        worker = mode.Worker(\n            MyService(),\n            loglevel='INFO',\n            logfile=None,\n            daemon=False,\n        )\n        worker.execute_from_commandline()\n\nIt's a Graph!\n=============\n\nServices can start other services, coroutines, and background tasks.\n\n1) Starting other services using ``add_depenency``::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        def __post_init__(self) -> None:\n           self.add_dependency(OtherService(loop=self.loop))\n\n2) Start a list of services using ``on_init_dependencies``::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        def on_init_dependencies(self) -> None:\n            return [\n                ServiceA(loop=self.loop),\n                ServiceB(loop=self.loop),\n                ServiceC(loop=self.loop),\n            ]\n\n3) Start a future/coroutine (that will be waited on to complete on stop)::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        async def on_start(self) -> None:\n            self.add_future(self.my_coro())\n\n        async def my_coro(self) -> None:\n            print('Executing coroutine')\n\n4) Start a background task::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        @Service.task\n        async def _my_coro(self) -> None:\n            print('Executing coroutine')\n\n\n5) Start a background task that keeps running::\n\n    class MyService(Service):\n\n        @Service.task\n        async def _my_coro(self) -> None:\n            while not self.should_stop:\n                # NOTE: self.sleep will wait for one second, or\n                #       until service stopped/crashed.\n                await self.sleep(1.0)\n                print('Background thread waking up')\n\n.. _installation:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install Mode either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)\nor from source.\n\nTo install using `pip`::\n\n    $ pip install -U mode\n\n.. _installing-from-source:\n\nDownloading and installing from source\n--------------------------------------\n\nDownload the latest version of Mode from\nhttp://pypi.org/project/mode\n\nYou can install it by doing the following::\n\n    $ tar xvfz mode-0.0.0.tar.gz\n    $ cd mode-0.0.0\n    $ python setup.py build\n    # python setup.py install\n\nThe last command must be executed as a privileged user if\nyou are not currently using a virtualenv.\n\n.. _installing-from-git:\n\nUsing the development version\n-----------------------------\n\nWith pip\n~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can install the latest snapshot of Mode using the following\npip command::\n\n    $ pip install https://github.com/ask/mode/zipball/master#egg=mode\n\nFAQ\n===\n\nCan I use Mode with Django/Flask/etc.?\n--------------------------------------\n\nYes! Use gevent/eventlet as a bridge to integrate with asyncio.\n\nUsing ``gevent``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis works with any blocking Python library that can work with gevent.\n\nUsing gevent requires you to install the ``aiogevent`` module,\nand you can install this as a bundle with Mode:\n\n.. sourcecode:: console\n\n    $ pip install -U mode[gevent]\n\nThen to actually use gevent as the event loop you have to\nexecute the following in your entrypoint module (usually where you\nstart the worker), before any other third party libraries are imported::\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n    import mode.loop\n    mode.loop.use('gevent')\n    # execute program\n\nREMEMBER: This must be located at the very top of the module,\nin such a way that it executes before you import other libraries.\n\n\nUsing ``eventlet``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis works with any blocking Python library that can work with eventlet.\n\nUsing eventlet requires you to install the ``aioeventlet`` module,\nand you can install this as a bundle with Mode:\n\n.. sourcecode:: console\n\n    $ pip install -U mode[eventlet]\n\nThen to actually use eventlet as the event loop you have to\nexecute the following in your entrypoint module (usually where you\nstart the worker), before any other third party libraries are imported::\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n    import mode.loop\n    mode.loop.use('eventlet')\n    # execute program\n\nREMEMBER: It's very important this is at the very top of the module,\nand that it executes before you import libraries.\n\nCan I use Mode with Tornado?\n----------------------------\n\nYes! Use the ``tornado.platform.asyncio`` bridge:\nhttp://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/asyncio.html\n\nCan I use Mode with Twisted?\n-----------------------------\n\nYes! Use the asyncio reactor implementation:\nhttps://twistedmatrix.com/documents/17.1.0/api/twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.html\n\nWill you support Python 3.5 or earlier?\n---------------------------------------\n\nThere are no immediate plans to support Python 3.5, but you are welcome to\ncontribute to the project.\n\nHere are some of the steps required to accomplish this:\n\n- Source code transformation to rewrite variable annotations to comments\n\n  for example, the code::\n\n        class Point:\n            x: int = 0\n            y: int = 0\n\n   must be rewritten into::\n\n        class Point:\n            x = 0  # type: int\n            y = 0  # type: int\n\n- Source code transformation to rewrite async functions\n\n    for example, the code::\n\n        async def foo():\n            await asyncio.sleep(1.0)\n\n    must be rewritten into::\n\n        @coroutine\n        def foo():\n            yield from asyncio.sleep(1.0)\n\nWill you support Python 2?\n--------------------------\n\nThere are no plans to support Python 2, but you are welcome to contribute to\nthe project (details in question above is relevant also for Python 2).\n\n\nAt Shutdown I get lots of warnings, what is this about?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you get warnings such as this at shutdown:\n\n.. sourcecode:: text\n\n    Task was destroyed but it is pending!\n    task: <Task pending coro=<Service._execute_task() running at /opt/devel/mode/mode/services.py:643> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[<TaskWakeupMethWrapper object at 0x1100a7468>()]>>\n    Task was destroyed but it is pending!\n    task: <Task pending coro=<Service._execute_task() running at /opt/devel/mode/mode/services.py:643> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[<TaskWakeupMethWrapper object at 0x1100a72e8>()]>>\n    Task was destroyed but it is pending!\n    task: <Task pending coro=<Service._execute_task() running at /opt/devel/mode/mode/services.py:643> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[<TaskWakeupMethWrapper object at 0x1100a7678>()]>>\n    Task was destroyed but it is pending!\n    task: <Task pending coro=<Event.wait() running at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/asyncio/locks.py:269> cb=[_release_waiter(<Future pendi...1100a7468>()]>)() at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/asyncio/tasks.py:316]>\n    Task was destroyed but it is pending!\n        task: <Task pending coro=<Event.wait() running at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/asyncio/locks.py:269> cb=[_release_waiter(<Future pendi...1100a7678>()]>)() at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/asyncio/tasks.py:316]>\n\nIt usually means you forgot to stop a service before the process exited.\n\nCode of Conduct\n===============\n\nEveryone interacting in the project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms,\nand mailing lists is expected to follow the Mode Code of Conduct.\n\nAs contributors and maintainers of these projects, and in the interest of fostering\nan open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute\nthrough reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,\nsubmitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.\n\nWe are committed to making participation in these projects a harassment-free\nexperience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender,\ngender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,\npersonal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,\nreligion, or nationality.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery\n* Personal attacks\n* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing other's private information, such as physical\n  or electronic addresses, without explicit permission\n* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct.
