Specifically, once you have a\nConfluence HTML export that has been [converted to Markdown](https://github.com/meridius/confluence-to-markdown),\nrun this utility against the converted source to move documents into a directory structure that mirrors\nthe confluence page hierarchy as well as generating the Jupyter Book-isms necessary to correctly publish\nback to confluence.\n\nTo run:\n\n```shell\n./con2jupyterbook -i <source-dr> -o <target-dir>\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nWhen exporting from confluence, an `index.md` file is generated that holds the exported page hierarchy in a\nnested list. This utility relies on that format, so the `index.md` file should not be edited prior to running \nthis utility.\n\n## What it does...\n\nThe HTML export from Confluence dumps the whole tree into a single directory. The con2jb will create a \ndirectory tree to mirror the page hierarchy from confluence and do some requisite fixup automatically. Additionally,\nit will generate the jupyter book table of contents to ensure that the correct page hierarchy is restored upon \npublication.\n\nThere are several other miscellaneous fixes that are performed including: referencing attachment and image links\nfrom the root rather than the current directory and removal of some sections that are added to a given page that are not\npresent in the Confluence page source, e.g. Comments, Attachment Lists, Change History.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n0) Prerequisites: Node.js installed, Python installed\n1) Use Confluence to export all or a part of your wiki via HTML. \n   ([Export Content...](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/export-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-139475.html))\n2) Create a working directory and unzip the Confluence export into that directory (sub-dir html)\n3) Clone [Confluence to Markdown](https://github.com/meridius/confluence-to-markdown)\n4) From within the cloned directory run `npm run start <working-dir>/html <working-dir>/markdown`\n5) `pip install migcon`\n6) Run con2jb to convert the exported markdown into a MyST, sphinx friendly markdown/dir structure\n    `con2jb -i <working-dir>/markdown -o <working-dir>/sphinx`\n7) Copy the resultant jupyter book friendly markdown into the project of your choice\n8) Use jupyter book to build your desired output. **Note:** this will result in a few warnings that \n    need to be addressed. \n\n",
