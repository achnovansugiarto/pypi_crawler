    "description": "Machinae Security Intelligence Collector\n========================================\n\n| Machinae is a tool for collecting intelligence from public sites/feeds about\n| various security-related pieces of data: IP addresses, domain names, URLs,\n| email addresses, file hashes and SSL fingerprints. It was inspired by\n| `Automater <https://github.com/1aN0rmus/TekDefense-Automater>`__, another excellent tool for collecting information. The Machinae\n| project was born from wishing to improve Automater in 4 areas:\n\n#. Codebase - Bring Automater to python3 compatibility while making the code\n   more pythonic\n#. Configuration - Use a more human readable configuration format (YAML)\n#. Inputs - Support JSON parsing out-of-the-box without the need to write\n   regular expressions, but still support regex scraping when needed\n#. Outputs - Support additional output types, including JSON, while making\n   extraneous output optional\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMachinae can be installed using pip3:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install machinae\n\nOr, if you're feeling adventurous, can be installed directly from github:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install git+https://github.com/HurricaneLabs/machinae.git\n\n| You will need to have whatever dependencies are required on your system for\n| compiling Python modules (on Debian based systems, ``python3-dev``), as well as\n| the libyaml development package (on Debian based systems, ``libyaml-dev``).\n\n| You'll also want to grab the `latest configuration file <https://github.com/HurricaneLabs/machinae/raw/master/machinae.yml>`__ and place it in\n| ``/etc/machinae.yml``.\n\nConfiguration File\n------------------\n\n| Machinae supports a simple configuration merging system to allow you to make\n| adjustments to the configuration without modifying the machinae.yml we provide\n| you, making configuration updates a snap. This is done by finding a system-wide\n| default configuration (default ``/etc/machinae.yml``), merging into that a\n| system-wide local configuration (``/etc/machinae.local.yml``) and finally a\n| per-user local configuration (``~/.machinae.yml``). The system-wide configuration\n| can also be located in the current working directory, can be set using the\n| ``MACHINAE_CONFIG`` environment variable, or of course by using the ``-c`` or\n| ``--config`` command line options. Configuration merging can be disabled by\n| passing the ``--nomerge`` option, which will cause Machinae to only load the\n| default system-wide configuration (or the one passed on the command line).\n\n| As an example of this, say you'd like to enable the Fortinet Category site,\n| which is disabled by default. You could modify ``/etc/machinae.yml``, but these\n| changes would be overwritten by an update. Instead, you can put the following\n| in either ``/etc/machinae.local.yml`` or ``~/.machinae.yml``:\n\n::\n\n    fortinet_classify:\n      default: true\n\nOr, conversely, to disable a site, such as Virus Total pDNS:\n\n::\n\n    vt_ip:\n      default: false\n    vt_domain:\n      default: false\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nMachinae usage is very similar to Automater:\n\n::\n\n    usage: machinae [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-d DELAY] [-f FILE] [--nomerge] [-o {D,J,N}]\n                    [-O {ipv4,ipv6,fqdn,email,sslfp,hash,url}] [-q] [-s SITES]\n                    targets [targets ...]\n\n-  See above for details on the ``-c``/``--config`` and ``--nomerge`` options.\n\n-  | Machinae supports a ``-d``/``--delay`` option, like Automater. However, Machinae\n   | uses 0 by default.\n\n-  Machinae output is controlled by two arguments:\n\n   -  ``-o`` controls the output format, and can be followed by a single character\n      to indicated the desired type of output:\n\n      -  *N* is the default output (\"Normal\")\n      -  *D* is the default output, but dot characters are replaced\n      -  *J* is JSON output\n\n   -  ``-f``/``--file`` specifies the file where output should be written. The default\n      is \"-\" for stdout.\n\n-  | Machinae will attempt to auto-detect the type of target passed in (Machinae\n   | refers to targets as \"observables\" and the type as \"otype\"). This detection can\n   | be overridden with the ``-O``/``--otype`` option. The choices are listed in the\n   | usage\n\n-  | By default, Machinae operates in verbose mode. In this mode, it will output\n   | status information about the services it is querying on the console as they are\n   | queried. This output will always be written to stdout, regardless of the output\n   | setting. To disable verbose mode, use ``-q``\n\n-  By default, Machinae will run through all services in the configuration that\n   apply to each target's otype *and* are not marked as \"default: false\". To modify\n   this behavior, you can:\n\n   -  Pass a comma separated list of sites to run (use the top level key from the\n      configuration).\n   -  Pass the special keyword ``all`` to run through all services *including* those\n      marked as \"default: false\"\n\n   Note that in both cases, ``otype`` validation is still applied.\n\n-  | Lastly, a list of targets should be passed. All arguments other than the\n   | options listed above will be interpreted as targets.\n\nOut-of-the-Box Data Sources\n---------------------------\n\nMachinae comes with out-of-the-box support for the following data sources:\n\n-  IPVoid\n-  URLVoid\n-  URL Unshortener (http://www.toolsvoid.com/unshorten-url)\n-  Malc0de\n-  SANS\n-  Telize GeoIP\n-  Fortinet Category\n-  VirusTotal pDNS (via web scrape - commented out)\n-  VirusTotal pDNS (via JSON API)\n-  VirusTotal URL Report (via JSON API)\n-  VirusTotal File Report (via JSON API)\n-  Reputation Authority\n-  ThreatExpert\n-  VxVault\n-  ProjectHoneypot\n-  McAfee Threat Intelligence\n-  StopForumSpam\n-  Cymru MHR\n-  ICSI Certificate Notary\n-  TotalHash (disabled by default)\n-  DomainTools Parsed Whois (Requires API key)\n-  DomainTools Reverse Whois (Requires API key)\n-  DomainTools Reputation\n-  IP WHOIS (Using RIR REST interfaces)\n\nWith additional data sources on the way.\n\nDisabled by default\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following sites are disabled by default\n\n-  Fortinet Category (``fortinet_classify``)\n-  TotalHash (``totalhash_ip``)\n-  DomainTools Parsed Whois (``domaintools_parsed_whois``)\n-  DomainTools Reverse Whois (``domaintools_reverse_whois``)\n-  DomainTools Reputation (``domaintools_reputation``)\n\nOutput Formats\n--------------\n\n| Machinae comes with a limited set of output formats: normal, normal with dot\n| escaping, and JSON. We plan to add additional output formats in the future.\n\nAdding additional sites\n-----------------------\n\n\\*\\*\\* COMING SOON \\*\\*\\*\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\n-  Some ISP's on IPvoid contain double-encoded HTML entities, which are not\n   double-decoded\n\nUpcoming Features\n-----------------\n\n-  Add IDS rule search functionality (VRT/ET)\n-  Add \"More info\" link for sites\n-  Add \"dedup\" option to parser settings\n-  Add option for per-otype request settings\n-  Add custom per-site output for error codes\n\nVersion History\n---------------\n\nVersion 1.3.1 (2016-03-08)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  New features\n\n   -  Prepend \"http://\" to URL targets when not starting with http:// or https://\n\nVersion 1.3.0 (2016-03-07)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  New sites\n\n   -  Cymon.io - Threat intel aggregator/tracker by eSentire\n\n-  New features\n\n   -  Support simple paginated responses\n   -  Support url encoding 'target' in request URL\n   -  Support url decoding values in results\n\nVersion 1.2.0 (2016-02-16)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  New features\n\n   -  Support for sites returning multiple JSON documents\n   -  Ability to specify time format for relative time parameters\n   -  Ability to parse Unix timestamps in results and display in ISO-8601 format\n   -  Ability to specify status codes to ignore per-API\n\n-  New sites\n\n   -  DNSDB - FarSight Security Passive DNS Data base (premium)\n\nVersion 1.1.2 (2015-11-26)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  New sites\n\n   -  Telize (premium) - GeoIP site (premium)\n   -  Freegeoip - GeoIP site (free)\n   -  CIF - CIFv2 API support, from csirtgadgets.org\n\n-  New features\n\n   -  Ability to specify labels for single-line multimatch JSON outputs\n   -  Ability to specify relative time parameters using relatime library\n\nVersion 1.0.1 (2015-10-13)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Fixed a false-positive bug with Spamhaus (Github#10)\n\nVersion 1.0.0 (2015-07-02)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Initial release\n\nLicense Info\n------------\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Hurricane Labs LLC\n\n| Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n| of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n| in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n| to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n| copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n| furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n| The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n| all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n| THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n| IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n| FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
