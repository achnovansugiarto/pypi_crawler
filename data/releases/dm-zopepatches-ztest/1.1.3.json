    "description": "This package defines the (console) script ``ztest``, a small wrapper\naround the Zope (3) testrunner to run tests of Zope (2) application components\n(often so called Zope (2) products).\n\nUntil Zope 2.11, its functionality was available as ``bin/zopectl test``.\nFor Zope 2.12,\nZope developers switched to ``buildout`` for Zope development itself\nand (to save some work) dropped support for ``bin/zopectl test``.\nThus, developers of Zope application components (like me) were forced\neither to switch to ``buildout``, to renounce testing or to build something\nlike ``ztest``.\n\nMy experience with ``buildout`` has not been good: compared with\na more traditional (and more manual) ``virtualenv``,\n``buildout`` gave me much more surprises (surprising upgrades),\nmuch more waiting time due to unnecessary rebuildings and was\nfar less reliable (due to problems of internet servers scanned for\nsources). Therefore, I do not want to switch to ``buildout``.\nOf course, I do not want to renounce testing.\nThus, I stiched the Zope 2.11 code together to build ``ztest``.\n\n``ztest`` can also be used together with ``buildout``.\nA ``buildout`` part definition for ``ztest`` could look like::\n\n  [ztest]\n  recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts\n  eggs =\n    dm.zopepatches.ztest\n    ${buildout:eggs}\n  extra-paths =\n    ${zope2:location}/lib/python\n\nIt creates a script ``bin/ztest`` that can test packages either in\nZope or in the available eggs.\n\n\nBasic usage\n===========\n\nztest -h\n  list the available options\n\nztest [--config-file *config_file*] -s *package*\n  run tests for *package*. If given, use *config_file* as the Zope\n  configuration file\n\nztest [--config-file *config_file*] --package-path *file_path_to_package* *package* -s *package*\n  occationally, the testrunner is too stupid to find the tests in a package.\n  Then it is necessary to specify its file path with the ``--package-path``\n  option.\n\n\nHistory\n=======\n\n1.1.3\n  Bugfix: a module filter was usually not effective\n\n1.1.2\n  support for Zope 2.10\n\n1.1\n  try to determine 'package-path' automatically by a trial import. May not always work.",
