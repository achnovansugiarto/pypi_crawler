This\nshould suffice for simple sites like shopping carts, online sales, etc.\n\nPull requests are always welcome. Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you\nencounter a problem. New features will generally only be added as needed, but\nagain, accepted if you submit a patch.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation should generally be done via pip::\n\n    pip install django-mercadopago\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nYou'll need to obtainer your API credentials (``app id`` and ``secret key``)\n`here <https://applications.mercadopago.com/>`_ and  create an ``Account``\nobject with them. This creation can be done via the django admin included with\nthis app or programmatically.\n\nYou should also expose the notifications endpoints like this::\n\n    url(r'^mercadopago/', include('django_mercadopago.urls'), namespace='mp'),\n    # Make sure namespace is 'mp', since we assume it is for notification URL\n    # contruction.\n\nNote that these endpoints are **required**, since notification callbacks won't\nwork without them.\n\nThere are also a few Django settings that configure the behaviour of this app.\nAll these settings are included in a single ``dict`` inside your Django\nsettings::\n\n    MERCADOPAGO = {\n        'autoprocess': True,\n        'success_url': 'myapp:mp_success',\n        'failure_url': 'myapp:mp_failure',\n        'pending_url': 'myapp:mp_pending',\n        'base_host': 'https://www.mysite.com\n    }\n\nSee below for an explanation of each setting.\n\nAUTOPROCESS\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Required**\n\nIf set to ``True``, notifications will be processed as soon as they are\nreceived. Otherwise, it's up to the developer to process them.\n\nA signal is always fired when a notification has been created, and a common\npattern if not auto-processing is to have a celery task to process them::\n\n    @receiver(notification_received)\n    def process_notification(sender, **kwargs):\n        tasks.process_notification.delay(notification=sender)\n\nSUCCESS_URL\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Required**\n\nThe named URL pattern where requests are redirected after a user successfully\ncompletes a payment. This url will receive as an argument the ``id`` of the\nnotification created for this payment.\n\nFor example, this if this value were set to ``payment_recived``, a\ncorresponding URL pattern would look like this::\n\n    url(\n        r'pago_recibido/(?P<pk>.*)$',\n        order.OrderPaidView.as_view(),\n        name='payment_received',\n    ),\n\nFAILURE_URL\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Required**\n\nThe named URL pattern where requests are redirected after a user payment fails.\nThis url will receive as an argument the ``id`` of the preference that the user\nattempted to pay\n\n\nPENDING_URL\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Required**\n\nThe named URL pattern where requests are redirected after a user completes a\npayment, but confirmation is pending (for example, a transaction that takes a\nfew days, bank deposit, etc).\nThis url will receive as an argument the ``id`` of the preference that the user\nis attempting to pay.\n\nBASE_HOST\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Required**\n\nDefines the domain name to use for notification and callback URLs.  It'll be\nprepended to the exact URL of the exposed notifications endpoint.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nMercadoPago lets you create preferences, for which you'll later receive\nnotifications (indicating if it was paid, or what happened)::\n\n    self.preference = Preference.objects.create(\n        title='the product name',\n        price=10.0,\n        reference='order-38452',\n        success_url='http://example.com/mp_done',\n        account=account,\n    )\n\nIf your app will only be using a single MercadoPago account, just use::\n\n    account = Account.objects.first()\n\nFinally, you can handle payment notifications in real time using a\n``post_update`` hook::\n\n    @receiver(post_save, sender=MercadoPagoPayment)\n    def process_payment(sender, instance=None, created=False, **kwargs):\n        do_stuff()\n\nBackwards compatibility\n-----------------------\n\nAs of v5.0.0, the notification and callback URL formats generated by v4.2.0 and\nearlier is no longer supported. Users must upgrade to v4.3.0, and run this\nversion until all pending payments are completed (or expire), and only then\nupgrade to v5.0.0.\n\nNote that, prior to v4.2.0, this package was called\n``django-mercadopago-simple`` on PyPI. Older release exist under that name.\n\nVersion 2.0.0 changes the database schema quite a bit. While older data is\nretained, some missing fields had to be filled. Auto-generated data will have\nnegative key values, and should easily be recognizable.\n\nRegrettably, filling in this data automatically is not possible. However, there\nis no data loss involved.\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nThis software is distributed under the ISC licence. See LICENCE for details.\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2018 Hugo Osvaldo Barrera <hugo@barrera.io>\n\n\n",
