    "description": "localtodo\n=========\n\n.gitignore local todo files, but sync them through Dropbox.\n\n\nWhat this is\n------------\n\nI like to use a ``LOCAL_TODO`` file for each of my projects as a\nwhiteboard for ideas, notes on what is currently being worked on\n(useful when coming back to a project after some time), and things\nin that vein.\n\nBecause these files are not under version control, I use Dropbox to\nsync them across machines (this also serves as a backup).\n\nWhat this script does is place such a file in a shared folder (for\nexample, managed by Dropbox), and then links this file into the\ncurrent directory.\n\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\nInstall via:\n\n    $ easy_install localtodo\n\nAdd the following line to your ``.gitignore`` file (or something\nequivalent for the respective ignore mechanism of your version\ncontrol system)::\n\n    /LOCAL_TODO*\n\nThe trailing wildcard will allows for multiple todo files, something\nthis script supports.\n\nIn your project directory, run::\n\n    $ localtodo --to ~/Dropbox/todofiles\n    Creating new empty file ~/Dropbox/todofiles/myproject\n\n    I have established the following links for you:\n        ./LOCAL_TODO --> ~/Dropbox/todofiles/myproject\n\n.. note::\n\n    The ``--to`` argument is only required the first time and is\n    cached in ``~/.localtodo``.\n\nAs you can see, this created a new file in your chosen folder, and\ncreated a link to it in the current directory.\n\nBy default, the name of the todo file will be inferred from the\nbasename of the current directory. You can also specify a custom name::\n\n    $ localtodo foo\n    Creating new empty file ~/Dropbox/todofiles/foo\n\n    I have established the following links for you:\n        ./LOCAL_TODO --> ~/Dropbox/todofiles/foo\n\nIf the todo file already exists, it will not be overridden. If\na LOCAL_TODO file already exists in the current directory, it will\nbe used and copied. So when you start working on your project on a\ndifferent machine, you again run the script::\n\n    $ localtodo\n    Found existing file ~/Dropbox/todofiles/foo\n\n    I have established the following links for you:\n        ./LOCAL_TODO --> ~/Dropbox/todofiles/foo\n\nMultiple todo files for one project\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible to create **sub-todos**::\n\n    $ localtodo -s docs\n    Creating new empty file ~/Dropbox/todos/myproject.docs\n\n    I have established the following links for you:\n        ./LOCAL_TODO.docs --> ~/Dropbox/todos/myproject.docs\n\n\nWhen running ``localtodo``, it will find all the todo files related\nto the current project, and link all of them into the current\ndirectory.",
