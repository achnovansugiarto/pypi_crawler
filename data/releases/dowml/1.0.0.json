The script `dowml.py` is an interactive program on top of that library.\n\nIn order to use either of them, you need to provide IBM Cloud credentials.\n1. By default, `DOWMLLib` (and therefore the Interactive) look for these credentials in an environment variable named `DOWML_CREDENTIALS`. This variable shoud have a value looking like\n   ```\n   {\n       'apikey': '<apikey>',\n       'url': 'https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com',\n       'cos_resource_crn' = 'crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/76260f9...',\n       'ml_instance_crn': 'crn:v1:bluemix:public:pm-20:eu-de:a/76260f...',\n   }\n   ```\n   See below for how/where to get these credentials.\n2. As an alternative, you can specify a file name as argument to `DOWMLLib.__init__`. The credentials will then be read from that file instead of the environment variable. Accordingly, the Interactive has a command line option `-w` (or `--wml-cred-file`) that must be followed by the path of the file.\n\nHere's a sample session:\n```\n$ dowml -h\nusage: interactive.py [-h] [--wml-cred-file WML_CRED_FILE] [--verbose]\n                      [--commands [COMMANDS [COMMANDS ...]]] [--input] [--space SPACE]\n\nInteractive program for DO on WML\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --wml-cred-file WML_CRED_FILE, -w WML_CRED_FILE\n                        Name of the file from which to read WML credentials. If not specified,\n                        credentials are read from environment variable $DOWML_CREDENTIALS.\n  --verbose, -v         Verbose mode. Causes the program to print debugging messages about its\n                        progress. Multiple -v options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 4.\n  --commands [COMMANDS [COMMANDS ...]], -c [COMMANDS [COMMANDS ...]]\n                        Carries out the specified commands. Each command is executed as if it had\n                        been specified at the prompt. The program stops after last command, unless\n                        --input is used.\n  --input, -i           Prompts for new input commands even if some commands have been specified\n                        as arguments using --commands.\n  --space SPACE, -s SPACE\n                        Id of the space to connect to. Takes precedence over the one specified in\n                        the credentials under the 'space_id' key, if any.\n$\n$\n$ dowml -c help type size 'inline yes' 'solve examples/afiro.mps' jobs wait jobs log 'type docplex' 'solve examples/markshare.py examples/markshare1.mps.gz' wait jobs output 'shell ls -l *-*-*-*-*'\n\nDecision Optimization in WML Interactive, version 0.9.0.\nSubmit and manage Decision Optimization models interactively.\n(c) Copyright IBM Corp. 2021\n\nType ? for a list of commands.\n\nMost commands need an argument that can be either a job id, or the number\nof the job, as displayed by the 'jobs' command.

Two pieces of information are required, and the others\nare optional.\n\n### Required items\n\n1. The `apikey` is a secret that identifies the IBM Cloud user. One typically creates\n   one key per application or service, in order to be able to revoke them individually\n   if needed.\n   To generate such a key, open https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys, and click the blue\n   'Create an IBM Cloud API key' on the right.\n\n2. The `url` is the base URL for the REST calls to WML.  The possible values are\n   found in https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/machine-learning, and depend on which\n   region you want to use.\n\n### Optional items\n\nWatson Studio and Watson Machine Learning use _spaces_ to group together, and\nisolate from each other, the assets that belong to a single project.  These assets \ninclude the data files submitted, the results of the jobs, and the _deployments_\n(software and hardware configurations) that run these jobs.\n\nThe DOWML client will connect to the space specified by the user using\neither the `--space` command-line argument or the `space_id` item in the credentials.\nIf neither of these are specified, the client will look for a space named \n_DOWMLClient-space_, and will try to create such a space if one doesn't exist.\nTo create a new space, the DOWML client will need both `cos_resource_crn` and\n`ml_instance_crn` to have been specified in the credentials.\n\n3. `space_id`: identifier of an existing space to connect to.  Navigate to the \n   'Spaces' tab of your Watson Studio site (e.g. \n   https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/ml-runtime/spaces if you are using\n   the instance in Germany), right-click on the name of an existing space to\n   copy the link. The id of the space is the string of numbers, letters and dashes\n   between the last `/` and the `?`.\n\n3. `cos_resource_crn`: WML needs to store some data in a Cloud Object Storage \n   instance.  Open\n   https://cloud.ibm.com/resources and locate the 'Storage' section.  Create an\n   instance of the Cloud Object Storage service if needed. Once it's listed on\n   the resource page, click anywhere on the line for that service, except on its\n   name.  This will open a pane on the right which lists the CRN.  Click on the\n   symbol at the right to copy this information.  This item is required only for \n   the DOWML client to be able to create a space.  If you specified a `space_id`,\n   it is not required.\n   \n4. `ml_instance_crn`: similarly, you need to identify an instance of Machine \n   Learning service to use\n   to solve your jobs.  In the same page https://cloud.ibm.com/resources, open the\n   'Services' section.  The 'Product' columns tells you the type of service.  If\n   you don't have a 'Machine Learning' instance already, create one.  Then click\n   on the corresponding line anywhere except on the name, and copy the CRN displayed\n   in the pane that open on the right.  This item is required only for \n   the DOWML client to be able to create a space.  If you specified a `space_id`,\n   it is not required.\n\n## Using data assets in Watson Studio\n\nThe DOWML library has two modes of operation with respect to sending the models\nto the WML service: inline data, or using data assets in Watson Studio.  By default,\ndata assets are used. This can be changed with the `inline` command.\n\nWith inline data, the model is sent directly to the WML service in the _solve_\nrequest itself.  This is the simplest, but it has a number of drawbacks:\n\n- Sending a large model may take a long time, because of network throughput.  Sending\na very large REST request is not at all guaranteed to succeed.\n\n- When solving several times the same model (e.g. to evaluate different parameters),\nthe model has to be sent each time.\n\n- In order to display the names of the files that were sent, the _jobs_ command\nneeds to request this information, and it comes with the content of the files\n  themselves.  In other words, every _jobs_ command requires downloading the content\n  of all the files for all the jobs that exist in the space.\n\nUsing data assets in Watson Studio as an intermediate step alleviate all these issues:\n\n- Once the model has been uploaded to Watson Studio, it will be reused for\nsubsequent jobs without the need to upload it again.\n\n- The job requests refer to the files indirectly, via URLs.  Therefore, they don't\ntake much space, and listing the jobs doesn't imply to download the content of the\n  files.\n\n- Uploading to Watson Studio is done through specialized code that doesn't just send a single\nrequest.  Rather, it divides the upload in multiple reasonably sized chunks that each\n  are uploaded individually, with restart if necessary.  Uploading big files is\n  therefore much less prone to failure.\n\n\n\n",
