Longbow\nis designed to reproduce the look and feel of using software on the users\nlocal computer with the difference that the heavy lifting is done by a\nsupercomputer.\n\nLongbow will automatically generate the necessary submit files and handle all\ninitial file transfer, monitor jobs, transfer files at configurable\nintervals and perform final file transfer and cleanup.\n\nLongbow can be used to launch one-off jobs, generate ensembles of similar jobs\nor even run many different jobs over many different supercomputers.\n\nOut of the box, Longbow is currently supporting the PBS/Torque, LSF, SGE,\nSlurm, SoGE schedulers and ships with application plugins for commonly used\nbio-molecular simulation softwares AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD.\nLongbow is however highly configurable and will function normally with generic\nsoftware without plugins, however plugins can easily be made to extend Longbow\nto fully support applications and schedulers that do not ship out of the box.\n\nUsing Longbow can be as simple as the following example:\n\nlocal: executable -a arg1 -b arg2 -c arg3\n\nremote: longbow executable -a arg1 -b arg2 -c arg3\n\nLongbow is also available to developers of applications which require support\nfor automating job submission. Longbow is available as a convenient and\nlight-weight python API that can be integrated in a number of different way.\n\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nLongbow is released under the BSD 3-clause license. A copy of this license is\nprovided when Longbow is downloaded and installed.\n\n\nCiting\n======\n\nIf you make use of Longbow in your own code or in production simulations that\nresult in publishable output, then please reference our paper:\n\nGebbie-Rayet, J, Shannon, G, Loeffler, H H and Laughton, C A 2016 Longbow: \nA Lightweight Remote Job Submission Tool. Journal of Open Research Software, \n4: e1, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.95\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nReleases can be installed either via pip or can be installed manually, to\ninstall via pip:\n\npip install longbow\n\nor to install manually (see docs) Longbow can be downloaded here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow\n\nand then extract and run the setup.py script to install.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation for Longbow users can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-docs\n\nDocumentation for developers interested in integrating Longbow into other\nsoftware can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-devdocs\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nExample files can be installed either through the Longbow command-line or by\ndownloading from the HECBioSim website manually:\n\nlongbow --examples\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-examples\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nSupport for any issues arising from using Longbow, whether these are questions,\nto report a bug or to suggest new ideas. You should use the Longbow forums\nhere:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-support\n\n\nDevelopers\n==========\n\nDevelopers that wish to contribute to Longbow are welcome. We do ask that if\nyou wish to contribute to the Longbow base code that you contact us first.\n\nThe following resources are available to developers:\n\nCode repository: https://github.com/hecbiosim/longbow\n\nUnit testing: https://travis-ci.org/HECBioSim/Longbow\n\nCode coverage: https://coveralls.io/github/HECBioSim/Longbow\n\nCode quality: https://landscape.io/github/HECBioSim/Longbow",
