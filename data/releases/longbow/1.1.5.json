    "description": "Longbow is a piece of software that acts as a job proxying tool for \nbiomolecular simulations, Longbow reproduces the native look and feel of using\npopular molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD),\nwith the difference that when those packages are used through Longbow \nsimulations can be run on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources such as \nARCHER. Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, \nautomatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back \nsimulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage \n(realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a \nspecified time interval.\n\n\nThis is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to \nthe user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do\nnot have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have \nto worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating \nlarge ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it \nsupports.\n\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nLongbow is released under the GNU GPLv2 license. A copy of this license will\nbe provided with the Longbow application when it is downloaded and installed.\n\n\nCiting\n======\n\nIf you make use of Longbow in your own code or in production simulations that\nresult in publishable output, then please reference our paper:\n\nGebbie-Rayet, J, Shannon, G, Loeffler, H H and Laughton, C A 2016 Longbow: \nA Lightweight Remote Job Submission Tool. Journal of Open Research Software, \n4: e1, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.95\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nReleases can be installed either via pip or can be installed manually, to\ninstall via pip:\n\npip install longbow\n\nor to install manually (see docs) Longbow can be downloaded here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow\n\nPlease note: In cases where you run the setup script, Longbow will create the\nhost configuration file in a hidden directory in your user directory. In some\ncases doing a manual install (not using the setup.py) then you will have to\nmake this yourself.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation for Longbow can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-docs\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nExample files can be installed either through the Longbow command-line or by\ndownloading from the HECBioSim website manually here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-examples\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nSupport for any issues arising from using Longbow, whether these are questions, \nto report bug or to suggest new ideas. You should use the Longbow forums here:\n\nhttp://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-support\n\n\nDevelopers\n==========\n\nDevelopers of software that wish to contribute to Longbow/integrate Longbow \ninto other software tools are welcome, we do ask that if you wish to contribute\nto the Longbow base code that you contact us first. The following resources are\navailable to developers:\n\nsource code: https://bitbucket.org/jimboid/longbow\n\ndocumentation: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-devdocs\n\n\nContact\n=======\n\nShould you need to contact the authors of this software, please contact:\n\nJames Gebbie-Rayet - james.gebbie@stfc.ac.uk\n\nGareth Shannon - gareth.shannon@nottingham.ac.uk\n\nPlease note, support will not be given via email, support should always come\nthrough our forums.",
