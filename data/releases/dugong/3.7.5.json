    "description": "==========================\n The Python Dugong Module\n==========================\n\n.. default-role:: code\n\n.. start-intro\n\nThe Python Dugong module provides an API for communicating with HTTP\n1.1 servers. It is an alternative to the standard library's\n`http.client` (formerly *httplib*) module. In contrast to\n`http.client`, Dugong:\n\n- allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without\n  having to read the responses first.\n\n- supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.\n\n- raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the\n  connection is closed before all data has been received.\n\n- raises one specific exception (`ConnectionClosed`) if the connection\n  has been closed (while `http.client` connection may raise any of\n  `BrokenPipeError`, `~http.client.BadStatusLine`,\n  `ConnectionAbortedError`, `ConnectionResetError`,\n  `~http.client.IncompleteRead` or simply return ``''`` on read)\n\n- supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with\n  the asyncio_ module.\n\n- can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and\n  an unresolvable hostname.\n\n- is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.\n\nAll request and response headers are represented as `str`, but must be\nencodable in latin1. Request and response body must be `bytes-like\nobjects`_ or binary streams.\n\nDugong requires Python 3.3 or newer.\n\n.. _`bytes-like objects`: http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object\n.. _asyncio: http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nAs usual: download the tarball from PyPi_, extract it, and run ::\n\n  # python3 setup.py install [--user]\n\nTo run the self-tests, install `py.test`_ with the `pytest-catchlog`_\nplugin and run ::\n\n  # python3 -m pytest test/\n\n.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dugong/#downloads\n.. _py.test: http://www.pytest.org/\n.. _pytest-catchlog: https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog\n\n\nGetting Help\n============\n\nThe documentation can be `read online`__ and is also included in the\n*doc/html* directory of the dugong tarball.\n\nPlease report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion and\nquestions, please subscribe to the `dugong mailing list`_.\n\n.. __: http://www.rath.org/dugong-docs/\n.. _dugong mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-dugong\n.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/python-dugong/python-dugong/issues\n\n\nDevelopment Status\n==================\n\nThe Dugong API is not yet stable and may change from one release to\nthe other. Starting with version 3.5, Dugong uses semantic\nversioning. This means changes in the API will be reflected in an\nincrease of the major version number, i.e. the next\nbackwards-incompatible version will be 4.0. Projects designed for\ne.g. version 3.5 of Dugong are thus recommended to declare a\ndependency on ``dugong >= 3.5, < 4.0``.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThe LLFUSE source code is available on GitHub_.\n\nProfessional Support\n--------------------\n\nProfessional support is offered via `Rath Consulting`_.\n\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-dugong/python-dugong\n.. _`Rath Consulting`: http://www.rath-consulting.biz/\n",
