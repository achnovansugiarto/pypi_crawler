If not specified, tries ``manifest.py`` then ``manifest.yml`` in\n  the current directory.\n\n\nManifest file\n=============\n\nA manifest file defines a list of more or apps which will be deployed to one host.\n\nYAML\n----\n\nA manifest file has two sections:\n\n``apps``:\n  The list of app definitions.\n\n  Each app starts with its identifier. This is used as its namespace for\n  docker-compose.\n\n  Under the identifier you can declare the type of app with ``type``; if not specified\n  it will default to ``type: App``. See \"App Types\" for more details and additional\n  arguments for the app definition.\n\n  An app can also specify environment variables to pass to docker-compose, by setting\n  ``env`` with a file path, a list of files, or key/value pairs.\n\n``host``:\n  The host definition.\n\n  There can be only one per manifest.\n\n\nApp types\n---------\n\n``App``:\n  A project with a docker-compose ready for use in production.\n\n  Arguments:\n\n  ``path``\n    Path to the app. Any ``app://`` paths elsewhere in the app definition will use this\n    as the base path.\n\n  ``extends``\n    Path to a base docker0s manifest for this app.\n\n    A base manifest:\n\n    * uses the same syntax\n    * can define multiple apps\n    * must not define a host\n\n    This value can be one of two patterns:\n\n    * ``path/to/manifest.yml`` or ``path/to/manifest.py`` - this app will extend using\n      the app defined with the same name - see \"App naming\" below\n    * ``path/to/manifest.yml::AppName`` or ``path/to/manifest.py::AppName`` - this app\n      will extend using the app defined with the name ``AppName``.\n\n    Default: ``None``\n\n  ``compose``\n    Path to the app's docker compose file.\n\n    Default: ``app://docker-compose.yml``\n\n  ``assets``:\n    Path or list of paths to assets which should be uploaded into an ``assets`` dir next\n    to the docker-compose. Must be ``app://`` paths.\n\n  ``env_file``\n    Path or list of paths to files containing environment variables for docker-compose.\n    See \"Environment variables\" below for details.\n\n  ``env``\n    Key-value pairs of environment variables for docker-compose.\n    See \"Environment variables\" below for details.\n\n  Example YAML:\n\n  .. code-block:: yaml\n\n      apps:\n        website:\n          path: \"git+ssh://git@github.com:radiac/example.com.git\"\n          extends: \"app://docker0s-base.py\"\n          config: \"app://docker-compose.live.yml\"\n          env_file:\n          - app://base.env\n          - website.env\n          env:\n            deployment=www.example.com\n\n\n\n``MountedApp``:\n  A project which requires the repository to be cloned on the host and mounted into\n  the service.\n\n  Takes the same arguments as an ``App``, with the following differences:\n\n  ``path``\n    Path to the app. This must be a git repository.\n\n  ``compose``\n    Path to the app's docker compose file. This must be an ``app://`` path within the\n    repository.\n\n  Example YAML:\n\n  .. code-block:: yaml\n\n      apps:\n        website:\n          type: MountedApp\n          path: \"git+ssh://git@github.com:radiac/example.com.git\"\n\n\nApp naming\n----------\n\nBecause apps are referenced by name in Python, YAML and on the command line, docker0s\nsupports apps names in ``PascalCase``, ``camelCase``, ``snake_case`` and ``kebab-case``\nin YAML and the command line.\n\nPython classes must use ``PascalCase``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class WebsiteExampleCom(App):\n        path = \"../website\"\n\nYAML can use any - these four app definitions are equivalent (so would raise an error):\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    apps:\n      website_example_com:\n        path: ../website\n      website-example-com:\n        path: ../website\n      websiteExampleCom:\n        path: ../website\n      WebsiteExampleCom:\n        path: ../website\n\n\nPaths\n-----\n\nAn App ``path`` can be:\n\n* relative to the manifest, eg ``traefik.env`` or ``../../apps/traefik/manifest.yml``.\n  Note this is relative to the manifest where this app definition is found, so relative\n  paths in a base manifest loaded with ``extend`` will be relative to the base manifest.\n* absolute, eg ``/etc/docker0s/apps/traefik/manifest.yml``.\n* a file in a git repository in the format ``git+<protocol>://<path>@<ref>#<file>``\n  where protocol is one of ``git+https`` or ``git+ssh``, and the ref is a\n  branch, commit or tag. For example:\n\n  * ``git+ssh://git@github.com:radiac/docker0s@main#apps/traefik/manifest.yml``\n  * ``git+https://github.com/radiac/docker0s@v1.0#apps/traefik/manifest.yml``\n\n\nOther fields which take a path argument (ie ``manifest``, ``compose`` and ``env_file``)\ncan use these values, as well as:\n\n* relative to the app's path with ``app://``, eg if ``path = \"../../apps/traefik\"``\n  then if ``extends = \"app://docker0s.py\"`` it will look for the base manifest at\n  ``../../apps/traefik/docker0s.py``\n\nFor security, when using a remote manifest from a third party git repository, we\nrecommend performing a full audit of what you are going to deploy, and then pinning to\nthat specific commit.\n\n\nEnvironment variables\n---------------------\n\nEnvironment variables for the docker-compose can be defined as one or more env files, as\na dict within the manifest, or both.\n\nIf more than one ``env_file`` is specified, files are loaded in order. If a key appears\nin more than one file, the last value loaded will be used.\n\nIf a key appears in both the ``env`` dict and an ``env_file``, the value in this field\nwill be used.\n\nEnvironment variables are evaluated before inheritance, meaning an env file key in a\nchild manifest can override an env dict key in a parent. Precedence order, with winner\nfirst:\n\n#. Child env dict\n#. Child env file\n#. Parent env dict\n#. Parent env file\n\nEnvironment variables are merged and written to an env file on the server for\ndocker-compose to use.\n\n\nDeployment\n==========\n\nDefault deployment structure::\n\n    /home/user/\n      apps/\n        app_name/\n          service_name/\n            docker-compose.yml\n            env\n        mounted_app_with_store/\n          service_name/\n            repo/\n              docker-compose.yml\n            store/\n            env\n\n\n",
