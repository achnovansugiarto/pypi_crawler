The templates use [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com).\n\nThere are also template tags for displaying data in your own templates (see below).\n\nThis is used on my personal website (with custom templates): [reading](https://www.gyford.com/phil/reading/) and [events](https://www.gyford.com/phil/events/).\n\nContents\n--------\n\n1.

[Contact](#contact)\n\n## 1. Installation\n\nInstall [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) or [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (used by [ImageKit](https://django-imagekit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create thumbnail images).\n\nInstall with pip:\n\n    pip install django-spectator\n\nAdd these apps to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        \"imagekit\",\n        \"spectator.core\",\n        \"spectator.events\",\n        \"spectator.reading\",\n    ]\n\nWhile `spectator.core` is required, you can omit either `spectator.events` or `spectator.reading` if you only want to use one of them.\n\n`imagekit` is required to handle uploaded publication cover and event ticket images.\n\nRun migrations:\n\n    ./manage.py migrate\n\nAdd to your project's `urls.py`:\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        # ...\n        path(\"spectator/\", include(\"spectator.core.urls\")),\n    ]\n\nYou can change the initial path (`\"spectator/\"`) to whatever suits you. e.g. use `\"\"` to have Spectator's home page be the front page of your site.\n\nThen, go to Django Admin to add your data.\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are a few optional settings that can be used in your project's `settings.py` file. This is the full list, with their defaults. Descriptions of each are below:\n\n    SPECTATOR_MAPS = {\"enable\": False}\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_ALPHABET = \"abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz23456789\"\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_SALT = \"Django Spectator\"\n\n    SPECTATOR_DATE_FORMAT = \"%-d %b %Y\"\n\n    SPECTATOR_THUMBNAIL_DETAIL_SIZE = (320, 320)\n\n    SPECTATOR_THUMBNAIL_LIST_SIZE = (80, 160)\n\n    SPECTATOR_EVENTS_DIR_BASE = \"events\"\n\n    SPECTATOR_READING_DIR_BASE = \"reading\"\n\n#### Map Settings\n\nVenues can have their location displayed on a map and, in the Admin, have their location set by clicking on a map. You can use either Google or Mapbox maps, both of which require an API key.\n\nTo use Google, get a [Google Maps JavaScript API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and create a billing account. Then set `SPECTATOR_MAPS` to this:\n\n    SPECTATOR_MAPS = {\n        \"enable\": True,\n        \"library\": \"google\",\n        \"tile_style\": \"roadmap\",\n        \"api_key\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\"\n    }\n\nThe `tile_style` value can be one of the basic [map styles](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/maptypes).\n\nTo use [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) sign up and get an API key for [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). Then set `SPECTATOR_MAPS` to this:\n\n    SPECTATOR_MAPS = {\n        \"enable\": True,\n        \"library\": \"mapbox\",\n        \"tile_style\": \"mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11\",\n        \"api_key\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\"\n    }\nThe `tile_style` value can be one of the pre-defined map styles, [listed under options.styles](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map).\n\nSetting `\"enable\"` to `False` in the above dicts will prevent maps appearing.\n\n#### Slug settings\n\nURLs for all objects include automatically-generated slugs, which are based on [Hashids](<http://hashids.org>) of the object's ID. You can change which characters are used in these slugs with this setting. e.g.:\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_ALPHABET = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890\"\n\nYou can also change the salt value used to encode the slugs. While the slugs don't provide complete security (i.e. it's not impossible to determine the ID on which a slug is based), using your own salt value can't hurt. e.g.:\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_SALT = \"My special salt value is here\"\n\n#### Date settings\n\nYou can change the format used for the dates of Events and for the titles of some sidebar cards in templates, using [strftime](http://strftime.org) formatting:\n\n    SPECTATOR_DATE_FORMAT = \"%Y-%m-%d\"\n\n#### Thumbnail settings\n\nThere are two sizes of thumbnail images used throughout the site and admin pages: those used on \"detail\" pages (e.g. showing information about a single publication) and those used on \"list\" pages (e.g. listing many Publications). Each thumbnail's maximum size is defined as a tuple of width and height. The original image will be resized to fit within these limits, without being cropped. To make them both bigger than the default you might use:\n\n    SPECTATOR_THUMBNAIL_DETAIL_SIZE = (400, 400)\n\n    SPECTATOR_THUMBNAIL_LIST_SIZE = (150, 200)\n\nWhen images are uploaded for Publications and Events (see below), they are stored within named directories within your Django project's `MEDIA_ROOT`. e.g. a Publication with a `slug` of `pzov6` would have its cover uploaded to a path like `/media/reading/publications/pzov6/my_cover.jpg`. The `reading` part is defined by the `SPECTATOR_READING_DIR_BASE` setting. You could change the defaults like this:\n\n    SPECTATOR_EVENTS_DIR_BASE = \"my-events\"\n\n    SPECTATOR_READING_DIR_BASE = \"my-reading\"\n\n## 2. Overview\n\nThere are two main parts to Spectator: Reading and Events (movies, gigs, etc). They both share Creators.\n\n### Creators\n\nCreators are the authors of books, directors of movies, actors in plays, groups who perfom at gigs, etc.\n\nA Creator has a name and a `kind`, of either \"individual\" (e.g. \"Anthony Sher\") or \"group\" (e.g. \"Royal Shakespeare Company\").\n\nA Creator is associated with books, movies, events, etc. through roles, which include an optional `role_name` such as \"Author\", \"Illustrator\", \"Director\", \"Playwright\", \"Company\", etc. The roles can be given an order so that the creators of a thing will be listed in the appropriate order (such as the director before a movie's actors).\n\nSee [spectator/models/core.py](https://github.com/philgyford/django-spectator/blob/main/spectator/core/models.py) for these models.\n\n### Reading\n\nA Publication is a thing that's been read, and has a `kind` of either \"book\" or \"periodical\". A Publication can optionally be part of a PublicationSeries. e.g. a Publication \"Vol. 3 No. 7 September 2005\" could be part of the \"The Believer\" PublicationSeries.\n\nA Publication can have zero or more Readings. A Reading can have a `start_date` and `end_date`. If the `start_date` is set but the `end_date` isn't, the Publication is currently being read. When a Reading has been completed, and an `end_date` added, it can be marked as `is_finished` or not. If not, it's because you gave up on the Publication before getting to the end.\n\nBoth `start_date` and `end_date` indicates a specific day by default. If you don't know the day, or the month, a granularity can be specified indicating whether the reading started/ended sometime during the month or year.\n\nSee [spectator/reading/models.py](https://github.com/philgyford/django-spectator/blob/main/spectator/reading/models.py) for these models.\n\n### Events\n\nAn Event specifies a date on which you saw a thing at a particular Venue.\n\nA Venue has a name and, optionally, location details.\n\nEach Event can have zero or more Creators associated directly with it. e.g. the performers at a gig, the comedians at a comedy event. These can be in a specific order, and each with an optional role. e.g:\n\n- The Wedding Present\n  - Role: \"Headliner\"\n  - Order: 1\n- Buffalo Tom\n  - Role: \"Support\"\n  -  Order: 2\n\nEvents can be different kinds, e.g. \"gig\", \"cinema\", \"theatre\". This is only used for categorising Events into different lists - it doesn't restrict the kinds of Works that can be associated with it. You could have a \"cinema\" Event that has a movie, play and dance piece associated with it.\n\nEach Event can have zero or more Works associated with it: movies, plays, classical works or dance pieces. Each Work can have zero or more Creators, each with optional roles, associated directly with it. e.g. \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Composer)\", \"William Shakespeare (Playwright)\" or \"Steven Spielberg (Director)\":\n\nEvents can be given an optional title (e.g. \"Glastonbury Festival\"). If a title isn't specified one is created automatically when needed, based on any Works associated with it, or else any Creators associated with it.\n\nSee [spectator/events/models.py](https://github.com/philgyford/django-spectator/blob/main/spectator/events/models.py) for these models.\n\nThere is a Django management command (`generate_letterboxd_export`) that will generate a CSV file of movies seen (Works of kind \"movie\") suitable for importing into a Letterboxd.com account.\n\n## 3. Template tags\n\nEach app, core, events and reading, has some template tags.\n\n### Core template tags\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first:\n\n    {% load spectator_core %}\n\n#### Most Read Creators\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Creators with the most Readings associated with them:\n\n    {% most_read_creators num=10 %}\n\nEach Creator will have a `num_readings` attribute. It will only include Creators whose role on a publication was \"Author\" or was left blank. i.e. Creators who were \"Illustrator\" or \"Translator\" will not be included.\n\nTo display this as a chart in a Bootstrap card:\n\n    {% most_read_creators_card num=10 %}\n\nThis will exclude any Creators with only 1 Reading.\n\n#### Most Visited Venues\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Venues with the most Events associated with them:\n\n    {% most_visited_venues num=10 %}\n\nEach Venue will have a `num_visits` attribute.\n\nTo display this as a chart in a Bootstrap card:\n\n    {% most_visited_venues_card num=10 %}\n\nThis will exclude any Venues with only 1 Event.\n\n### Reading template tags\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first:\n\n    {% load spectator_reading %}\n\n#### In-progress Publications\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications currently being read use `in_progress_publications`:\n\n    {% in_progress_publications as publications %}\n\n    {% for pub in publications %}\n      <p>{{ pub }}<br>\n        {% for role in pub.roles.all %}\n          {{ role.creator.name }}\n          {% if role.role_name %}({{ role.role_name }}){% endif %}\n          <br>\n        {% endfor %}\n      </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card:\n\n    {% in_progress_publications_card %}\n\n#### Publications being read on a day\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications that were being read on a particular day use `day_publications`. If `my_date` is a python `date` object:\n\n    {% day_publications date=my_date as publications %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card:\n\n    {% day_publications_card date=my_date %}\n\n#### Years of reading\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Publications were being read:\n\n    {% reading_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n      {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card, with each year linking to the `ReadingYearArchiveView`:\n\n    {% reading_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, `year` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\n#### Annual reading counts\n\nFor more detail than the `reading_years` tag, use this to get the number of Books, and Periodicals (and the total) finished per year:\n\n    {% annual_reading_counts as years %}\n\n    {% for year_data in years %}\n      {{ year_data.year }}:\n      {{ year_data.book }} book(s),\n      {{ year_data.periodical }} periodical(s),\n      {{ year_data.total }} total.<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card, with each year linking to `ReadingYearArchiveView`:\n\n    {% annual_reading_counts_card current_year=year kind='all' %}\n\nHere, `year` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\nAnd `kind` can be one of \"all\" (default), \"book\" or \"periodical\". If it's \"all\", then the result is rendered as a table, with a column each for year, book count, periodical count and total count. Otherwise it's a list of years with the book/periodical counts in parentheses.\n\n### Events template tags\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first:\n\n    {% load spectator_events %}\n\n#### Recent Events\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened recently:\n\n    {% recent_events num=3 as events %}\n\n    {% for event in events %}\n      <p>\n        {{ event }}<br>\n        {{ event.venue.name }}\n      </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nIf `num` is not specified, 10 are returned by default.\n\nOr to display as a Boostrap card:\n\n    {% recent_events_card num=3 %}\n\n#### Events on a day\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened on a particular day, use `day_events`. If `my_date` is a python `date` object:\n\n    {% day_events date=my_date as events %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card:\n\n    {% day_events_card date=my_date %}\n\n#### Years of Events\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Events happened:\n\n    {% events_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n      {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card, with each year linking to the `EventYearArchiveView`:\n\n    {% events_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, `year` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\n#### Annual Event Counts\n\nTo include counts of Events per year:\n\n    {% annual_event_counts as years %}\n\n    {% for year_data in years %}\n      {{ year_data.year|date:\"Y\" }}: {{ year_data.total }} event(s)<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nRestrict to one kind of Event:\n\n    {% annual_event_counts kind='cinema' as years %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap 4 card, with each year linking to `EventYearArchiveView`:\n\n    {% annual_event_counts_card current_year=year kind='all' %}\n\nHere, `year` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\n#### Most Seen Creators\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Creators involved with the most Events:\n\n    {% most_seen_creators num=10 event_kind='gig' %}\n\nEach Creator will have a `num_events` attribute.\n\n`event_kind` can be omitted, or be `None` to include all kinds of Event.\n\nTo display this as a chart in a Bootstrap card:\n\n    {% most_seen_creators_card num=10 event_kind='gig' %}\n\nThis will exclude any Creators with only 1 Event.\n\n#### Creators With Most Works\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Creators that have the most Works (e.g, movies, plays, etc):\n\n    {% most_seen_creators_by_works num=10 work_kind='movie', role_name='Director' %}\n\nEach Creator will have a `num_works` attribute.\n\n`work_kind` can be omitted and all kinds of Work will be counted.\n\n`role_name` can be omitted and all roles will be counted.\n\nThe above example would, for each Creator, only count movie Works on which their role was 'Director'.\n\nTo display this as a chart in a Bootstrap card:\n\n    {% most_seen_creators_by_works_card num=10 work_kind='movie', role_name='Director' %}\n\nThis will exclude any Creators with only 1 Work.\n\n#### Most Seen Works\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Works involved with the most Events:\n\n    {% most_seen_works num=10 kind='movie' %}\n\nEach Work will have a `num_views` attribute.\n\n`kind` can be omitted, or be `None` to include all kinds of Work.\n\nTo display this as a chart in a Bootstrap card:\n\n    {% most_seen_works_card num=10 kind='movie' %}\n\nThis will exclude any Works with only 1 Event.\n\n## 4. Local development\n\n`devproject/` is a basic Django project to use the app locally.\n\nI set things up locally, having installed virtualenv and pyenv, like this:\n\n    $ cd devproject\n    $ virtualenv --prompt spectator-devproject venv\n    $ source venv/bin/activate\n    (spectator-devproject)$ pyenv local 3.10.5\n    (spectator-devproject)$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThen run migrations and start the server:\n\n    (spectator-devproject)$ ./manage.py migrate\n    (spectator-devproject)$ ./manage.py runserver\n\n### Environment variables\n\nYou can add a `.env` file in `devproject/` and its environment variables will be\nread in `devproject/devproject/settings.py`. e.g.:\n\n  SPECTATOR_MAPBOX_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n  DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=\"your-secret-key\"\n  DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=\"INFO\"\n\n### pre-commit\n\npre-commit will run flake8, black, isort and prettier across all files on commit.\nI think you just need to do this first:\n\n  $ pre-commit install\n\n### Running tests locally\n\nRun tests with tox, from the top-level directory (containing setup.py). Install it with:\n\n    $ pip install tox\n\nRun all tests in all environments like:\n\n    $ tox\n\nTo run tests in only one environment, specify it. In this case, Python 3.8 and Django 3.2:\n\n    $ tox -e py38-django32\n\nTo run a specific test, add its path after `--`, eg:\n\n    $ tox -e py38-django32 -- tests.core.test\\_models.CreatorTestCase.test\\_ordering\n\nRunning the tests in all environments will generate coverage output. There will also be an `htmlcov/` directory containing an HTML report. You can also generate these reports without running all the other tests:\n\n    $ tox -e coverage\n\n### Making a new release\n\nSo I don't forget...\n\n1. Put new changes on `main`.\n2. Update the `__version__` in `spectator.__init__.py`.\n3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.\n4. Do `python setup.py tag`.\n5. Do `python setup.py publish`.\n\n### Adding a new Event kind\n\nIf it's simple (like, Gigs, Comedy, etc.) and doesn't require any specific kind of Works, then:\n\n- In `spectator.events.models.Event` add it in `Kind` and `Kind.slugs()`.\n- Possibly add a special case for it in `Event.get_kind_name_plural()`.\n- Add a simple factory for it in `spectator.events.factories`.\n- In `tests.events.test_models.EventTestCase`:\n  - Add it to:\n    - `test_get_kind()`\n    - `test_valid_kind_slugs()`\n    - `test_kind_slug()`\n    - `test_kind_name()`\n    - `test_kind_name_plural()`\n    - `test_get_kinds_data()`\n  - Add a `test_absolute_url_*()` test for this kind.\n\n### Adding a new Work kind\n\n- In `spectator.events.models.Work` add it in `Kind` and `Kind.slugs()`.\n- On the `Event` model add a new method similar to `get_classical_works()` for this new kind of `Work`.\n- On the `spectator.core.models.Creator` model add a new method similar to `get_classical_works()` for this new kind of `Work`.\n- Add a simple factory for it in `spectator.events.factories`.\n- In `spectator/events/templates/spectator_events/event_detail.html` add an include to list the works.\n- In `spectator/core/templates/spectator_core/creator_detail.html` add an include to list the works.\n- In `tests/` add equivalents of:\n  - `core.test_models.CreatorTestCase.test.get_classical_works()`\n  - `events.test_models.EventTestCase.test_get_classical_works()`\n  - `events.test_models.WorkTestCase.test_absolute_url_classicalwork()`\n  - `events.test_models.WorkTestCase.test_get_list_url_classicalwork()`\n\n## 5.
