    "description": "==================\n Django Spectator\n==================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/philgyford/django-spectator.svg?branch=master\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/philgyford/django-spectator?branch=master\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/philgyford/django-spectator/badge.svg?branch=master\n  :target: https://coveralls.io/github/philgyford/django-spectator?branch=master\n\nTwo Django apps:\n\n* One to track book and periodical reading, including start and end dates, authors.\n* One to track events attended (movie, plays, gigs, exhibitions, comedy, dance,\n  classical), including date, venue, and people/organisations involved.\n\nSo far only used with Python 3.6 and Django 1.10 or 1.11. Should work with\nPython 3.5+ and Django 1.8+.\n\nIt has URLs, views and templates to create a site displaying all the data, and\nDjango admin screens to add and edit them. The templates use `Bootstrap v4-alpha.6 <https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com>`_.\n\nThere are also template tags for displaying data in your own templates (see\nbelow).\n\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\nInstall with pip::\n\n    pip install django-spectator\n\nAdd the apps to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'spectator.core',\n        'spectator.events',\n        'spectator.reading',\n    ]\n\nWhile ``spectator.core`` is required, you can omit either ``spectator.events``\nor ``spectator.reading`` if you only want to use one of them.\n\nRun migrations::\n\n    ./manage.py makemigrations\n\nOptionally get a `Google Maps JavaScript API key <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key>`_ and add it to your ``settings.py`` like this::\n\n    SPECTATOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY'\n\nThis will enable using a map in the Django Admin to set the location of Venues,\nand the displaying of Venues' maps in the public templates.\n\nThen, go to Django Admin to add your data.\n\n\n********\nOverview\n********\n\nThere are two main parts to Spectator: Reading and Events (movies, gigs, etc). They both share Creators.\n\nCreators\n========\n\nCreators are the authors of books, directors of movies, actors in plays, groups who perfom at gigs, etc.\n\nA Creator has a name and a ``kind``, of either \"individual\" (e.g. \"Anthony Sher\") or \"group\" (e.g. \"Royal Shakespeare Company\").\n\nA Creator is associated with books, movies, events, etc. through roles, which\ninclude an optional ``role_name`` such as \"Author\", \"Illustrator\", \"Director\",\n\"Playwright\", \"Company\", etc. The roles can be given an order so that the\ncreators of a thing will be listed in the appropriate order (such as the\ndirector before a movie's actors).\n\nSee ``spectator/models/core.py`` for these models.\n\nReading\n=======\n\nA Publication is a thing that's been read, and has a ``kind`` of either \"book\"\nor \"periodical\". A Publication can optionally be part of a PublicationSeries.\ne.g. a Publication \"Vol. 3 No. 7 September 2005\" could be part of the \"The\nBeliever\" PublicationSeries.\n\nA Publication can have zero or more Readings. A Reading can have\na ``start_date`` and ``end_date``. If the ``start_date`` is set but the\n``end_date`` isn't, the Publication is currently being read. When a Reading has\nbeen completed, and an ``end_date`` added, it can be marked as ``is_finished``\nor not. If not, it's because you gave up on the Publication before getting to\nthe end.\n\nBoth ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` indicates a specific day by default. If\nyou don't know the day, or the month, a granularity can be specified indicating\nwhether the reading started/ended sometime during the month or year.\n\nSee ``spectator/models/reading.py`` for these models.\n\nEvents\n======\n\nAn Event specifies a date on which you saw a thing at a particular Venue.\nA Venue has a name and, optionally, location details. Events can be different\nkinds, e.g. \"gig\", \"movie\", \"play\".\n\nWhile an Event is a thing at a place on a day, with some optional Creators,\nsome kinds of Events are slightly more complicated.\n\nGigs, Comedy, Exhibitions and Other \n-----------------------------------\n\nEvents of kind \"gig\", \"comedy\", \"exhibition\" and \"misc\" are the simplest. A\ndate when you went to a Venue to see one or more Creators. The Event can\noptionally have a title. \"Other\" is for events that don't fit into one of the\nother kinds.\n\nPlays\n-----\n\nAn Event of kind \"play\" can have one Play object (e.g. \"King Lear\") connected to\nit. A Play is created by (optionally) one or more Creators (e.g. \"William \nShakespeare (Playwright)\"). A Play can therefore have several Events (occasions\nwhen you saw that one play), with its own Creators (e.g. \"Anthony Sher \n(Actor)\").\n\nMovies\n------\n\nAn Event of kind \"movie\" can have one Movie object connected to it. A Movie is\ncreated by (optionally) one or more Creators. It can optionally have a year and\nan IMDb ID. A Movie can therefore have several Events (occasions when you saw\nthat one film). Although you could add Creators to the Event itself, that\nprobably doesn't make sense usually, unless, there was a post-screening\ninterview or something.\n\nClassical concert\n-----------------\n\nAn Event of kind \"concert\" is when one *or more* Classical Works were \nseen/heard. A Classical Work can have zero or more Creators (e.g. \"Wolfgang\nAmadeus Mozart (Composer)\"). The Event itself can also have zero or more\nCreators (e.g. \"Ian Page (Conductor)\").\n\nDance\n-----\n\nAn Event of kind \"dance\" is when one *or more* Dance Pieces were seen. A Dance\nPiece can have zero or more Creators (e.g. \"Pina Bausch (Choreographer)\"). The\nEvent itself can also have zero or more Creators (e.g. \"English National\nBallet\").\n\n\n*************\nTemplate tags\n*************\n\nEach app, `core`, `events` and `reading`, has some template tags.\n\nEvents template tags\n====================\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first::\n\n    {% load spectator_events %}\n\nRecent Events\n-------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened recently::\n\n    {% recent_events num=3 as events %}\n\n    {% for event in events %}\n        <p>\n            {{ event }}<br>\n            {{ event.venue.name }}\n        </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nIf ``num`` is not specified, 10 are returned by default.\n\nOr to display as a Boostrap card::\n\n    {% recent_events_card num=3 %}\n\nEvents on a day\n---------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened on a particular day, use\n``day_events``. If ``my_date`` is a python ``date`` object::\n\n    {% day_events date=my_date as events %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% day_events_card date=my_date %}\n\nYears of Events\n---------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Events happened::\n\n    {% events_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n        {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card, with each year linking to the\n``EventYearArchiveView``::\n\n    {% events_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, ``year`` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\nReading template tags\n=====================\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first::\n\n    {% load spectator_reading %}\n\nIn-progress Publications\n------------------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications currently being read use\n``in_progress_publications``::\n\n    {% in_progress_publications as publications %}\n\n    {% for pub in publications %}\n        <p>{{ pub }}<br>\n        {% for role in pub.roles.all %}\n            {{ role.creator.name }}\n            {% if role.role_name %}({{ role.role_name }}){% endif %}\n            <br>\n        {% endfor %}\n        </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% in_progress_publications_card %}\n\nPublications being read on a day\n--------------------------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications that were being read on a particular day use\n``day_publications``. If ``my_date`` is a python ``date`` object::\n\n    {% day_publications date=my_date as publications %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% day_publications_card date=my_date %}\n\nYears of reading\n----------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Publications were being read::\n\n    {% reading_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n        {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card, with each year linking to the\n``ReadingYearArchiveView``::\n\n    {% reading_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, ``year`` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\n\n*****************\nLocal development\n*****************\n\n``devproject/`` is a basic Django project to use the app locally. Use it like::\n\n$ pip install -r devproject/requirements.txt\n$ python setup.py develop\n$ ./devproject/manage.py migrate\n$ ./devproject/manage.py runserver\n\nRun tests with tox. Install it with::\n\n$ pip install tox\n\nRun all tests in all environments like::\n\n$ tox\n\nTo run tests in only one environment, specify it. In this case, Python 3.6 and Django 1.11::\n\n$ tox -e py36-django111\n\nTo run a specific test, add its path after ``--``, eg::\n\n$ tox -e py36-django111 -- tests.core.test_models.CreatorTestCase.test_ordering\n\nRunning the tests in all environments will generate coverage output. There will also be an ``htmlcov/`` directory containing an HTML report. You can also generate these reports without running all the other tests::\n\n$ tox -e coverage\n\nAdding a new event type\n=======================\n\nIf it's simple (like, Gigs, Comedy, etc.) and doesn't require extra models,\nthen:\n\n* In ``spectator.events.models.Event`` add it in ``KIND_CHOICES`` and ``KIND_SLUGS``.\n* Possibly add a special case for it in ``Event.get_kind_name_plural()``.\n* Add a simple factory for it in ``spectator.events.factories``.\n* In ``tests.events.test_models.EventTestCase``:\n    * Add it to:\n        * ``test_get_kind()``\n        * ``test_valid_kind_slugs()``\n        * ``test_kind_slug()``\n        * ``test_kind_name()``\n        * ``test_kind_name_plural()``\n        * ``test_get_kinds_data()``\n    * Add a ``test_absolute_url_*()`` test for this kind.\n\nIf it involves an extra model (like Movies and Plays do) then also:\n\n* Create the new model in ``spectator.events.models`` with a matching Role\n  model (like ``MovieRole``).\n* Associate the new model by ``ForeignKey`` to the ``Event`` model.\n* Add a special case for it in ``Event.get_absolute_url()``.\n* Add a special case for it in ``Event.__str__()``.\n* Add its Admin in ``spectator.events.admin``.\n* Add any validation needed to ``spectator.events.admin.EventAdminForm``.\n* Add new URLs for the model's List and Detail views in\n  ``spectator.events.urls`` (and add tests).\n* Add the new List and Detail views in ``spectator.events.views``.\n* In ``spectator.events.views.EventDetailView.get_queryset()`` add a section to\n  adjust the queryset for this model.\n* Add templates in ``spectator/events/templates/events/`` for its List and\n  Detail views.\n* In ``spectator/core/templates/core/creator_detail.html`` add a section to\n  list the new models for a Creator.\n\nIf it involves several extra models (like Dance and Concert events do) then\nit's similar to above but absolute URLs are different; see the code for\nexamples of those.\n\n* Instead of adding the new modely by ``ForeignKey``, it's\n  a ``ManyToManyField``.\n* It doesn't have a special case in ``Event.get_absolute_url()``.\n* Add URLs and Views for the List and Detail views for the new model\n  (e.g. DancePiece).\n* Add the ``get_absolute_url()`` method for that new model.\n* Add the display of its works (e.g. DancePieces) in ``spectator/events/templates/events/event_detail.html``.\n\n\n*******\nContact\n*******\n\nPhil Gyford\nphil@gyford.com\n@philgyford on Twitter\n\n\n",
