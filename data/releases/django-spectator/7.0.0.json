    "description": "==================\n Django Spectator\n==================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/philgyford/django-spectator.svg?branch=master\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/philgyford/django-spectator?branch=master\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/philgyford/django-spectator/badge.svg?branch=master\n  :target: https://coveralls.io/github/philgyford/django-spectator?branch=master\n\nTwo Django apps:\n\n* One to track book and periodical reading, including start and end dates, authors.\n* One to track events attended (movie, plays, gigs, exhibitions, comedy, dance,\n  classical), including date, venue, and people/organisations involved.\n\nFor Django 1.11 or Django 2.0 running on Python 3.5 or 3.6.\n\nIt has URLs, views and templates to create a site displaying all the data, and\nDjango admin screens to add and edit them. The templates use `Bootstrap v4-beta <https://getbootstrap.com>`_.\n\nThere are also template tags for displaying data in your own templates (see\nbelow).\n\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\nInstall with pip::\n\n    pip install django-spectator\n\nAdd the apps to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'spectator.core',\n        'spectator.events',\n        'spectator.reading',\n    ]\n\nWhile ``spectator.core`` is required, you can omit either ``spectator.events``\nor ``spectator.reading`` if you only want to use one of them.\n\nRun migrations::\n\n    ./manage.py migrate\n\nAdd to your project's ``urls.py``::\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        # ...\n\n        url(r'^spectator/', include('spectator.core.urls')),\n    ]\n\nYou can change the initial path (``r'^spectator/'``) to whatever suits you. e.g.\nuse ``r'^'`` to have Spectator's home page be the front page of your site.\n\nThen, go to Django Admin to add your data.\n\n\nSettings\n========\n\nOptionally get a `Google Maps JavaScript API key <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key>`_ and add it to your ``settings.py`` like this::\n\n    SPECTATOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY'\n\nThis will enable using a map in the Django Admin to set the location of Venues,\nand the displaying of Venues' maps in the public templates.\n\nURLs for all objects include automatically-generated slugs, which are based on\n[Hashids](http://hashids.org) of the object's ID. You can change which\ncharacters are used in these slugs with this setting::\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_ALPHABET = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890'\n\nThe default is ``'abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz23456789'``.\n\nYou can also change the salt value used to encode the slugs. While the slugs\ndon't provide complete security (i.e. it's not impossible to determine the ID on\nwhich a slug is based), using your own salt value can't hurt::\n\n    SPECTATOR_SLUG_SALT = 'My special salt value is here'\n\nThe default is ``'Django Spectator'``.\n\n\n********\nOverview\n********\n\nThere are two main parts to Spectator: Reading and Events (movies, gigs, etc). They both share Creators.\n\nCreators\n========\n\nCreators are the authors of books, directors of movies, actors in plays, groups who perfom at gigs, etc.\n\nA Creator has a name and a ``kind``, of either \"individual\" (e.g. \"Anthony Sher\") or \"group\" (e.g. \"Royal Shakespeare Company\").\n\nA Creator is associated with books, movies, events, etc. through roles, which\ninclude an optional ``role_name`` such as \"Author\", \"Illustrator\", \"Director\",\n\"Playwright\", \"Company\", etc. The roles can be given an order so that the\ncreators of a thing will be listed in the appropriate order (such as the\ndirector before a movie's actors).\n\nSee ``spectator/models/core.py`` for these models.\n\nReading\n=======\n\nA Publication is a thing that's been read, and has a ``kind`` of either \"book\"\nor \"periodical\". A Publication can optionally be part of a PublicationSeries.\ne.g. a Publication \"Vol. 3 No. 7 September 2005\" could be part of the \"The\nBeliever\" PublicationSeries.\n\nA Publication can have zero or more Readings. A Reading can have\na ``start_date`` and ``end_date``. If the ``start_date`` is set but the\n``end_date`` isn't, the Publication is currently being read. When a Reading has\nbeen completed, and an ``end_date`` added, it can be marked as ``is_finished``\nor not. If not, it's because you gave up on the Publication before getting to\nthe end.\n\nBoth ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` indicates a specific day by default. If\nyou don't know the day, or the month, a granularity can be specified indicating\nwhether the reading started/ended sometime during the month or year.\n\nSee ``spectator/models/reading.py`` for these models.\n\nEvents\n======\n\nAn Event specifies a date on which you saw a thing at a particular Venue.\n\nA Venue has a name and, optionally, location details.\n\nEach Event can have zero or more Creators associated directly with it. e.g. the\nperformers at a gig, the comedians at a comedy event. These can be in a spectific\norder, and each with an optional role. e.g:\n\n* The Wedding Present\n    * Role: Headliner\n    * Order: 1\n* Buffalo Tom\n    * Role: Support\n    * Order: 2\n\nEvents can be different kinds, e.g. \"gig\", \"movie\", \"play\".\n\nEach Event can have zero or more works associated with it, of four different\ntypes. Each can have zero or more Creators, each with optional roles, associated\ndirectly with it. e.g. \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Composer)\", \"William\nShakespeare (Playwright)\" or \"Steven Spielberg (Director)\":\n\n* Classical work\n* Dance piece\n* Movie (can also have a year of release and an IMDb ID associated with it)\n* Play\n\nAlthough Events are specified as being of a certain kind (\"gig\", \"movie\", etc)\nthis does not affect the kinds of work that are associated with it. e.g. you\ncould create a \"play\" Event and say that one or more movies were shown there.The\nEvent kinds are used to produce different lists (e.g. all the movie events).\n\nEvents can be given an optional title (e.g. \"Glastonbury Festival\"). If a title\nisn't specified one is created automatically when needed, based on any works\n(movies, plays, etc) associated with it, or else any Creators associated with\nit. When a title is automatically created, it only includes works relevant to\nthe Event's kind. e.g. A \"play\" Event that featured two plays and, for some\nreason, a movie, would have a title displayed that only listed the plays.\n\n\n*************\nTemplate tags\n*************\n\nEach app, `core`, `events` and `reading`, has some template tags.\n\nEvents template tags\n====================\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first::\n\n    {% load spectator_events %}\n\nRecent Events\n-------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened recently::\n\n    {% recent_events num=3 as events %}\n\n    {% for event in events %}\n        <p>\n            {{ event }}<br>\n            {{ event.venue.name }}\n        </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nIf ``num`` is not specified, 10 are returned by default.\n\nOr to display as a Boostrap card::\n\n    {% recent_events_card num=3 %}\n\nEvents on a day\n---------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Events that happened on a particular day, use\n``day_events``. If ``my_date`` is a python ``date`` object::\n\n    {% day_events date=my_date as events %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% day_events_card date=my_date %}\n\nYears of Events\n---------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Events happened::\n\n    {% events_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n        {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card, with each year linking to the\n``EventYearArchiveView``::\n\n    {% events_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, ``year`` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\nReading template tags\n=====================\n\nTo use any of these in a template, first::\n\n    {% load spectator_reading %}\n\nIn-progress Publications\n------------------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications currently being read use\n``in_progress_publications``::\n\n    {% in_progress_publications as publications %}\n\n    {% for pub in publications %}\n        <p>{{ pub }}<br>\n        {% for role in pub.roles.all %}\n            {{ role.creator.name }}\n            {% if role.role_name %}({{ role.role_name }}){% endif %}\n            <br>\n        {% endfor %}\n        </p>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% in_progress_publications_card %}\n\nPublications being read on a day\n--------------------------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of Publications that were being read on a particular day use\n``day_publications``. If ``my_date`` is a python ``date`` object::\n\n    {% day_publications date=my_date as publications %}\n\nAnd display the results as in the above example.\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card::\n\n    {% day_publications_card date=my_date %}\n\nYears of reading\n----------------\n\nTo get a QuerySet of the years in which Publications were being read::\n\n    {% reading_years as years %}\n\n    {% for year in years %}\n        {{ year|date:\"Y\" }}<br>\n    {% endfor %}\n\nOr to display as a Bootstrap card, with each year linking to the\n``ReadingYearArchiveView``::\n\n    {% reading_years_card current_year=year %}\n\nHere, ``year`` is a date object indicating a year which shouldn't be linked.\n\n\n*****************\nLocal development\n*****************\n\n``devproject/`` is a basic Django project to use the app locally. Use it like::\n\n$ pip install -r devproject/requirements.txt\n$ python setup.py develop\n$ ./devproject/manage.py migrate\n$ ./devproject/manage.py runserver\n\nRun tests with tox. Install it with::\n\n$ pip install tox\n\nRun all tests in all environments like::\n\n$ tox\n\nTo run tests in only one environment, specify it. In this case, Python 3.6 and Django 2.0::\n\n$ tox -e py36-django20\n\nTo run a specific test, add its path after ``--``, eg::\n\n$ tox -e py36-django20 -- tests.core.test_models.CreatorTestCase.test_ordering\n\nRunning the tests in all environments will generate coverage output. There will also be an ``htmlcov/`` directory containing an HTML report. You can also generate these reports without running all the other tests::\n\n$ tox -e coverage\n\nMaking a new release\n====================\n\nSo I don't forget...\n\n1. Put new changes on ``master``.\n2. Update the ``__version__`` in ``spectator.__init__.py``.\n3. Update ``CHANGES.rst``.\n4. Do ``python setup.py tag``.\n5. Do ``python setup.py publish``.\n\n\nAdding a new event type\n=======================\n\nIf it's simple (like, Gigs, Comedy, etc.) and doesn't require extra models,\nthen:\n\n* In ``spectator.events.models.Event`` add it in ``KIND_CHOICES`` and ``KIND_SLUGS``.\n* Possibly add a special case for it in ``Event.get_kind_name_plural()``.\n* Add a simple factory for it in ``spectator.events.factories``.\n* In ``tests.events.test_models.EventTestCase``:\n    * Add it to:\n        * ``test_get_kind()``\n        * ``test_valid_kind_slugs()``\n        * ``test_kind_slug()``\n        * ``test_kind_name()``\n        * ``test_kind_name_plural()``\n        * ``test_get_kinds_data()``\n    * Add a ``test_absolute_url_*()`` test for this kind.\n\nIf it involves an extra model (like Movies and Concerts do) then also:\n\n* Create the new model in ``spectator.events.models`` that inherits from the\n  ``Work`` model (like ``Movie``).\n* Create a matching role model, (like ``MovieRole``).\n* Create a matching selection model, (like ``MovieSelection``).\n* Associate the new model by a ``ManyToManyField``, through the selection model,\n  to the ``Event`` model (like ``Event.movies``).\n* In ``spectator.events.admin`` add the Inlines for the role and selection\n  models, and include them in the ``EventAdmin``.\n* Add new URLs for the model's List and Detail views in\n  ``spectator.events.urls`` (and add tests).\n* Add the new List and Detail views in ``spectator.events.views``.\n* If necessary, add templates in ``spectator/events/templates/events/`` for its\n  List and Detail views. This is only necessary if your new work has special\n  requirements, like Movies do (with their years and IMDb IDs). Otherwise the\n  generic ``m2m_work_*.html`` templates can be used).\n* In ``spectator/events/templates/event_detail.html`` add an include to list the\n  works.\n* In ``spectator/core/templates/core/creator_detail.html`` add a section to\n  list the new models for a Creator.\n\nIf it involves several extra models (like Dance and Concert events do) then\nit's similar to above but absolute URLs are different; see the code for\nexamples of those.\n\n\n*******\nContact\n*******\n\n* Phil Gyford\n* phil@gyford.com\n* @philgyford on Twitter\n",
