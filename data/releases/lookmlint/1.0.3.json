    "description": "# lookmlint\n\nLint your LookML.\n\nProvides additional linting checks beyond what is built into the LookML Validator.\n\n\n## usage\n\nFrom the CLI:\n\n```\n$ lookmlint lint ~/my-lookml-repo\n```\n\nFor structured output, set the `--json` flag:\n\n```\n$ lookmlint lint ~/my-lookml-repo --json\n```\n\n### configuration\n\n`lookmlint` looks for a file named `.lintconfig.yml` in your lookML project repo.\n\nIts contents can contain lists of abbreviations and/or acronyms you'd like to flag, as well as any checks you'd like to run. More detail below.\n\n#### sample .lintconfig.yml\n\n```yml\nabbreviations:\n  - num\n  - qty\nacronyms:\n  - aov\n  - sms\n  - sku\n  - sla\ntimeframes:\n  - date\n  - month\n  - month_name\n  - time\n  - year\nchecks:\n  - label-issues\n  - unused-includes\n  - unused-view-files\n  - mismatched-view-names\n  - semicolons-in-derived-table-sql\n  - missing-view-sql-definitions\n  - raw-sql-in-joins\n```\n\n## installation\n\nRequires `python3`.\n\n```\n$ pip install lookmlint\n```\n\n## checks\n\n### `label-issues`\n\n#### acronyms\n\nLookML automatically converts snake case strings (e.g. `unit_cost_usd`) to title case (e.g. `Unit Cost Usd`), which looks funny when using acronyms. Leverages the list of acronyms defined in `.lintconfig.yml`.\n\n**Bad**\n\n```\ndimension: unit_cost_usd {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Good**\n\n```\ndimension: unit_cost_usd {\n    label: \"Unit Cost (USD)\"\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n#### abbreviations\n\nIf you'd prefer some words fully spelled out (e.g. 'Quantity' instead of 'Qty'), define a list of abbreviations for `lookmlint` to catch.\n\n\n### `raw-sql-in-joins`\n\nJoins should refer to LookML dimensions as opposed to the underlying fields where possible.\n\nFor example:\n\n**Bad**\n\n```\njoin: order_items {\n  sql_on: orders.id = order_items.order_id ;;\n}\n```\n\n**Good**\n\n```\njoin: order_items {\n  sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${order_items.order_id} ;;\n}\n```\n\n### `missing-timeframes`\n\nFind all date/datetime/time dimensions or dimension groups that are missing any of the timeframes defined in `.lintconfig.yml`.\n\n\n### `unused-includes`\n\nIf your LookML model explicitly specifies views to include, `lookmlint` can catch views that are `include`d in your model but not referenced in any of the explorations in that model.\n\n### `unused-view-files`\n\nFind all view files that aren't referenced in any explorations in your project.\n\n### `views-missing-primary-keys`\n\nFind all view files that don't contain a `primary_key` dimension.\n\n### `duplicate-view-labels`\n\nFind any cases when two `join`s in an exploration end up with the same label.\n\nOne way this can unwittingly creep into code is if a `label` is defined in a view file, that view is joined twice to the same exploration, but `view_label`s are not assigned to those joins.\n\n### `missing-view-sql-definitions`\n\nFind any views that do not have a `sql_table_name` or `derived_table` value set.\n\n### `semicolons-in-derived-table-sql`\n\nFind any derived table SQL expressions that contain a rogue semicolon, which will throw errors at query time.\n\n### `mismatched-view-names`\n\nFind any views where the view name does not match the view filename.\n\n## examples\n\nThe sample repo at `examples/sample_repo/` contains instances of all linting violations:\n\n\n```\n~/src/lookmlint $$$ lookmlint lint examples/sample_repo/\nError:\n\n\nduplicate-view-labels\n---------------------\nModel: test\n  Explore: inventory_transfers\n    Inventory Locations: 2\n\n\nlabel-issues\n------------\nFields:\n  View: order_items\n    - Qty: ['Qty']\n    - Unit Cost Usd: ['USD']\n\n\nmissing-timeframes\n-----------\nView: items\n  Field: Created\n   - Missing Timeframe(s): ['month_name', 'time']\nView: orders\n  Field: Placed\n   - Missing Timeframe(s): ['date', 'month', 'month_name', 'time', 'year']\n\n\nmismatched-view-names\n---------------------\n- items.view.lkml: order_items\n\n\nmissing-view-sql-definitions\n----------------------------\n- order_items\n\n\nraw-sql-in-joins\n----------------\nModel: test\n  Explore: orders\n    order_items: orders.id = order_items.order_id\n\n\nsemicolons-in-derived-table-sql\n-------------------------------\n- products\n\n\nunused-includes\n---------------\nModel: test\n  - web_sessions\n\n\nunused-view-files\n-----------------\n- legacy_products\n- web_sessions\n\n\nviews-missing-primary-keys\n--------------------------\n- order_items\n```\n\n## adding to CircleCI\n\nWe use CircleCI at Warby Parker to run our checks.\n\nAdding the following contents to `.circleci/config.yml` in your LookML project should work for running linting as part of your CI/CD workflow. This all runs in a few seconds, but leveraging caching could also help to speed things up.\n\nCustomize the list of checks you run to suit your team's needs, or leave out the `--checks` flag to run all possible lint checks.\n\n```\nversion: 2\njobs:\n  build:\n    docker:\n      - image: circleci/python:3.6.2-stretch\n    working_directory: ~/repo\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n      - run:\n          name: Install lookmlint\n          command: |\n            sudo pip install lookmlint\n      - run:\n          name: Lint lookml\n          command: |\n            lookmlint lint . --checks label-issues,unused-includes,unused-view-files,mismatched-view-names,semicolons-in-derived-table-sql,missing-view-sql-definitions\n```\n\n\n## issues?\n\nThis repo is still in alpha, so use at your own risk!\n\nPlease open an issue for any feature suggestions or bugs, or feel free to open a PR with a fix / feature!\n\n\n",
