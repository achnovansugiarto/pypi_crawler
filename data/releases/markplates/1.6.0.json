This happens to me frequently when an editor makes a suggestion to an article that will modify the underlying code it is quoting.\n\n## Installing\n\nYou can download and install the latest version of MarkPlates from the PyPI with this command:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade markplates\n```\n\nMarkPlates is currently tested against Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.\n\n## Usage\n\nRunning `markplates` is as simple as handing it a file:\n\n```bash\n$ markplates template.mdt\n```\n\nThis will process the template in `template.mdt`, filling it in with data specified in the template.\n\nThe `examples` directory has the `simple.mdt` template:\n\n```markdown\n# Sample MarkPlates Template\n{{ set_path(\"./examples\") }}\n\nThis is an example of importing an entire file. Without a range specified, the first line is skipped to not include the shell specifier. Double blank lines are condensed into single lines:\n{{ import_source(\"testfile.py\") }}\n\nIf you want to include the shell specifier, you can include it explicitly in a range. This silly example imports some of the lines from the file, demonstrating different ranges. Note that the ranges are compiled into a single list, so over-lapping ranges are only shown once:\n{{ import_source(\"testfile.py\", [1, 5, \"2\", 3, \"8-$\", \"$\", \"$-2\"]) }}\n\nFunctions can be imported from a file by name:\n\n{{ import_function(\"testfile.py\", \"flying_pig_menu\") }}\n\nThe import_repl tag captures stdout and stderr from a REPL session:\n{{ import_repl(\n\"\"\"\ndef func(x):\n    if x:\n        print(x)\n\nfunc(True)\nfunc(False) \"\"\") }}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates setting the path and pulling in some of the lines of a file. You can also examine the `README.mdt` file in this library which is used to create this `README.md`.\n\nTo use on your own project create a markdown document with special tags to indicate a `markplates` function call.  The delimiter for these tags is `{{` function goes here `}}`.\n\n> **Note:** if you need to add `{{` characters which should not be processed as a template, you can put them in a `{{ '' }}`  block to escape them. Template processing is done with `Jinja2` so Markplates uses the same escape sequences.\n\n`Markplates` supports these functions:\n\n*  `set_path(\"path/to/source/files\")`\n* `import_source(\"source_file_name\", [list of line number ranges], language=None, filename=False)`\n* `import_function(\"source_file_name\", \"function_name\", language=None, filename=False)`\n* `import_repl(\"code to run in repl\")`\n\n### `set_path()`\n\nThe `set_path()` function allows you to specify the base directory to use when searching for source files.  Each call to this function will apply from that point in the template down.\n\nThe path must be included in single or double qoutes. If not specified, the path defaults to \".\", the current directory.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n```\n{{set_path(\".\")}}  #sets path to the default\n{{set_path(\"/home/user/my/project\")}} # points the path to your project\n```\n\nThe `set_path()` command is not required as all other functions will take full paths to files.\n\n### `import_source()`\n\nThe `import_source()` function will pull in the contents of a source file.  Optional line number ranges can be specified (see description below). The filename must be in quotes.\n\nIf no line number ranges are specified, the first line of the file will be omitted.  This is to prevent the `#!/usr/bin/env python` line from cluttering the markdown article. If you want to include the first line, use the range: `1-$`.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n{{import_source(\"__main__.py\")}} # includes all but line 1 from `__main__.py` file\n{{import_source(\"__main__.py\", [\"1-$\",])}} # imports all lines from `__main__.py`\n{{import_source(\"__main__.py\", [1, \"3\", \"5-$\"])}} # imports all lines except lines 2 and 4 from `__main__.py`\n{{import_source(\"__main__.py\", language=\"python\", filename=True)}} \n# includes all but line 1 from `__main__.py` file, puts the \n# contents in a python block with the filename as a comment in \n# the first line of the block.\n```\n\n\n`MarkPlates` will display an error message to `stderr` if a file is not found.\n\n### `import_function()`\n\nThe `import_function` function searches a source file for the named function, class, class method or assigned variable. The function name supports dot-references, for example to get at the class method `area()` inside the class `Sqaure`, the function name would be \"Square.area\". To retrieve a nested function, name both the parent and child function, for example \"outer.inner\". \n\nThe first piece of code matching the given name is returned, (and you shouldn't have multiple things with the same name anyway!). The source file is parsed, not loaded, so no import side-effects take place.\n\nWhitespace following the function will not be included.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n{{import_function(\"__main__.py\", \"condense_ranges\")}} # imports the function named `condense_ranges` from `__main__.py`\n```\n\n\nThe `language` and `filename` parameters are treated the same way they are in `import_source()`.\n\n### `import_repl()`\n\nThe `import_repl` function takes the input parameter and splits it into separate lines.  Each line of the input will be run in a REPL with the `stdout` and `stderr` captured to insert into the final output. The result should appear similar to a copy-paste from running the same commands manually.\n\nThere is an exception, however.  Blank input lines are used for spacing and will not display the `>>>` prompt one would normally see in the REPL.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n{{import_repl(\n\"\"\"\ndef func(x):\n    if x:\n        print(x)\n\nfunc(True)\nfunc(False) \"\"\") }}\n```\n\n\nOutput:\n```\n>>> def func(x):\n...     if x:\n...         print(x)\n\n>>> func(True)\nTrue\n>>> func(False)\n\n```\n\n### Line Number Ranges\n\nLine number ranges allow you to specify which lines you want to include from the source file.   Ranges can be in the following form:\n\n* 3 or \"3\" : an integer adds just that line from the input\n\n* \"5-7\" : a range adds lines between start and end inclusive (so 5, 6, 7)\n\n* \"10-$\" : an unlimited range includes start line to the end of the file\n\n* \"$\" : the last line\n\n* \"$-3\" : negative indexing, the last line and the three lines that proceed it\n\n> **Note:** LINE NUMBERING STARTS AT 1!\n\n### Copy to Clipboard\n\nThe `-c` option will copy most of the output to the clipboard.  The first two lines are skipped, which generally are the `h1` title and the following blank line.  This is done to simplify copying the output to the Real Python CMS system.\n\n## Features to Come\n\nI'd like to add:\n\n* Developer Instructions\n* Capturing the results of a shell command and inserting into the file\n* Running `black` over the included Python source\n* Windows and Mac testing/support\n\n## Interested?\n\nLet me know!  If you're interested in the results or would like to help out, please raise an issue and I'll be in touch!\n\n## Release History\n\n* 1.5.0 Added `$` and `$-n` as valid line ranges. Fixed several bugs\n* 1.4.0 Added -c option, bug fixes\n* 1.3.0 Minor bug fixes\n* 1.2.0 Added `language` and `filename` options for `import_source` and `import_repl` methods\n* 1.1.0 Added `import_repl` functionality\n* 1.0.0 Initial release\n\nLicense plate graphic thanks to [ACME License Maker](https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/)\n\n\n",
