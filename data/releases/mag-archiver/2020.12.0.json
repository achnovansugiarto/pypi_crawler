    "description": "# MAG Archiver\nMAG Archiver is an Azure Function App that automatically archives Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) releases so that they \ncan be transferred to other cloud services.\n\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)\n[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue)\n![Python package](https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver)\n\n## Status\nThis is a proof of concept; the functionality for archiving and compressing each MAG release has not been implemented yet.\n\n## Setup\nThe following instructions explain how to setup Mag Archiver.\n\n### Dependencies\n* [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)\n* [Install Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=linux%2Ccsharp%2Cbash)\n* [Create an Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)\n  * Region: choose an Azure region that is close to the other cloud provider that you want to transfer the data to.\n  * Access tier: hot (need to be able to delete containers without cold storage deletion fees)\n  * Create container: mag-snapshots\n  * Under Blob Service > Lifecycle Management > Code view: add the life-cycle rules from lifecycle-rules.json\n    * These rules move blobs to the cold tier after 30 days and delete the blobs after 61 days.\n* [Create an Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal)\n  * Take note of your function app name, you will need it later.\n  * Under Settings > Configuration > Application settings, add the following Application settings (name: value):\n    * STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME: the name of your storage account.\n    * STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY: they key for your storage account.\n    * TARGET_CONTAINER: mag-snapshots\n* [Subscribe to Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-provisioning) \n\n### Deploy to Azure\nTo deploy mag-archiver follow the instructions below.\n\n#### Setup Azure account\nMake sure that the Azure account that your Function App is deployed to is set as the default.\n\nTo do this, list your accounts and copy the id of the account that should be the default account:\n```bash\naz account list\n```\n\nSet the account to the Azure account that your Function App is deployed to:\n```bash\naz account set -s <insert your account id here>\n```\n\nCheck that the correct account is set, you should see your account show up:\n```bash\naz account show\n```\n\n#### Deploy the Function App\nClone the project:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver.git\n```\n\nEnter the function app folder:\n```bash\ncd mag-archiver\n```\n\nDeploy the function:\n```bash\nfunc azure functionapp publish <your function app name> --python\n```\n\n## Architecture\nThe architecture of MAG Archiver is illustrated via the deployment and process view diagrams below.\n\n### Process View\nThe MAG subscription adds each new MAG release as a new Azure Blob storage container in the user's Azure Storage \naccount.\n\nAn [Azure Function App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) runs every 10 minutes and checks to \nsee if any new MAG release containers have been added.\n\n![process view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver/develop/docs/process_view.svg)\n\nMetadata about which MAG releases have been discovered and processed are stored in an \n[Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/) table called `MagReleases`. \nThe `MagReleases` table is also used used to enable the Apache Airflow MAG workflow to query and find out what MAG \nreleases have finished processing and where on the Azure blob storage container they can be downloaded from. A \n[share access signature (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) \nwith read only privileges is used to provide the Apache Airflow MAG workflow with access to the table.\n\nWhen the Function App finds a new MAG release, it copies the files from the container onto a shared container called\n`mag-snapshots` under a folder with the same name as the container it was copied from. After copying the files, the \noriginal container is deleted. \n\nThe Function App copies the MAG files to a shared container so that the Apache Airflow MAG workflow only needs to \nhold a single SAS token, one for the shared container. In the future the copying of files by the Cloud Function can be \nreplaced by a service that compresses the files, as shown in the diagram above.\n\nA total of two SAS tokens are shared: one for the `MagReleases` table and one for the `mag-snapshots` container.\n\n### Deployment View\nThe deployment view below shows what services are used and where they are deployed. \n\n![deployment view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Academic-Observatory/mag-archiver/develop/docs/deployment_view.svg)",
