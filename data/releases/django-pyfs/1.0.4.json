    "description": "django-pyfs\n===========\n\nA Django module which extends pyfilesystem with several methods to\nmake it convenient for web use. Specifically, it extends pyfilesystem\nwith two methods:\n\n    fs.get_url(filename, timeout=0)\n\nThis will return a externally-usable URL to the resource. If\ntimeout>0, the URL may stop working after that period (in\nseconds). Details are implementation-dependent. On Amazon S3, this is\na secure URL, which is only available for that period. For a static\nfilesystem, the URLs are unsecure and permanent. \n\n    fs.expire(filename, seconds, days, expires=True)\n\nThis allows us to create temporary objects. Our use-case was that we\nwanted to generate visualizations to users which were .png images. The\nlifetime of those images was a single web request, so we set them to\nexpire after a few minutes. Another use case was memoization.\n\nNote that expired files are not automatically removed. To remove them,\ncall `expire_objects()`. In our system, we had a cron job do\nthis for a while. Celery, manual removals, etc. are all options. \n\nTo configure a django-pyfs to use static files, set a parameter in\nDjango settings: \n\n    DJFS = {'type' : 'osfs',\n                     'directory_root' : 'djpyfs/static/djpyfs', \n                     'url_root' : '/static/djpyfs'}\n\nHere, `directory_root` is where the files go. `url_root` is the URL\nbase of where your web server is configured to serve them from.\n\nTo use files on S3, you need `boto` installed. Then, \n\n    DJFS = {'type' : 's3fs',\n            'bucket' : 'my-bucket', \n            'prefix' : '/pyfs/' } \n\n`bucket` is your S3 bucket. `prefix` is optional, and gives a base\nwithin that bucket.\n\nTo get your filesystem, call: \n\n    def get_filesystem(namespace)\n\nEach module should pass a unique namespace. These will typically\ncorrespond to subdirectories within the filesystem. \n\nThe django-pyfs interface is designed as a generic (non-Django\nspecific) extension to pyfilesystem. However, the specific\nimplementation is very Django-specific. \n\nGood next steps would be to:\n\n* Allow Django storages to act as a back-end for pyfilesystem\n* Allow django-pyfs to act as a back-end for Django storages\n* Support more types of pyfilesystems (esp. in-memory would be nice)\n* General code cleanup, documentation, test cases, etc. \n* Add better test support. Django does nice things with resetting \n  DBs to a know state for testing. It'd be nice to do the same here. \n\nState: This code is tested and has worked well in a range of settings,\nand is currently deployed on edx.org. However, it doesn't have test\ncases and similar, so can't be considered truly production-ready. The\nexpiration functionality, in particular, we are not using right now.",
