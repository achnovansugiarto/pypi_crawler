It is being developed as a best effort to support an integration plugin for Home Assistant.\n\n__Current Implementation is read only__\n\nThere are two entry points for the Mastertherm Heat Pumps:\n- mastertherm.vip-it.cz - This is the server for pre 2022 heat pumps\n- mastertherm.online - This is the server for 2022 onward\n\nNOTES:\n- materhterm.online is sensitive to too many requests so take care when using the command line or using this libary. The Application and Web App does a refresh on one module/ unit every 30 seconds.\n- if multiple requests are sent at the same time (i.e. from home assistant/ the app and web) some will be refused by the servers, its temporary.  The updates have been built to report but ignore these.\n\n## Installation\nReleases are done using PyPi, the release is here: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/masterthermconnect\" target=\"_blank\">masterthermconnect</a>\n- Latest Release Version: python -m pip install masterthermconnect\n- Specific Version or Pre-Release e.g.: python -m pip install masterthermconnect==1.1.0rc9\n\n### Command Line\nThis is used as a libary but it can also be run directly for debug purposes:\n\nDO NOT RUN THIS TOO FREQUENTLY, the new API may lock you're IP out for an unknown period of time.  The app and web app refresh every 30 seconds. I don't know how many times in succession would lock you out, probably frequent calls over a period of time such as an hour.\n\n```\nusage: masterthermconnect [-h] [--version] [--api-ver {v1,v2}] [--hide-sensitive]\n[--user USER] [--password PASSWORD] [--list-devices]\n[--list-device-data] [--list-device-reg LIST_DEVICE_REG] [--pretty]\n\nOptions:\n    -h, --help                          show this help message and exit<br>\n    --version                           display the Mastertherm Connect API version<br>\n    --api-ver {v1,v2}                   API Version to use: Default: v1 (pre 2022), v2 (post 2022)<br>\n    --hide-sensitive                    Hide the sensitive information, for debug information for sharing.<br>\n    --user USER                         login user for Mastertherm<br>\n    --password PASSWORD                 login password for Mastertherm<br>\n    --list-devices                      list the devices connected to the account<br>\n    --list-device-data                  list the data for each device connected to the account<br>\n    --list-device-reg LIST_DEVICE_REG   list Registers e.g. A_330 or A_330,A_331 or 'all' for everything.<br>\n    ---pretty                           Pritify the Output in JSON Format.<br>\n```\n\nIf you can login using mastertherm.online then use the api version v2, for mastertherm.vip-it.cz use v1 or do not provide.\n\nIf you use spaces in your user name relpace the space with a +.\n\n### API Version\nFor examples on how to use the API please see `__main__.py` file as an exmaple, it is quite simple to use and retrieve information and is documented inline:\n\nTo import the required modules:\n```\nfrom masterthermconnect import (\n    MasterthermController,\n    MasterthermAuthenticationError,\n    MasterthermConnectionError,\n    MasterthermResponseFormatError,\n    MasterthermTokenInvalid,\n    MasterthermUnsupportedRole,\n    MasterthermUnsupportedVersion,\n)\n```\n\nTo setup a connection create a new aiohttp ClientSession and pass the login details:\n```\n    async def connect(\n        username: str, password: str, api_version: str, refresh: bool\n    ) -> MasterthermController:\n        \"\"\"Setup and Connect to the Mastertherm Server.\"\"\"\n        # Login to the Server.\n        session = ClientSession()\n        controller = MasterthermController(\n            username, password, session, api_version=api_version\n        )\n\n        try:\n            await controller.connect()\n            if refresh:\n                await controller.refresh()\n\n            return controller\n        except MasterthermAutenticationError as mte:\n            print(\"Authentication Failed \" + mte.message)\n        except MaseterthermConnectionError as mte:\n            print(\"Connection Failed \" + mte.message)\n        finally:\n            await session.close()\n\n        return None\n```\n\nDevice Information and Data can be retrieved from the controller for example. Data is available in a dictionary format described below:\n```\n     devices = controller.get_devices()\n     device_data = controller.get_device_data(module_id, unit_id)\n```\n\n## Heat Pump Details\nCurrent version is read only, updates do not work yet but that will be worked on in the next version, the work is best effort so there is no quick implementations and it is being developed to support the Home Assistant integration.\n\nEverything is based on observations from the Web and Android Applications, the current testing has been done on some basic setup we have not tested options with Solar and Pool but have tried to add sensors based on the apps.\n1. One Main circuit with heating and cooling and domestic hot water with attached room thermostats\n2. Main Circuit for heating and two optional circuits for Barn and House Domestic Hot Water, no room thermostats\n\n#### Mapping Setup\nPretty much every piece of information and settings are stored as registry keys such as D_110 and I_120, there are hundreds. There is a mapping to the structure used in this module in the const.py.\n\nThe data is stored under the controller as an array of module and unit's making a device.\n\n```\n{\n    \"module_id_unit_id\": {\n        \"last_data_update\": <datetime> control data update frequency\n        \"last_info_update\": <datetime> control info update frequently\n        \"last_update_time\": \"1192282722\" used for data updates in the API\n        \"info\":             normallised information for the device\n        \"data\":             normallised data for the devive\n        \"api_info\":         All Info retrieved from the API\n        \"api_update_data\":  All Updated Data since last update\n        \"api_full_data\":    Full Data including last updated\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe information is stored as key value pairs as below:\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"givenname\",\n    \"surname\": \"surname\",\n    \"country\": \"localization\",\n    \"language\": \"lang\",\n    \"hp_type\": \"type\",\n    \"controller\": \"regulation\",\n    \"exp\": \"exp\",\n    \"output\": \"output\",\n    \"reservation\": \"reservation\",\n    \"place\": \"city\",\n    \"latitude\": \"password9\",\n    \"longitude\": \"password10\",\n    \"notes\": \"notes\",\n    \"pada\": \"pada\",\n    \"padb\": \"padb\",\n    \"padc\": \"padc\",\n    \"padd\": \"padd\",\n    \"pade\": \"pade\",\n    \"padf\": \"padf\",\n    \"padz\": \"padz\",\n}\n```\n\nThe data is normallies based on the following key value pairs and sub dictionary setup below is the format but exact mappings can be found in the const.py file.\n\nWhere possble the normalized data is filtered out based on whether a feature is enabled or not, for example HC0-HC6, Pool and Solar are avaialble only if the circuits are enabled and available.\n```\n{\n    \"hp_power_state\": [\"bool\", \"D_3\"],\n    \"hp_function\": [\"int\", \"I_51\"],  # 0: heating, #1: cooling, #2: auto (Write)\n    \"season\": [\"fixed\", \"\"],  # summer, auto:summer, winter, auto:winter\n    \"operating_mode\": [\"fixed\", \"heating\"],  # heating, cooling, pool, dhw, dpc\n    \"cooling_mode\": [\"bool\", \"D_4\"],\n    \"control_curve_heating\": {\n        \"setpoint_a_outside\": [\"float\", \"A_122\"],\n    },\n    \"control_curve_cooling\": {\n        \"setpoint_a_outside\": [\"float\", \"A_362\"],\n    },\n    \"domestic_hot_water\": {\n        \"heating\": [\"bool\", \"D_66\"],\n        \"enabled\": [\"bool\", \"D_275\"],\n    },\n    \"compressor_running\": [\"bool\", \"D_5\"],\n    \"compressor2_running\": [\"bool\", \"D_32\"],\n    \"runtime_info\": {\n        \"compressor_run_time\": [\"int\", \"I_11\"],\n        \"compressor_start_counter\": [\"int\", \"I_12\"],\n    },\n    \"season_info\": {\n        \"hp_season\": [\"bool\", \"D_24\"],  # True is Winter, False is Summer (Write)\n        \"hp_seasonset\": [\"int\", \"I_50\"],  # True is Manually Set, False Auto (Write)\n    },\n    \"error_info\": {\n        \"some_error\": [\"bool\", \"D_20\"],\n        \"three_errors\": [\"bool\", \"D_21\"],\n    },\n    \"heating_circuits\": {}, # Heating and Cooling Circuits\n}\n```\n\nThe Heating/ Cooling Ciruits are optionally installed, HC0 refers to the main heat pump, HC1 to 6 are optional heating and cooling cirguits and additionally there is Pool and Solar as optional components.\n\nIn addition each Heating/ Cooling Circuit can have a room thermostat installed or not.  Where possible the sections that are not enabled are removed.\n\nWithin each of the hc0 to hc6 a room thermostat can be installed if so then the pad sub key is enabled, if not then the int sub key is enabled.\n\n```\n{\n    \"hc0\": {\n        \"enabled\": boolean Disabled if any of HC1 to HC6 are installed.\n        \"name\": [\"string\", []],  # hc0 does not have a name, default is Home\n        \"int\": {\n            \"enabled\": [\"fixed\", False],  # Not located the Register\n            \"ambient_requested\": [\"float\", \"A_210\"],\n            \"ambient_temp\": [\"float\", \"A_211\"],\n        },\n        \"pad\": {\n            \"enabled\": [\"fixed\", True],  # Not located the Register D_193?\n            \"current_humidity\": [\"float\", \"I_185\"],\n            \"ambient_requested\": [\"float\", \"A_189\"],\n            \"ambient_temp\": [\"float\", \"A_190\"],\n        },\n    },\n    \"hc1\": {\n        \"enabled\": [\"fixed\", False],\n        \"name\": [\n            \"string\",\n            [\"I_211\", \"I_212\", \"I_213\", \"I_214\", \"I_215\", \"I_216\"],\n        ],\n        \"on\": [\"bool\", \"D_212\"],\n        \"int\": {\n            \"enabled\": [\"not bool\", \"D_245\"],\n        },\n        \"pad\": {\n            \"enabled\": [\"bool\", \"D_245\"],\n        },\n        \"control_curve_heating\": {\n            \"setpoint_a_outside\": [\"float\", \"A_101\"],\n        },\n        \"control_curve_cooling\": {\n            \"setpoint_a_outside\": [\"float\", \"A_314\"],\n        },\n    },\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    \"solar\": {\n        \"enabled\": [\"bool\", \"D_433\"],\n        \"name\": [\"fixed\", \"Solar\"],\n    },\n    \"pool\": {\n        \"enabled\": [\"bool\", \"D_348\"],\n        \"name\": [\"fixed\", \"Pool\"],\n    },\n}\n```\n\n***\n[commits-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect?style=for-the-badge\n[commits]: https://github.com/shedc/python-masterthermconnect/commits/main\n[license-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/shedc/python-masterthermconnect?style=for-the-badge\n[maintenance-shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/maintainer-Richard%20Holmes%20%40shedc-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge\n\n[releases]: https://github.com/shedc/python-masterthermconnect/releases\n[stable-release-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/shedc/python-masterthermconnect?style=flat\n[latest-release-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/shedc/python-masterthermconnect?include_prereleases&style=flat\n\n[workflows-stable]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-release.yml/badge.svg\n[workflow-stable]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-release.yml/badge.svg\n[workflows-latest]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-prerelease.yml/badge.svg\n[workflow-latest]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-prerelease.yml/badge.svg\n[workflows-main]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-main.yml/badge.svg\n[workflow-main]: https://github.com/sHedC/python-masterthermconnect/actions/workflows/push-main.yml/badge.svg\n",
