    "description": "# DKUtils\n\n## Description\nThe DKUtils python package was written to provide utility functions and classes that are used in DataKitchen recipes. \nIt serves two main purposes.\n\n1. Provide a Python API Client for interacting with the DataKitchen platformâ€™s REST API (DataKitchenClient)\n2. Provide utility classes and methods for interacting with tools commonly orchestrated in recipes in the DataKitchen platform (Alteryx, Jira, Gmail, etc.)\n\n## Development Info\nBuilding and testing this module is conveniently done using Make. Issue the `make` command to see a list\nof available targets (shown below for convenience). Note that any target can be suffixed with `-ext` to \nrun that target inside a Docker container. This allows testing and development in a standard and portable\nenvironment. To develop inside a running docker container, use the `bash-ext` target. This will drop the \nuser into a bash shell inside a running container.\n\n    Add '-ext' to any target to run it inside a docker container\n\n    Versioning:\n        bump/major bump/minor bump/patch - bump the version\n\n    Utilities:\n        bash         run bash - typically used in conjunction with -ext to enter a docker container\n        scan_secrets scan source code for sensitive information\n\n    Linting:\n        lint         run flake8 and yapf\n        flake8       run flake8\n        yapf         run yapf and correct issues in-place\n        yapf-diff    run yapf and display diff between existing code and resolution if in-place is used\n\n    Testing:\n        test         run all unit tests\n        test_unit    run all unit tests\n        clean_unit   remove files from last test run (e.g. report_dir, .coverage, etc.)\n        tox          run unit tests in python 2 and 3\n        clean_tox    clean tox files (e.g. .tox)\n\n    Documentation:\n        docs         generate Sphinx documentation\n        docs/html    generate Sphinx documentation\n        docs/clean   remove generated Sphinx documentation\n\n    Build and Upload:\n        build        generate distribution archives (i.e. *.tar.gz and *.whl)\n        upload       upload distribution archives to PyPI\n        clean_build  remove all the build files (i.e. build, dist, *.egg-info)\n\n    Cleanup:\n        clean        run all the clean targets in one go\n        clean_pyc    remove all *.pyc files\n\n[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is also included to validate and flag commits that contain code \nthat does not pass [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf). \nTo use, first install the python package `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install`. All \nfuture commits will run these tools and deny commits that don't pass. When running YAPF, `pre-commit` will\nmake in-place corrections to your code. Therefore, if it fails the YAPF validation on the first commit \nattempt, simply review the changed files, add, and commit again to resolve.  \n\n\n",
