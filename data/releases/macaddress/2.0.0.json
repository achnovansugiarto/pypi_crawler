    "description": "macaddress\n==========\n\nA module for handling hardware identifiers like MAC addresses.\n\nThis module makes it easy to:\n\n1. check if a string represents a valid MAC address, or a similar\n   hardware identifier like an EUI-64, OUI, etc,\n\n2. convert between string and binary forms of MAC addresses and\n   other hardware identifiers,\n\nand so on.\n\nHeavily inspired by the ``ipaddress`` module, but not yet quite\nas featureful.\n\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nThis library's version numbers follow the `SemVer 2.0.0\nspecification <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    pip install macaddress\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nImport:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import macaddress\n\nClasses are provided for the common hardware identifier\ntypes: ``EUI48`` (also available as ``MAC``), ``EUI64``,\n``OUI``, and so on. If those aren't enough, you can\neasily define others with just a few lines of code.\n\n\nParse or Validate String\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen only one address type is valid:\n````````````````````````````````````\n\nAll provided classes support the standard and common formats.\nFor example, the ``EUI48`` class supports the following\nformats:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.EUI48('01-23-45-67-89-ab')\n    EUI48('01-23-45-67-89-AB')\n    >>> macaddress.EUI48('01:23:45:67:89:ab')\n    EUI48('01-23-45-67-89-AB')\n    >>> macaddress.EUI48('0123.4567.89ab')\n    EUI48('01-23-45-67-89-AB')\n    >>> macaddress.EUI48('0123456789ab')\n    EUI48('01-23-45-67-89-AB')\n\nYou can inspect what formats a hardware address class supports\nby looking at its ``formats`` attribute:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.OUI.formats\n    ('xx-xx-xx', 'xx:xx:xx', 'xxxxxx')\n\nEach ``x`` in the format string matches one hexadecimal\n\"digit\", and all other characters are matched literally.\n\nIf the string does not match one of the formats, a\n``ValueError`` is raised:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> try:\n    ...     macaddress.MAC('foo bar')\n    ... except ValueError as error:\n    ...     print(error)\n    ...\n    'foo bar' cannot be parsed as EUI48\n\nIf you need to parse in a format that isn't supported,\nyou can define a subclass and add the formats:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class MAC(macaddress.MAC):\n    ...     formats = macaddress.MAC.formats + (\n    ...         'xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-',\n    ...         'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:',\n    ...         'xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.',\n    ...     )\n    ...\n    >>> MAC('01-02-03-04-05-06-')\n    MAC('01-02-03-04-05-06')\n\n    >>> class MAC(macaddress.MAC):\n    ...     formats = macaddress.MAC.formats + (\n    ...         'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',\n    ...         'xxx xxx xxx xxx',\n    ...         'xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx',\n    ...         'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx',\n    ...     )\n    ...\n    >>> MAC('012 345 678 9AB')\n    MAC('01-23-45-67-89-AB')\n\nWhen multiple address types are valid:\n``````````````````````````````````````\n\nThere is also a ``parse`` function for when you have a string\nwhich might be one of several classes:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from macaddress import EUI48, EUI64, OUI\n\n    >>> macaddress.parse('01:02:03', OUI, EUI48)\n    OUI('01-02-03')\n    >>> macaddress.parse('01:02:03:04:05:06', OUI, EUI48, EUI64)\n    EUI48('01-02-03-04-05-06')\n    >>> macaddress.parse('010203040506', EUI64, EUI48)\n    EUI48('01-02-03-04-05-06')\n    >>> macaddress.parse('0102030405060708', EUI64, EUI48, OUI)\n    EUI64('01-02-03-04-05-06-07-08')\n\nIf the input string cannot be parsed as any of\nthe given classes, a ``ValueError`` is raised:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> try:\n    ...     macaddress.parse('01:23', EUI48, OUI)\n    ... except ValueError as error:\n    ...     print(error)\n    ...\n    '01:23' cannot be parsed as EUI48 or OUI\n    >>> try:\n    ...     macaddress.parse('01:23', EUI48, OUI, EUI64)\n    ... except ValueError as error:\n    ...     print(error)\n    ...\n    '01:23' cannot be parsed as EUI48, OUI, or EUI64\n\nNote that the message of the ``ValueError`` tries to be helpful\nfor developers, but it is not localized, nor is its exact text\npart of the official public interface covered by SemVer.\n\n\nParse from Bytes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll ``macaddress`` classes can be constructed from raw bytes:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.MAC(b'abcdef')\n    EUI48('61-62-63-64-65-66')\n    >>> macaddress.OUI(b'abc')\n    OUI('61-62-63')\n\nIf the byte string is the wrong size, a ``ValueError`` is raised:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> try:\n    ...     macaddress.MAC(b'\\x01\\x02\\x03')\n    ... except ValueError as error:\n    ...     print(error)\n    ...\n    b'\\x01\\x02\\x03' has wrong length for EUI48\n\n\nParse from Integers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll ``macaddress`` classes can be constructed from raw integers:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.MAC(0x010203ffeedd)\n    EUI48('01-02-03-FF-EE-DD')\n    >>> macaddress.OUI(0x010203)\n    OUI('01-02-03')\n\nNote that the least-significant bit of the integer value maps\nto the last bit in the address type, so the same integer has\na different meaning depending on the class you use it with:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.MAC(1)\n    EUI48('00-00-00-00-00-01')\n    >>> macaddress.OUI(1)\n    OUI('00-00-01')\n\nIf the integer is too large for the hardware identifier class\nthat you're trying to construct, a ``ValueError`` is raised:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> try:\n    ...     macaddress.OUI(1_000_000_000)\n    ... except ValueError as error:\n    ...     print(error)\n    ...\n    1000000000 is too big for OUI\n\n\nGet as String\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> mac = macaddress.MAC('01-02-03-0A-0B-0C')\n    >>> str(mac)\n    '01-02-03-0A-0B-0C'\n\nFor simple cases of changing the output format, you\ncan just compose string operations:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> str(mac).replace('-', ':')\n    '01:02:03:0A:0B:0C'\n    >>> str(mac).replace('-', '')\n    '0102030A0B0C'\n    >>> str(mac).lower()\n    '01-02-03-0a-0b-0c'\n\nFor more complicated cases, you can define a subclass\nwith the desired output format as the first format:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class MAC(macaddress.MAC):\n    ...     formats = (\n    ...         'xxx xxx xxx xxx',\n    ...     ) + macaddress.MAC.formats\n    ...\n    >>> MAC(mac)\n    MAC('010 203 0A0 B0C')\n\n\nGet as Bytes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> mac = macaddress.MAC('61-62-63-04-05-06')\n    >>> bytes(mac)\n    b'abc\\x04\\x05\\x06'\n\n\nGet as Integer\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> mac = macaddress.MAC('01-02-03-04-05-06')\n    >>> int(mac)\n    1108152157446\n    >>> int(mac) == 0x010203040506\n    True\n\n\nGet the OUI\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMost classes supplied by this module have the ``oui``\nattribute, which returns their first three bytes as\nan OUI object:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.MAC('01:02:03:04:05:06').oui\n    OUI('01-02-03')\n\n\nCompare\n~~~~~~~\n\nEquality\n````````\n\nAll ``macaddress`` classes support equality comparisons:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> macaddress.OUI('01-02-03') == macaddress.OUI('01:02:03')\n    True\n    >>> macaddress.OUI('01-02-03') == macaddress.OUI('ff-ee-dd')\n    False\n    >>> macaddress.OUI('01-02-03') != macaddress.CDI32('01-02-03-04')\n    True\n    >>> macaddress.OUI('01-02-03') != macaddress.CDI32('01-02-03-04').oui\n    False\n\nOrdering\n````````\n\nAll ``macaddress`` classes support total\nordering. The comparisons are designed to\nintuitively sort identifiers that start\nwith the same bits next to each other:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> some_values = [\n    ...     MAC('ff-ee-dd-01-02-03'),\n    ...     MAC('ff-ee-00-99-88-77'),\n    ...     MAC('ff-ee-dd-01-02-04'),\n    ...     OUI('ff-ee-dd'),\n    ... ]\n    >>> for x in sorted(some_values):\n    ...     print(x)\n    FF-EE-00-01-02-03\n    FF-EE-DD\n    FF-EE-DD-01-02-03\n    FF-EE-DD-01-02-04\n\n\nDefine New Types\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf this library does not provide a hardware address\ntype that you need, you can easily define your own.\n\nFor example, this is all it takes to define\nIP-over-InfiniBand link-layer addresses:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class InfiniBand(macaddress.HWAddress):\n        size = 20 * 8  # size in bits; 20 octets\n\n        formats = (\n            'xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx',\n            'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',\n            'xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx',\n            'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n            # or whatever formats you want to support\n        )\n        # All formats are tried when parsing from string,\n        # and the first format is used when stringifying.\n\n\n",
