    "description": "# Filecoin Mechanical Twin\n\nMechanistic model for the Filecoin Economy. You can use this model to forecast all the components underlying Filecoin's circulating supply (i.e., minting, vesting, locking and burning), based on a set of parameters that encode storage provider behavior. The model uses the following assumptions:\n\n* Forecasting is done daily. This means that each forecasting step corresponds to a day and the forecasted metrics correspond to the value we expect to see at the end of that day.\n* The model uses the current sector states (i.e. known schedule expirations) and it estimates future onboardings and future renewals.\n* The daily power onboarded is provided as a tunable parameter.\n* The sector renewal rates are provided as a tunable parameter.\n* Sector duration is a constant provided as a tunable parameter.\n* Filecoin Plus sectors have the same renewal rates and sector durations as other sectors.\n* The model uses the current pledge metrics (i.e. known scheduled expiration in pledge) to measure known active sectors, and it estimates pledge metrics coming from future onboardings and renewals using the same assumptions as the ones used to model storage power.\n* The model ignores storage deal collateral when computing the total locked FIL.\n\nTo learn more about how the model is designed, check the specifications linked at the end of this readme.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n```\nnumpy>=1.23.1\npandas>=1.4.3\nrequests>=2.28.1\nmatplotlib>=3.5.2\nseaborn>=0.11.2\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nThis package is available on PyPI and thus can be directly installed with pip:\n\n```\npip install mechaFIL\n```\n\nAlternatively, this package can be installed from source by cloning this repository and installing it manually with the command:\n\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThere is a high-level function that can be used to run a forecast/simulation of circulating supply and its components. First you need to import the relevant packages:\n\n```python\nimport mechafil\nimport datetime\n```\n\nNow, you need to define some parameters:\n\n```python\n# Starting date for the simulation\nstart_date = datetime.date(2021, 3, 15)\n# Current date\ncurrent_date = datetime.date(2022, 11, 1) \n# Number of days to run the simulation (after current_rate)\nforecast_length = 365\n# Renewal rate of all sectors (percentage of raw-byte that will renew)\nrenewal_rate= 0.6\n# Raw-byte power (in PiB) that is onboarded every day\nrb_onboard_power = 12.0\n# Percentage of raw-byte power onboarded that contains FIL+ deals\nfil_plus_rate = 0.098\n# Sector duration of newly onboarding sectors\nduration = 360\n```\n\nTwo important notes regarding the inputs:\n* Due to data availability, the start date cannot be earlier than 2021-03-15.\n* The parameters `renewal_rate`, `rb_onboard_power` and `fil_plus_rate` can be a single number or a vector of numbers. If they are a number, the model assumes that number as a constant throughout the simulation. If a vector is provided, then the vector needs to have the same size as the simulation length. The vector option gives the user the most flexibility since they can apply different constants throughout the simulation.\n\nNow, you can call the simulation function and collect the data in a DataFrame:\n\n```python\ncil_df = mechafil.run_simple_sim(start_date,\n    current_date,\n    forecast_length,\n    renewal_rate,\n    rb_onboard_power,\n    fil_plus_rate,\n    duration)\n\ncil_df.head()\n```\n\nYou can also run part of the simulation separately.
