    "description": "Project highlights\n==================\nThe core engine is a high level interface to PyLucene, which is a Python extension for accessing the popular Java Lucene search engine.\nLucene has a reputation for being a relatively low-level toolkit, and the goal of PyLucene is to wrap it through automatic code generation.\nSo although PyLucene transforms Java idioms to Python idioms where possible, the resulting interface is far from Pythonic.\nSee examples for comparisons with the Lucene API.\n\nA RESTful JSON search server, based on CherryPy.\nMany python applications which require better search capabilities are migrating from using conventional client-server databases, whereas Lucene is an embedded search library.\nSolr is a popular option for remote searching and other advanced features, but then any customization or embedded use is coupled to Java and XML.\nUsing a python web framework instead can provide the best of both worlds, e.g., batch indexing offline and remote searching live.\n\nA simple client to make interacting with the server as convenient as an RPC interface.\nIt handles all of the HTTP interactions, with support for compression, json, and connection reuse.\n\nAdvanced search features:\n * Distributed searching with support for replication, partitioning, and sharding.\n * Optimized faceted and grouped search.\n * Optimized prefix and range queries.\n * Geospatial support.\n * Spellchecking.\n * Near real-time indexing.\n\nChanges in 1.5\n==================\n * Engine:\n   \n   - PyLucene 4.5 supported\n   - PyLucene 3 dropped\n   - Fields use new FieldType interface\n   - SortField comparators optimized and support multiple values\n   - Check index utility\n   - Grouping contrib improvements\n\n * Server:\n   \n   - Retrieval of multiple indexed values",
