Post a new comment. (v2.0.0 authenticated and anonymous users)\n\n    2. Reply to an existing comment. (v2.0.0 authenticated and anonymous users)\n\n    3. Edit a comment. (authenticated user `comment owner`)\n\n    4. Delete a comment. (authenticated user `comment owner` and admins)\n\n    5. React to a comment. (authenticated users) Available reactions are LIKE and DISLIKE  # open PR if you would like to have more reactions\n\n    6. Report (flag) a comment. (authenticated users)\n\n    7. Delete flagged comment. (admins and moderators)\n\n    8. Resolve or reject flag. This is used to revoke the flagged comment state (admins and moderators)\n\n- All actions are done by Fetch API since V2.0.0\n\n- Bootstrap 4.1.1 is used in comment templates for responsive design.\n\n.. _Installation:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nRequirements:\n-------------\n\n    1. **django>=2.1**\n    2. **djangorestframework**  # only for the API Framework\n    3. **Bootstrap 4.1.1**\n\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\n\nInstallation is available via ``pip``\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install django-comments-dab\n\n\nor via source on github\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/radi85/Comment.git\n    $ cd Comment\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nComment Settings and urls:\n--------------------------\n\n    1. Add ``comment`` to installed_apps in the ``settings.py`` file. It should be added after ``django.contrib.auth``.\n    2. ``LOGIN_URL`` shall be defined in the settings.\n\n``settings.py`` should look like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        'django.contrib.admin',\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        ...\n        'comment',\n        ..\n    )\n\n    LOGIN_URL = 'login'  # or actual url\n\nIn ``urls.py``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns(\n        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n        path('comment/', include('comment.urls')),\n        ...\n        path('api/', include('comment.api.urls')),  # only required for API Framework\n        ...\n    )\n\nMigrations:\n-----------\n\nMigrate comment app:\n\n::\n\n    $ python manage.py migrate comment\n\n\n.. _Setup:\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nStep 1 - Connecting comment model with the target model\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn models.py add the field ``comments`` as a ``GenericRelation`` field to the required model.\n\nPS: Please note that the field name must be ``comments`` **NOT** ``comment``.\n\nE.g. ``Post`` model, as shown below:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericRelation\n\n    from comment.models import Comment\n\n    class Post(models.Model):\n        author = models.ForeignKey(User)\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        body = models.TextField()\n        # the field name should be comments\n        comments = GenericRelation(Comment)\n\nStep 2 - Adding template tags:\n------------------------------\n\n``render_comments`` *tag uses 2 required and 1 optional args*:\n\n    1. Instance of the targeted model. (**Required**)\n    2. Request object. (**Required**)\n    3. oauth. (optional - Default is false)\n\n\n.. _Usage:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n1. Basics usage:\n----------------\n\n``include_static`` this tag will include CSS and javascript files,\n\n``include_bootstrap`` tag is for bootstrap-4.1.1, if it’s already used in the project, get rid of this tag.\n\nIn the template (e.g. post_detail.) add the following template tags where ``obj`` is the instance of post model.\n\n.. code:: jinja\n\n    {% load comment_tags %}  {# Loading the template tag #}\n    {% render_comments obj request %}  {# Render all the comments belong to the passed object \"obj\" #}\n\n\n2. Advanced usage:\n------------------\n\n1. Pagination:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy default the comments will be paginated, 10 comments per page.\nTo disable the pagination, set ``COMMENT_PER_PAGE=None`` in your settings file.\nTo change the default number, set ``COMMENT_PER_PAGE=number``.\n\n.. code:: jinja\n\n    {% load comment_tags %}  {# Loading the template tag #}\n\n    {% render_comments obj request %}  {# Include comments belonging to a certain object #}\n    {% include_bootstrap %} {# Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project #}\n    {% include_static %} {# Include comment CSS and JS files #}\n\n\n\n2. Integrate user profile:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf you have a profile model for the user and you would like to show the\nprofile image next to each comment, do the following steps:\n\n- Add ``PROFILE_APP_NAME`` and ``PROFILE_MODEL_NAME`` variables to your ``settings.py`` file.\n    e.g if user profile app is called ``accounts`` and profile model is called ``UserProfile``\n\n``settings.py``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    PROFILE_APP_NAME = 'accounts'\n    PROFILE_MODEL_NAME = 'UserProfile' # letter case insensitive\n\n\n\n- Make sure that ``get_absolute_url`` method is defined in your profile model.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from django.urls import reverse\n\n    class UserProfile(models.Model):\n        user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n        ...\n        ...\n\n        # this method must be defined for appropriate url mapping in comments section\n        def get_absolute_url(self):\n            return reverse('your_profile_url_name')\n\n.. _`Enable Flagging`:\n\n3. Enable flagging:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe comment can be reported by the users.\nThis feature can be enabled by adding the ``COMMENT_FLAGS_ALLOWED`` to ``settings.py`` and its value must be greater than 0 (the default).\n\nThe comment that has been reported more than the ``COMMENT_FLAGS_ALLOWED`` value, will be hidden from the view.\nTo keep displaying the flagged comments to all users add ``COMMENT_SHOW_FLAGGED=True`` to ``settings.py``\n\nThe default report reasons are:\n\n    1. Spam | Exists only to promote a service.\n    2. Abusive | Intended at promoting hatred.\n    3. Something else. With a message info, this option will be always appended reasons list.\n\nThe reasons can be customized by adding ``COMMENT_FLAG_REASONS`` list of tuples to ``settings.py``. E.g.\n\n``settings.py``\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    COMMENT_FLAG_REASONS = [\n        (1, _('Spam | Exists only to promote a service')),\n        (2, _('Abusive | Intended at promoting hatred')),\n        (3, _('Racist | Sick mentality')),\n        (4, _('Whatever | Your reason')),\n        ...\n    ]\n\nThe flag model has currently 4 states: `since v1.6.7`\n\n    1. UNFLAGGED\n    2. **FLAGGED** - this case only the comment will be hidden\n    3. REJECTED - flag reasons are rejected by the moderator\n    4. RESOLVED - the comment content has been changed and accepted by the moderator\n\n\nGroups and Permissions:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nFor flagging purpose, the following groups and permissions will be created on the next migrate:\n\n**permissions:**\n    1. delete_comment  (default)\n    2. delete_flagged_comment\n\n**groups:**\n    1. comment_admin => has both mentioned permissions (edit permission might be added in the future)\n    2. comment_moderator => has delete_flagged_comment permission\n\n* Comment admin can delete any comment and change the state of flagged comment.\n* Comment moderator can delete FLAGGED comment only and change their state.\n\nPS: If the groups or the permissions don't exist, just run migrate. ``./manage.py migrate``\n\n\n4. Allow commenting by anonymous:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nCommenting by anonymous is disabled by default.\nAfter enabling this feature, unauthenticated users will be able to post a comment by providing their email address. Comments only hits the database, after they are verified. An email will be sent for confirmation. Only after confirming their email address, the comment will be saved along with their email address in the DB.\n\nHowever, since these comment are created anonymously, they won't be editable nor deletable like a normal comments(``comment_admins`` and ``comment_moderators`` can still delete them).\n\nBefore enabling this feature, make sure you set the ``get_absolute_url`` method on the model object with which the Comment model has been associated.\nFor e.g, if the ``Comment`` model has been associated with the ``Post`` model, make sure you have something like this set inside your ``models.py``\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class Post(models.Model):\n        ...\n\n        slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)\n\n        ...\n\n        def get_absolute_url(self):\n            return reverse('post:postdetail', kwargs={'slug': self.slug})\n\n\nTo enable this feature, the following settings variables need to be set alongside with django email settings:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    COMMENT_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS = True\n    COMMENT_FROM_EMAIL = 'no-reply@email.com'   # used for sending confirmation emails, if not set `EMAIL_HOST_USER` will be used.\n\nAlso, related to sending of email the following settings need to set.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'user@domain'\n    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'\n    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'    # this backend won't send emails but will just print them to the console. For production use your own backend.\n\n    # for production you may want to set this as backend\n    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'\n    # e.g for if you are using gmail , you may set:\n    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'\n\nTo further customize different attributes related to anonymous commenting, you may look into the `Settings`_ section for different configurations.\n\n.. _`Settings`: https://django-comment-dab.readthedocs.io/settings.html/\n\n\n.. _`Web API`:\n\nWeb API\n=======\n\ndjango-comments-dab uses django-rest-framework to expose a Web API that provides\ndevelopers with access to the same functionality offered through the web user interface.\n\nThe available actions with permitted user as follows:\n\n    1. Post a new comment. (authenticated and anonymous users)\n\n    2. Reply to an existing comment. (authenticated and anonymous users)\n\n    3. Edit a comment. (authenticated user `comment owner`)\n\n    4. Delete a comment you posted. (authenticated user `comment owner` and admins)\n\n    5. React to a comment. (authenticated users)\n\n    6. Report a comment. (authenticated users) Flagging system should be enabled.\n\n    7. Delete flagged comment. (admins and moderators)\n\n    8. Resolve or reject flag. This is used to revoke the flagged comment state (admins and moderators)\n\n    9. Retrieve the list of comments and associated replies to a given content type and object ID.\n\n    10. Confirm comment made by an anonymous users.\n\nThese actions are explained below.\n\nSetup:\n------\n\nTo integrate the comment API in your content type (e.g Post model), in ``serializers.py``\nfor the Post model add comments field as shown below:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from rest_framework import serializers\n    from comment.models import Comment\n    from comment.api.serializers import CommentSerializer\n\n\n    class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n\n        comments = serializers.SerializerMethodField()\n\n        class Meta:\n            model = Post\n            fields = (\n                'id',\n                ...\n                ...\n                'comments'\n            )\n\n        def get_comments(self, obj):\n            comments_qs = Comment.objects.filter_parents_by_object(obj)\n            return CommentSerializer(comments_qs, many=True).data\n\n\nBy default all fields in profile model will be nested inside the user object in JSON response.\nThis can only happen if the profile attributes are defined in your ``settings.py``.\nIn case you would like to serialize particular fields in the profile model you should explicitly\ndeclare the ``COMMENT_PROFILE_API_FIELDS`` tuple inside your ``settings.py``:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        PROFILE_APP_NAME = 'accounts'\n        PROFILE_MODEL_NAME = 'userprofile'\n        # the field names below must be similar to your profile model fields\n        COMMENT_PROFILE_API_FIELDS = ('display_name', 'birth_date', 'image')\n\n\nComment API actions:\n--------------------\n\n**1- Retrieve the list of comments and associated replies to a given content type and object ID:**\n\nThis action can be performed by providing the url with data queries related to the content type.\n\nGet request accepts 3 params:\n\n\n- ``model_name``: is the model name of the content type that have comments associated with it.\n- ``app_name``: is the name of the app inside which this model is defined.\n- ``model_id``: is the id of an object of that model\n\n\n\nFor example if you are using axios to retrieve the comment list of second object (id=2) of a model (content type) called post inside the app(django app) post.\nyou can do the following:\n\n::\n\n    $ curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" 'http://localhost:8000/api/comments/?model_name=MODEL_NAME&model_id=ID&app_name=APP_NAME'\n\n\n**2- Create a comment or reply to an existing comment:**\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\n- ``model_name``: is the model name of the content type that have comments associated with it.\n- ``app_name``: the name of the app that contains that model.\n- ``model_id``: is the id of an object of that model\n- ``parent_id``: is 0 or **NOT PROVIDED** for parent comments and for reply comments must be the id of parent comment\n\n\nExample: posting a parent comment\n\n::\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -d \"content=CONTENT\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:8000/api/comments/create//?model_name=MODEL_NAME&model_id=ID&app_name=APP_NAME&parent_id=0\"\n\n\n**3- Update a comment:**\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\nThis action requires the ``comment.id`` that you want to update:\n\n\n::\n\n    $ curl -X PUT -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -d \"content=CONTENT\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/\n\n\n**4- Delete a comment:**\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\nThis action requires the ``comment.id`` that you want to delete:\n\n::\n\n    $ curl -X DELETE -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/\n\n\n**5- React to a comment:**\n\n``POST`` is the allowed method to perform a reaction on a comment.\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\nThis action requires the ``comment.id``. and,\n``reaction_type``: one of ``like`` or ``dislike``\n\n::\n\n   $ curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/react/REACTION_TYPE/\n\n\nPS: As in the UI, clicking the **liked** button will remove the reaction => unlike the comment. This behaviour is performed when repeating the same post request.\n\n\n**6- Report a comment**\n\nFlagging system must be enabled by adding the attribute ``COMMENT_FLAGS_ALLOWED`` to ``settings.py``. See `Enable Flagging`_\n\n``POST`` is the allowed method to report a comment.\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\nThis action requires the ``comment.id``.\n\n1. Set a flag:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    payload = {\n        'reason': REASON,  # number of the reason\n        'info': ''  # this is required if the reason is 100 ``Something else``\n    }\n\n::\n\n   $ curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"reason\":1, \"info\":\"\"}' http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/flag/\n\n\n2. Un-flag a comment:\n\nTo un-flag a FLAGGED comment, set reason value to `0` or remove the payload from the request.\n\n::\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/flag/\n\n\n**7- Change flagged comment state**\n\n``POST`` is the allowed method to report a comment.\n\nAuthorization must be provided as a TOKEN or USERNAME:PASSWORD.\n\nThis action requires comment admin or moderator privilege.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    payload = {\n        'state': 3  # accepted state is 3 (REJECTED) or 4 (RESOLVED) only\n    }\n\n::\n\n   $ curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"state\":3}' http://localhost:8000/api/comments/ID/flag/state/change/\n\nRepeating the same request and payload toggle the state to its original.\n\n**8- Confirm comment made by an anonymous users**\n\n``GET`` is the allowed method to confirm an anonymous comment.\n\nGet request accepts 3 params:\n\n\n- ``key``: is the encrypted key that contains the comment.\n\nExample:\n\n::\n    $ curl -X GET -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8000/api/comments/confirm/KEY/\n\nSince the key generated for each comment is unique, it can only be used once to verify. Any tampering with the key will result in a BAD HTTP request(400).\n\n\n.. _`Style Customization`:\n\nStyle Customization\n====================\n\n1- Default blocks:\n---------------------\n\nBS classes, pagination and some other template values can be now customized from within your templates directory as follows:\n\n    1.
