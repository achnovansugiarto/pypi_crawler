    "description": "django-comments-dab App - v1.3.0\n================================\n\n**dab stands for Django-Ajax-Bootstrap**\n\n``django-comments-dab`` is a commenting application for Django-powered\nwebsites.\n\nIt allows you to integrate commenting functionality with any model you\nhave e.g. blogs, pictures, etc…\n\n*List of actions you can do:*\n\n    1. Post a new comment. (Authenticated)\n\n    2. Reply to an existing comment. (Authenticated)\n\n    3. Edit a comment you posted. (Authenticated)\n\n    4. Delete a comment you posted. (Authenticated)\n\n\n- All actions are done by ajax - JQuery 3.2.1\n\n- Bootstrap 4.1.1 is used in comment templates for responsive design.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n\nRequirements:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    1. **django>=2.1.5**\n    2. **django-widget-tweaks==1.4.2**\n    3. **djangorestframework==3.8.2**  # for API Framework\n    4. **Bootstrap 4.1.1**\n    5. **jQuery 3.2.1**\n\n\nInstallation:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstallation is available via ``pip``\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install django-comments-dab\n\n\nor via source on github\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/radi85/Comment.git\n    $ cd Comment\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nSettings and urls:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    1. Add ``comment`` to your installed_apps in your ``settings.py`` file. It should be added after ``django.contrib.auth``. and,\n    2. Make sure that ``widget-tweaks`` is already included in installed_apps as well.\n    3. ``LOGIN_URL`` shall be defined in the settings.\n\nyour ``settings.py`` should look like the following:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        'django.contrib.admin',\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        ...\n        'widget_tweaks',\n        'comment',\n        'rest_framework',  # for API Framework\n        ..\n    )\n\n    LOGIN_URL = 'login'  # or your actual url\n\nIn your urls.py:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns(\n        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n        path('comment/', include('comment.urls')),\n        ...\n        path('api/', include('comment.api.urls')),  # for API Framework\n        ...\n    )\n\nMigrations:\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMigrate comment app:\n\n::\n\n    $ python manage.py migrate comment\n\n\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nStep 1\n~~~~~~\n\nIn your models.py add the field ``comments`` (Please note that field name\nmust be ``comments`` not ``comment``) to the model for which comments\nshould be added (e.g. Post) and **the appropriate imports** as shown below:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericRelation\n    from comment.models import Comment\n\n    class Post(models.Model):\n        author = models.ForeignKey(User)\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        body = models.TextField()\n        # the field name should be comments\n        comments = GenericRelation(Comment)\n\nStep 2\n~~~~~~\n\n``get_comments`` *tag uses 2 positional and 3 optional args*:\n\n    1. The instance of the model. (**positional**)\n    2. Request object. (**positional**)\n    3. oauth. (optional - Default is false)\n    4. paginate. (optional - Default is false)\n    5. cpp (number of Comments Per Page - Default is 10)\n\n\n1. Basics usage:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``include_static`` this tag will include required jquery and javascript file,\nif you already use jquery please make sure it is not the slim version which doesn't support ajax.\n``include_bootstrap`` tag is for bootstrap-4.1.1, if it’s already included\nin your project, get rid of this tag.\n\nIn your template (e.g. post-detail.html) add the following template tags where object is the instance of post model.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag\n    {% get_comments object request %}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object\n\n\n**Include static files:**\n\nThe comment app has three template tags for static files that the app requires.\nThese tags need to be included in the end of your base template.\n\n\n- **Case 1:** You already have jQuey in your project then the following tags shall be included below jQuery file:\n\n.. code:: html\n\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js\"></script>\n\n    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag\n\n    {% include_static %}  # Include comment.js file only.\n    {% include_bootstrap %}  # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project\n\n\n- **Case 2:** You don't have jQuery in your project then the following tags shall be included:\n\n.. code:: html\n\n    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag\n\n    {% include_static_jquery %}  # Include mini jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file.\n    {% include_bootstrap %}  # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project\n\n\n2. Advanced usage:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    **1. Add pagination:**\n\n    To add pagination to your comments, you need to pass two variables to the ``get_comments`` tag.\n    ``paginate`` must be set to ``True`` and set ``cpp`` var (number of comments per page - default is 10) to the desired number of comments per page.\n    e.g. If you would like to have 5 comments per page, the ``get_comments`` tag should look like this:\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag\n        {% get_comments object request paginate=True cpp=5 %}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object\n        {% include_bootstrap %} # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project\n        {% include_static %} # Include jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file\n\n\n\n    **2. Integrate existing profile app with comments app:**\n\n    If you have a profile model for the user and you would like to show the\n    profile image on each comment, you need to do these two steps:\n\n    - Declare ``PROFILE_APP_NAME`` and ``PROFILE_MODEL_NAME`` variables in your ``settings.py`` file.\n        (e.g if user profile app is called ``accounts`` and profile model is called ``UserProfile``)\n        Update your ``settings.py`` as follows:\n\n        .. code:: python\n\n            PROFILE_APP_NAME = 'accounts'\n            PROFILE_MODEL_NAME = 'UserProfile' # letter case insensitive\n\n\n\n    - Make sure that ``get_absolute_url`` method is defined in your profile model.\n        Update your ``user profile model`` as follows:\n\n        .. code:: python\n\n            from django.urls import reverse\n\n            class UserProfile(models.Model):\n                user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n                ...\n                ...\n\n                # this method must be defined for appropriate url mapping in comments section\n                def get_absolute_url(self):\n                    return reverse('profile_url_name')\n\n\nWeb API\n-------\n\ndjango-comments-dab uses django-rest-framework to expose a Web API that provides\ndevelopers with access to the same functionalities offered through the web user interface.\n\nThere are 5 methods available to perform the following actions:\n\n\n    1. Post a new comment. (Authenticated)\n\n    2. Reply to an existing comment. (Authenticated)\n\n    3. Edit a comment you posted. (Authenticated)\n\n    4. Delete a comment you posted. (Authenticated)\n\n    5. Retrieve the list of comments and associated replies to a given content type and object ID.\n\nThese actions are explained below.\n\nSetup:\n~~~~~~\n\nTo integrate the comment API in your content type (e.g Post model), in ``serializers.py``\nfor the Post model add comments field as shown below:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from rest_framework import serializers\n    from comment.models import Comment\n    from comment.api.serializers import CommentSerializer\n\n\n    class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n\n        comments = serializers.SerializerMethodField()\n\n        class Meta:\n            model = Post\n            fields = ('id',\n                      ...\n                      ...\n                      'comments')\n\n        def get_comments(self, obj):\n            comments_qs = Comment.objects.filter_by_object(obj)\n            return CommentSerializer(comments_qs, many=True).data\n\n\nBy default the image field from profile models will be included inside user object\nin JSON response. This can only happen if the profile attributes mentioned early are\ndefined in your ``settings.py``. In case you would like to serialize more fields from profile models\nyou need to explicitly declare the ``COMMENT_PROFILE_API_FIELDS`` tuple inside your ``settings.py``\nas follows:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        PROFILE_APP_NAME = 'accounts'\n        PROFILE_MODEL_NAME = 'userprofile'\n        # the field names below must be similar to your profile model fields\n        COMMENT_PROFILE_API_FIELDS = ('display_name', 'birth_date', 'image')\n\n\nComment API actions:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    **1- Retrieve the list of comments and associated replies to a given content type and object ID:**\n\n    This action can be performed by providing the url with data queries related to the content type.\n\n    Get request accepts 3 params:\n\n\n    - ``type``: is the model name of the content type that have comments associated with it.\n    - ``id``: is the id of an object of that model\n\n\n\n\n    For example if you are using axios to retrieve the comment list of second object (id=2) of a model (content type) called post.\n    you can do the following:\n\n\n    .. code:: javascript\n\n        axios ({\n            method: \"get\",\n            url: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/?type=post&id=2\",\n        })\n\n\n\n    **2- Post a comment and reply to an existing comment:**\n\n    Authorization must be provided in the headers.\n\n    The data queries provided with the url are as above with one more parameter:\n\n    - ``parent_id``: is 0 or **NOT PROVIDED** for parent comments and for reply comments must be the id of parent comment\n\n\n    Example: posting a parent comment\n\n    .. code:: javascript\n\n        axios({\n            method: \"post\",\n            url: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/create/?type=post&id=2&parent_id=0\",\n            data: {\n                content: \"Hello comments\"\n            },\n            headers: {\n                Accept: \"application/json\",\n                \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                Authorization: `Token ${token}`\n            }\n        })\n\n\n    **3- Update a comment:**\n\n    Authorization must be provided in the headers.\n\n    The url has no data queries in this action.\n\n    This action requires the ``comment id`` that you want to update:\n\n\n    .. code:: javascript\n\n        axios({\n            method: \"put\",\n            url: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/1\",\n            data: {\n                content: \"Update comment number 1 (id=1)\"\n            },\n            headers: {\n                Accept: \"application/json\",\n                \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                Authorization: `Token ${token}`\n            }\n        })\n\n\n    **4- Delete a comment:**\n\n    Authorization must be provided in the headers.\n\n    The url has no data queries in this action.\n\n    This action requires the ``comment id`` that you want to delete:\n\n\n    .. code:: javascript\n\n        axios({\n            method: \"delete\",\n            url: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/1\",\n            headers: {\n                Accept: \"application/json\",\n                \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                Authorization: `Token ${token}`\n            }\n        })\n\n\n\nStyle Customize:\n----------------\n\n1- Bootstrap classes:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBS class used in the default template can be now customized from within your templates directory as follows:\n\n    1. Create ``comment`` folder inside your templates directory.\n\n    2. Create new template file ``.html`` with the same name of the default template you wish to override BS classes in it.\n\n\nfor example to override the BS classes of comment and reply btn do the following:\n\ncreate ``templates/comment/create_comment.html``\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    {% extends \"comment/create_comment.html\" %}\n\n    {% block post_btn_cls %}\n    btn btn-primary btn-block btn-sm\n    {% endblock post_btn_cls %}\n\n`Read the Doc`_ for more info about template names and block tags name.\n\n.. _`Read the Doc`: https://django-comment-dab.readthedocs.io/\n\n\n2- CSS file:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to customize the default style of comments app , you can do the following steps:\n\n    1. Create a ``comment.css`` file inside your ``static/css`` directory.\n\n    2. The new created file will override the original file used in the app.",
