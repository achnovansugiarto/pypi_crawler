    "description": "Django Bread\n============\n\nDjango Bread is a Django app to help build BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit,\nAdd, Delete) views for Django models.\n\nIt helps with default templates, url generation, permissions, filters,\npagination, and more.\n\nThis is relatively stable. We're using it in production and have attempted\nto document the important parts, but feedback is welcome.\n\nBreaking change in 1.0.0\n------------------------\n\nVersion 1.0.0 includes a breaking change! If you're using the default\nview permissions, before upgrading, make sure you've\nmigrated your users and groups that have \"read_{model_name}\"\npermissions to also have \"view_{model_name}\".  From 1.0.0 on, that's the\ndefault permission a user needs to use the read views, because it's become the\nstandard Django permission for read-only access since Django 2.1.\n\nIf you're still on Django 2.0, don't upgrade django-bread until you\ncan get to at least Django 2.1. (Hopefully that's not the case, since\nDjango 2.0 has been out of support since April 1, 2019.)\n\n\nSupported versions\n------------------\n\nDjango: 2.2, 3.0, 3.1\nPython: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\n\nFor Python 2.7 and/or Django 1.11 support, the 0.5 release series is identical (features-wise)\nto 0.6 and is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/django-bread/#history\n\n\nMaintainer Information\n----------------------\n\nWe use Github Actions to lint (using pre-commit, black, isort, and flake8),\ntest (using tox and tox-gh-actions), calculate coverage (using coverage), and build\ndocumentation (using sphinx).\n\nWe have a local script to do these actions locally, named ``maintain.sh``::\n\n  $ ./maintain.sh\n\nA Github Action workflow also builds and pushes a new package to PyPI whenever a new\nRelease is created in Github. This uses a project-specific PyPI token, as described in\nthe `PyPI documentation here <https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken>`_. That token has been\nsaved in the ``PYPI_PASSWORD`` settings for this repo, but has not been saved anywhere\nelse so if it is needed for any reason, the current one should be deleted and a new one\ngenerated.\n\nAs always, be sure to bump the version in ``bread/__init__.py`` before creating a\nRelease, so that the proper version gets pushed to PyPI.\n\n\nQuestions or Issues?\n--------------------\n\nIf you have questions, issues or requests for improvements please let us know on\n`Github <https://github.com/caktus/django_bread/issues>`_.\n\nDevelopment sponsored by `Caktus Consulting Group, LLC\n<https://www.caktusgroup.com/services>`_.\n\n\n",
