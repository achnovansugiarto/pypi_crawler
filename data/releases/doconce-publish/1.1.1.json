    "description": "# Publish: A Bibliographic Reference System\n\n## Overview\n\nPublish may be used for handling publication lists for research\ninstitutions and departments, or for individual researchers. Publish\nimports publication metadata (title, author, year of publication etc),\nvalidates the imported data against a database of known venues, checks\nfor missing attributes, corrects common errors etc, and allows simple\nfiltering and generation of publication lists.\n\nFor further information, refer to the Publish User Manual available in\nthe subdirectory doc/manual/ of this source tree.\n\n## Installation\n\nPublish is distributed on PyPi as publish-doconce, meaning that it can be installed with: \n\n```\npip install publish-doconce\n```\n\nTo install Publish from this repository, simply type\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Dependencies:\n\nThis version of Publish requires Python 3.6. Publish is not supported but probably still works on Python >= 2.6 (only tested for 2.7) with the levenshtein, future, and lxml modules installed:\n\n```\npip install python-Levenshtein\npip install future\npip install lxml\n```\n\n## Author\n\nPublish was originally developed and implemented by\nAnna Logg <anna@loggsystems.se> at Logg Systems.\nIt is currently maintained by Anders Logg <logg@chalmers.se>.\n\n\n\n",
