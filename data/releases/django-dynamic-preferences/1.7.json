Please upgrade to 1.3 as\n    soon as possible and do not use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\nDynamic-preferences is a Django app, BSD-licensed, designed to help you manage your project settings. While most of the time,\na `settings.py` file is sufficient, there are some situations where you need something more flexible such as:\n\n* per-user settings (or, generally speaking, per instance settings)\n* settings change without server restart\n\nFor per-instance settings, you could actually store them in some kind of profile model. However, it means that every time you want to add a new setting, you need to add a new column to the profile DB table. Not very efficient.\n\nDynamic-preferences allow you to register settings (a.k.a. preferences) in a declarative way. Preferences values are serialized before storage in database, and automatically deserialized when you need them.\n\nWith dynamic-preferences, you can update settings on the fly, through django's admin or custom forms, without restarting your application.\n\nThe project is tested and work under Python 2.7 and 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, with django >=1.8.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Simple to setup\n* Admin integration\n* Forms integration\n* Bundled with global and per-user preferences\n* Can be extended to other models if need (e.g. per-site preferences)\n* Integrates with django caching mechanisms to improve performance\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe full documentation is at https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.org.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee http://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html\n\nCredits\n\n+++++++\n\nContributors\n\n------------\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute! \n\n.. image:: https://opencollective.com/django-dynamic-preferences/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false\n\nBackers\n\n-------\n\nThank you to all our backers! `Become a backer`__.\n\n.. image:: https://opencollective.com/django-dynamic-preferences/backers.svg?width=890\n    :target: https://opencollective.com/django-dynamic-preferences#backers\n\n__ Backer_\n.. _Backer: https://opencollective.com/django-dynamic-preferences#backer\n\nSponsors\n\n--------\n\nSupport us by becoming a sponsor.

To ensure compatibility with django 2\nand better namespacing, you should update any references to those urls as described below:\n\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| Old url                             | New url                             |\n+=====================================+=====================================+\n| dynamic_preferences.global          | dynamic_preferences:global          |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| dynamic_preferences.global.section  | dynamic_preferences:global.section  |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| dynamic_preferences.user            | dynamic_preferences:user            |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| dynamic_preferences.user.section    | dynamic_preferences:user.section    |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+\n\n\nMigration cleanup\n-----------------\n\nThis version includes a proper fix for migration issues.\nFull background is available at https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/142,\nbut here is the gist of it:\n\n1. Early versions of dynamic_preferences included the user and global preferences models\n   in the same app\n2. The community requested a way to disable user preferences. The only way to do that\n   was to move the user preference model in a dedicated app (dynamic_preferences_user\n3. A migration was written to handle that transparently, but this was not actually possible\n   to have something that worked for both existing and new installations\n4. Thus, we ended up with issues such as #140 or #141, inconsistent db state, tables\n   lying around in the database, etc.\n\nI'd like to apologize to everyone impacted. By trying to make 3. completely transparent to everyone and\navoid a manual migration step for new installations, I actually made things worse.\n\nThis release should fix all that: any remains of the user app was removed from the main\napp migrations. For any new user, it will be like nothing happened.\n\nFor existing installations with user preferences disabled, there is nothing to do,\napart from deleting the `dynamic_preferences_users_userpreferencemodel` table in your database.\n\nFor existing installations with user preferences enabled, there is nothing to do. You should have\n``'dynamic_preferences.users.apps.UserPreferencesConfig'`` in your installed apps. If ``python manage.py migrate``\nfails with ``django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"dynamic_preferences_users_userpreferencemodel\" already exists``,\nthis probably means you are upgrading for a really old release. In such event, simply skip the initial migration for the\n``dynamic_preferences_user`` app by running ``python manage.py migrate dynamic_preferences_users 0001 --fake``.\n\nMany thanks to all people who helped clearing this mess, especially @czlee.\n\n1.5.1 (06-03-2018)\n******************\n\nThis is a minor bugfix release:\n\n* Get proper PreferenceModelsRegistry when preference is proxy model (#137)\n* Add missing `format()` to IntegerSerializer exception text (#138)\n* Add some attributes to PerInstancePreferenceAdmin (#135)\n\nContributors:\n\n* @czlee\n* @danie1k\n\n1.5 (16-12-2017)\n******************\n\nFrom now on, django-dynamic-preferences should fully support Django 2.0.\nThis release should be fully backward-compatible with previous versions\nof the module.\n\nYou will still have to upgrade your own code to work with Django 2, like\nadding on_delete option to your ForeignKey fields.\n\n* removed typo in API code that could cause a crash (#127)\n* added on_dete=models.CASCADE to migrations for Django 2.0 compatibility (#129 and #131)\n* Duration, date and datetime serialization issue in rest framework (#115)\n\nContributors:\n\n* @rvignesh89\n* @zamai\n\n\n1.4.2 (06-11-2017)\n******************\n\n* Fix #121: reverted Section import missing from dynamic_preferences.types\n\nContributors:\n\n* @okolimar\n* @swalladge\n\n\n1.4.1 (03-11-2017)\n******************\n\n* Section verbose name and filter in django admin (#114)\n* Fixed wrong import in Quickstart documentation (#113)\n* Fix #111: use path as returned by storage save method (#112)\n\nContributors:\n\n* @okolimar\n* @swalladge\n\n\n1.4 (15-10-2017)\n******************\n\n* Fix #8: we now have date, datetime and duration preferences\n* Fix #108: Dropped tests and guaranteed compatibility with django 1.8 and 1.9, though\n* Fix #103: bugged filtering of user preferences via REST API\n* Fix #78: removed ``create_default_per_instance_preferences``.\n  This is *not* considered a backward-incompatible change as this method did nothing at all\n  and was not documented\n\nContributors:\n\n* @rvignesh89\n* @haroon-sheikh\n\n\n1.3.3 (25-09-2017)\n******************\n\n* Fix #97 where the API serializer could crash during preference update because of incomplete parsing\n\nContributors:\n\n* @rvignesh89\n\n1.3.2 (11-09-2017)\n******************\n\n* Should fix Python 3.3 complaints in CI, also add tests on Python 3.6 (#94)\n* Fixed #75: Fix checkpreferences command that was not deleting obsolete preferences anymore (#93)\n* Retrieve existing preferences in bulk (#92)\n* Cache values when queried in all() (#91)\n\nContributors:\n\n* @czlee\n\n1.3.1 (30-07-2017)\n******************\n\n- Fix #84: serialization error for preferences with None value (@swalladge)\n- More documentation about preferences form fields\n\n1.3 (03-07-2017)\n*******************\n\nThis release fix a critical bug in 1.2 that can result in data loss.\n\nPlease upgrade to 1.3 as soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\n1.2 (06-07-2017)\n*******************\n\n.. warning::\n\n    There is a critical bug in this that can result in dataloss. Please upgrade to 1.3 as\n    soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\n- important performance improvements (less database and cache queries)\n- A brand new `REST API <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html>`_ based on Django REST Framework, to interact with preferences (this is an optionnal, opt-in feature)\n- A new `FilePreference <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preference_types.html#dynamic_preferences.types.FilePreference>`_ [original work by @macolo]\n\n1.1.1 (11-05-2017)\n*******************\n\nBugfix release to restore disabled user preferences admin (#77).\n\n1.1 (06-03-2017)\n*****************\n\n* Fixed #49 and #71 by passing full section objects in templates (and not just the section identifiers). This means it's easier to write template that use sections, for example if you want have i18n in your project and want to display the translated section's name. URL reversing for sections is also more reliable in templates. If you subclassed `PreferenceRegistry`  to implement your own preference class and use the built-in templates, you need to add a ``section_url_namespace`` attribute to your registry class to benefit from the new URL reversing.\n\n[Major release] 1.0 (21-02-2017)\n***********************************\n\nDynamic-preferences was release more than two years ago, and since then, more than 20 feature and bugfixe releases have been published.\nBut even after two years the project was still advertised as in Alpha-state on PyPi, and  the tags used for the releases, were implicitly saying that the project was not production-ready.\n\nToday, we're changing that by releasing the first major version of dynamic-preferences, the ``1.0`` release. We will stick to semantic versioning and keep backward compatibility until the next major version.\n\nDynamic-preferences is already used in various production applications .The implemented features are stable, working, and address many of the uses cases the project was designed for:\n\n- painless and efficient global configuration for your project\n- painless and efficient per-user (or any other model) settings\n- ease-of-use, both for end-user (via the admin interface) and developpers (settings are easy to create and to manage)\n- more than decent performance, thanks to caching\n\nBy making a major release, we want to show that the project is trustworthy and, in the end, to attract new users and develop the community around it. Development will goes on as before, with an increased focus on stability and backward compatibility.\n\n**Because of the major version switch, some dirt was removed from the code, and manual intervention is required for the upgrade. Please have a for the detailed instructions:** https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html\n\nThanks to all the people who contributed over the years by reporting bugs, asking for new features, working on the documentation or on implementing solutions!\n\n0.8.4 (10-01-2017)\n******************\n\nThis version is an emergency release to restore backward compatibility that was broken in 0.8.3, as\ndescribed in issue #67. Please upgrade as soon as possible if you use 0.8.3.\n\nSpecial thanks to [czlee](https://github.com/czlee) for reporting this!\n\n\n0.8.3 (06-01-2017) (**DO NOT USE: BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**)\n**********************************************************\n\n**This release introduced by mistake a backward incompatible change (commit 723f2e).**\n**Please upgrade to 0.8.4 or higher to restore backward compatibility with earlier versions**\n\nThis is a small bugfix release.
