Please upgrade to 1.3 as\n    soon as possible and do not use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\nDynamic-preferences is a Django app, BSD-licensed, designed to help you manage your project settings. While most of the time,\na `settings.py` file is sufficient, there are some situations where you need something more flexible such as:\n\n* per-user settings (or, generally speaking, per instance settings)\n* settings change without server restart\n\nFor per-instance settings, you could actually store them in some kind of profile model. However, it means that every time you want to add a new setting, you need to add a new column to the profile DB table. Not very efficient.\n\nDynamic-preferences allow you to register settings (a.k.a. preferences) in a declarative way. Preferences values are serialized before storage in database, and automatically deserialized when you need them.\n\nWith dynamic-preferences, you can update settings on the fly, through django's admin or custom forms, without restarting your application.\n\nThe project is tested and work under Python 2.7 and 3.4, with django >=1.7.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Simple to setup\n* Admin integration\n* Forms integration\n* Bundled with global and per-user preferences\n* Can be extended to other models if need (e.g. per-site preferences)\n* Integrates with django caching mechanisms to improve performance\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe full documentation is at https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.org.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee http://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.3.1 (30-07-2017)\n******************\n\n- Fix #84: serialization error for preferences with None value (@swalladge)\n- More documentation about preferences form fields\n\n1.3 (03-07-2017)\n*******************\n\nThis release fix a critical bug in 1.2 that can result in data loss.\n\nPlease upgrade to 1.3 as soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\n1.2 (06-07-2017)\n*******************\n\n.. warning::\n\n    There is a critical bug in this that can result in dataloss. Please upgrade to 1.3 as\n    soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.\n\n- important performance improvements (less database and cache queries)\n- A brand new `REST API <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html>`_ based on Django REST Framework, to interact with preferences (this is an optionnal, opt-in feature)\n- A new `FilePreference <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preference_types.html#dynamic_preferences.types.FilePreference>`_ [original work by @macolo]\n\n1.1.1 (11-05-2017)\n*******************\n\nBugfix release to restore disabled user preferences admin (#77).\n\n1.1 (06-03-2017)\n*****************\n\n* Fixed #49 and #71 by passing full section objects in templates (and not just the section identifiers). This means it's easier to write template that use sections, for example if you want have i18n in your project and want to display the translated section's name. URL reversing for sections is also more reliable in templates. If you subclassed `PreferenceRegistry`  to implement your own preference class and use the built-in templates, you need to add a ``section_url_namespace`` attribute to your registry class to benefit from the new URL reversing.\n\n[Major release] 1.0 (21-02-2017)\n***********************************\n\nDynamic-preferences was release more than two years ago, and since then, more than 20 feature and bugfixe releases have been published.\nBut even after two years the project was still advertised as in Alpha-state on PyPi, and  the tags used for the releases, were implicitly saying that the project was not production-ready.\n\nToday, we're changing that by releasing the first major version of dynamic-preferences, the ``1.0`` release. We will stick to semantic versioning and keep backward compatibility until the next major version.\n\nDynamic-preferences is already used in various production applications .The implemented features are stable, working, and address many of the uses cases the project was designed for:\n\n- painless and efficient global configuration for your project\n- painless and efficient per-user (or any other model) settings\n- ease-of-use, both for end-user (via the admin interface) and developpers (settings are easy to create and to manage)\n- more than decent performance, thanks to caching\n\nBy making a major release, we want to show that the project is trustworthy and, in the end, to attract new users and develop the community around it. Development will goes on as before, with an increased focus on stability and backward compatibility.\n\n**Because of the major version switch, some dirt was removed from the code, and manual intervention is required for the upgrade. Please have a for the detailed instructions:** https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html\n\nThanks to all the people who contributed over the years by reporting bugs, asking for new features, working on the documentation or on implementing solutions!\n\n0.8.4 (10-01-2017)\n******************\n\nThis version is an emergency release to restore backward compatibility that was broken in 0.8.3, as\ndescribed in issue #67. Please upgrade as soon as possible if you use 0.8.3.\n\nSpecial thanks to [czlee](https://github.com/czlee) for reporting this!\n\n\n0.8.3 (06-01-2017) (**DO NOT USE: BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**)\n**********************************************************\n\n**This release introduced by mistake a backward incompatible change (commit 723f2e).**\n**Please upgrade to 0.8.4 or higher to restore backward compatibility with earlier versions**\n\nThis is a small bugfix release.
