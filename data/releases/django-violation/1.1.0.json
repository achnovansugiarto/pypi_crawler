    "description": "# django-violation\n\n## Description\n\nDescription Django-violation is a very simple app which serves the purpose of violation. It can easily be plugged into any django app of your choice with just little line of code/customization but with robust function.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n>> pip install django-violation\n```\n\n## Features\n\ndjango-violation is shipped with basic features that is needed for reporting / flagging an item, post, image, user, thread etc as invalid.\n\nAmong some of its basic features are:\n\n- An item cannot be submitted for violation by same person.\n- Built-in django admin panel.\n- Ability to redisplay rules that have been submitted by various users.\n- Can be plugged with any django app.\n- Highly customizable.\n\n**Future implementations**\n\n- Adding a UI interface.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python >= 3.5\n- Django >= 2.2\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Add package to list of your already available django apps in settings.py\n\n   Code:\n\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\n...\n\n'violation',\n\n]\n```\n2. Run database migration to sync preset violation that the app ships with.\n  Code: \n\n  ```\n  >> python manage.py migrate\n  ```\n\n  \n\n3. Login your project admin panel and you should see VIOLATION added menu.\n\n4. Next is to write a view code to load object you will like report.\n\n   ### CBV\n\n   For Lovers of class views, who want to customize to the core,  import `BaseViolationViewMixin`\n\n   i.e. `from violation.viewmixins.violation import BaseViolationMixin`\n\n   Inherit the view class and supply other `CreateView` parameters other than form_class.\n\n   Do something similar to this\n\n   ```\n   from violation.views.violation import BaseViolationView\n   \n   class ThreadViolationView(BaseViolationView):\n       model = YourModelClass\n    template_name = ''\n   ```\n\n   It's worth noting that `BaseViolationView` ancestors are `BaseViolationMixin` and `CreateView`\n\n   ### FBV\n\n   Function base view user can follow this code logic\n\n   ```\n   from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404\n   \n   from violation.forms.violation import ViolationForm\n   \n   from .models import Thread # where this a an imaginary thread you want to report\n   \n   TEMPLATE_URL = 'apps/threads'\n   \n   def report_thread(request, pk):\n       template_name = f'{TEMPLATE_URL}/report_thread.html'\n       thread = get_object_or_404(Thread, pk=pk)\n       form_kwargs = {\n           'request': request,\n           'object': thread,\n       }\n       if request.method == 'POST':\n           form = ViolationForm(data=request.POST, **form_kwargs)\n           if form.is_valid():\n               form.save()\n       else:\n           form = ViolationForm(**form_kwargs)\n       context = {\n           'form': form,\n           'thread': thread\n       }\n       return render(request, template_name, context=context)\n   ```\n\n> Most importantly, it is worth noting that request and object keywords must be passed to form in your view.\n\nFor further customization, see project source code in [github](http://github.com/adepeter/django-violations).\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Lack of links and UI.\n- Limited info on how to fully use.\n\n## Versioning\n\nSemVer is the versioning style utilized for this app. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository [releases](https://github.com/adepeter/django-violations/releases).\n\n## License\n\nThis work uses MIT license\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n- A big heart to [Samaila Bala](http://github.com/samailabala).\n- Thanks to Stephen Efe.",
