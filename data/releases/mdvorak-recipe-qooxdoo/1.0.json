    "description": "=======================\nQooxdoo Buildout Recipe\n=======================\n\nBuildout recipe, that runs Qooxdoo generator script. It requires Qooxdoo SDK to run.\n\nIt supports two recipes, default (script) and run. Default generates script in your bin directory, so you can run the generator manually. Run runs the commands at the time of buildout processing, automating the process completely.\n\nParameters\n==========\n\n* **script** - Name of the written script. Defaults to part name. Available only for default (script) recipe. Ignored by run recipe.\n* **commands** - Command executed by the generator. It must be exported by project config. If empty, either command-line arguments or default command from ``config.json`` will be used.\n* **config** - Path to the project configuration file, or directory containing ``config.json`` file.\n* **qooxdoo-sdk** - Path to the qooxdoo sdk. Fallbacks to ``${buildout:qooxdoo-sdk}`` variable. SDK must exist. Corresponds to ``QOOXDOO_PATH`` macro.\n* **cache** - Qooxdoo cache path. If empty, ``${buildout:cache-directory}`` will be used. If neither is specified, Qooxdoo default will be used. It corresponds to ``CACHE`` macro.\n* **let** - Qooxdoo environmental variables, as are under ``\"let\"`` keyword in ``config.json``. It should be in ``key:value`` format since Qooxdoo generator expects it. It may contain multiple pairs. Optional.\n* **remove-dirs** - Directories that should be removed on script execution. Path is relative to buildout root. This can also remove files. Optional.\n* **create-dirs** - Directories that should be created on script execution. Path is relative to buildout root. Useful for jobs that require some path to exist. Optional.\n* **clean-dirs** - Directories which contents should be removed on script execution. Path is relative to buildout root. Useful for jobs that require some path to exist and yet you want their content to be recreated every time (like images creation). Optional.\n\nOptions ``commands`` and ``config`` can contain multiple entries. Projects are then built sequentially for each project, with each command executed as standalone process.\n\nWhen ``commnads`` is omitted and command-line arguments are used as commands, they are split and executed sequentially as well. Therefore you can run e.g. ``translate lint build`` in one go, which generator itself does not support.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nExample buildout.cfg::\n\n    [buildout]\n    parts =\n      qooxdoo-sdk\n      translate\n      qx\n      info\n\n    qooxdoo-sdk = ${qooxdoo-sdk:destination}\n    cache-directory = cache\n\n    [qooxdoo-sdk]\n    recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download\n    url = http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-current/2.1/qooxdoo-2.1-sdk.zip\n    destination = qooxdoo-sdk\n    strip-top-level-dir = true\n\n    [translate]\n    recipe = mdvorak.recipe.qooxdoo\n    commands = translation\n    config = src/config.json\n\n    [qx]\n    recipe = mdvorak.recipe.qooxdoo\n    config = src/config.json\n\n    [info]\n    recipe = mdvorak.recipe.qooxdoo:run\n    commands = info\n    config = src/config.json\n\nYou can then execute translation job with ``./bin/translate``, or any command using ``./bin/qx``. Try ``./bin/qx info`` to see how is Qooxdoo configured.\nIn addition to that, info section is run during buildout execution, displaying Qooxdoo configuration immediately. This is not very useful, it's just an example.\n\nCreate scripts for any jobs (and job sequences) you want.",
