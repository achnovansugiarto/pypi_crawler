It provides\nsafe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\n1.0.3 (2006-08-08)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Element.replace(old, new) method to replace a subelement by another one\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Crash when mixing elements from XSLT results into other trees\n\n* Copying/deepcopying did not work for ElementTree objects\n\n* Setting an attribute to a non-string value did not raise an exception\n\n* Element.remove() deleted the tail text from the removed Element",
