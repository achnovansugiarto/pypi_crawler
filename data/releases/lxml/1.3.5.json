    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix\n\n1.3.5 (2007-10-22)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* lxml.etree could crash when adding more than 10000 namespaces to a\n  document\n\n* lxml failed to serialise namespace declarations of elements other than the\n  root node of a tree",
