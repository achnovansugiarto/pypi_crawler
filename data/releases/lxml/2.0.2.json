    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.2 (2008-02-22)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Support passing ``base_url`` to file parser functions to override\n  the filename of the file(-like) object.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* The prefix for objectify's pytype namespace was missing from the set\n  of default prefixes.\n\n* Memory leak in Schematron (fixed only for libxml2 2.6.31+).\n\n* Error type names in RelaxNG were reported incorrectly.\n\n* Slice deletion bug fixed in objectify.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* Enabled doctests for some Python modules (especially ``lxml.html``).\n\n* Add a ``method`` argument to ``lxml.html.tostring()``\n  (``method=\"xml\"`` for XHTML output).\n\n* Make it clearer that methods like ``lxml.html.fromstring()`` take a\n  ``base_url`` argument.",
