    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,\nyou can get it from the github repository at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home\npage.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will\ninstall lxml from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have\nan appropriate version of Cython installed.\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-3.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==3.0bugfix`` will install\nthe unreleased branch state from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-3.0#egg=lxml-3.0bugfix\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this\nrequires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\n\n3.0.1 (2012-10-14)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* LP#1065924: Element proxies could disappear during garbage collection\n  in PyPy without proper cleanup.\n\n* GH#71: Failure to work with libxml2 2.6.x.\n\n* LP#1065139: static MacOS-X build failed in Py3.\n\nOther changes\n-------------",

This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

      "details": "NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",
