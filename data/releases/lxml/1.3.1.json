    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\r\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\r\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\r\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\r\n\r\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this\r\nversion from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix\r\n\r\n1.3.1 (2007-07-02)\r\n==================\r\n\r\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS VERSION, TRY 1.3.2 OR LATER INSTEAD !\r\n\r\nFeatures added\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* objectify.DataElement now supports setting values from existing data\r\n  elements (not just plain Python types) and reuses defined namespaces etc.\r\n\r\n* E-factory support for lxml.objectify (``objectify.E``)\r\n\r\nBugs fixed\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* Better way to prevent crashes in Element proxy cleanup code\r\n\r\n* objectify.DataElement didn't set up None value correctly\r\n\r\n* objectify.DataElement didn't check the value against the provided type hints\r\n\r\n* Reference-counting bug in ``Element.attrib.pop()``",
