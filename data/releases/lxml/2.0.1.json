    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.1 (2008-02-13)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Child iteration in ``lxml.pyclasslookup``.\n\n* Loads of new docstrings reflect the signature of functions and\n  methods to make them visible in API docs and ``help()``\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* The module ``lxml.html.builder`` was duplicated as\n  ``lxml.htmlbuilder``\n\n* Form elements would return None for ``form.fields.keys()`` if there\n  was an unnamed input field.  Now unnamed input fields are completely\n  ignored.\n\n* Setting an element slice in objectify could insert slice-overlapping\n  elements at the wrong position.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* The generated API documentation was cleaned up and disburdened from\n  non-public classes etc.\n\n* The previously public module ``lxml.html.setmixin`` was renamed to\n  ``lxml.html._setmixin`` as it is not an official part of lxml.  If\n  you want to use it, feel free to copy it over to your own source\n  base.\n\n* Passing ``--with-xslt-config=/path/to/xslt-config`` to setup.py will\n  override the ``xslt-config`` script that is used to determine the C\n  compiler options.",
