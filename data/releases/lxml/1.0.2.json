It provides\nsafe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\n1.0.2 (2006-06-27)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Support for setting a custom default Element class as opposed to namespace\n  specific classes (which still override the default class)\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Rare exceptions in Python list functions were not handled\n\n* Parsing accepted unicode strings with XML encoding declaration in certain\n  cases\n\n* Parsing 8-bit encoded strings from StringIO objects raised an exception\n\n* Module function ``initThread()`` was removed - useless (and never worked)\n\n* XSLT and parser exception messages include the error line number",
