    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the project home page or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0 (2008-02-01)\n================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Passing the ``unicode`` type as ``encoding`` to ``tostring()`` will\n  serialise to unicode.  The ``tounicode()`` function is now\n  deprecated.\n\n* ``XMLSchema()`` and ``RelaxNG()`` can parse from StringIO.\n\n* ``makeparser()`` function in ``lxml.objectify`` to create a new\n  parser with the usual objectify setup.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\nOther changes\n-------------",
