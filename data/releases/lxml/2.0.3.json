    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.3 (2008-03-26)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* soupparser.parse() allows passing keyword arguments on to\n  BeautifulSoup.\n\n* ``fromstring()`` method in ``lxml.html.soupparser``.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* ``lxml.html.diff`` didn't treat empty tags properly (e.g.,\n  ``<br>``).\n\n* Handle entity replacements correctly in target parser.\n\n* Crash when using ``iterparse()`` with XML Schema validation.\n\n* The BeautifulSoup parser (soupparser.py) did not replace entities,\n  which made them turn up in text content.\n\n* Attribute assignment of custom PyTypes in objectify could fail to\n  correctly serialise the value to a string.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* ``lxml.html.ElementSoup`` was replaced by a new module\n  ``lxml.html.soupparser`` with a more consistent API.  The old module\n  remains for compatibility with ElementTree's own ElementSoup module.\n\n* Setting the XSLT_CONFIG and XML2_CONFIG environment variables at\n  build time will let setup.py pick up the ``xml2-config`` and\n  ``xslt-config`` scripts from the supplied path name.\n\n* Passing ``--with-xml2-config=/path/to/xml2-config`` to setup.py will\n  override the ``xml2-config`` script that is used to determine the C\n  compiler options.  The same applies for the ``--with-xslt-config``\n  option.",
