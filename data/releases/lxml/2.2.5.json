    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\r\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\r\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\r\n\r\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\r\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\r\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\r\n\r\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\r\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\r\navailable at\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2 .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.2bugfix`` will install\r\nthe unreleased branch state from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2#egg=lxml-2.2bugfix\r\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.\r\n\r\n2.2.5 (2010-02-28)\r\n==================\r\n\r\nFeatures added\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* Support for running XSLT extension elements on the input root node\r\n  (e.g. in a template matching on \"/\").\r\n\r\nBugs fixed\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* Crash in XPath evaluation when reading smart strings from a document\r\n  other than the original context document.\r\n\r\n* Support recent versions of html5lib by not requiring its\r\n  ``XHTMLParser`` in ``htmlparser.py`` anymore.\r\n\r\n* Manually instantiating the custom element classes in\r\n  ``lxml.objectify`` could crash.\r\n\r\n* Invalid XML text characters were not rejected by the API when they\r\n  appeared in unicode strings directly after non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\n* lxml.html.open_http_urllib() did not work in Python 3.\r\n\r\n* The functions ``strip_tags()`` and ``strip_elements()`` in\r\n  ``lxml.etree`` did not remove all occurrences of a tag in all cases.\r\n\r\n* Crash in XSLT extension elements when the XSLT context node is not\r\n  an element.",
