    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.7 (2008-06-20)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Pickling ``ElementTree`` objects in lxml.objectify.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Descending dot-separated classes in CSS selectors were not resolved\n  correctly.\n\n* ``ElementTree.parse()`` didn't handle target parser result.\n\n* Potential threading problem in XInclude.\n\n* Crash in Element class lookup classes when the __init__() method of\n  the super class is not called from Python subclasses.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* Non-ASCII characters in attribute values are no longer escaped on\n  serialisation.",
