    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.11 (2008-12-12)\n===================\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Crash when using an XPath evaluator in multiple threads.",

It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",
