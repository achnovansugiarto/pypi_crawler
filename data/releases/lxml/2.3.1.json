    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\r\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\r\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\r\n\r\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\r\n<http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at\r\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\r\n\r\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,\r\nyou can get it from the github repository at\r\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to\r\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home\r\npage.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will\r\ninstall lxml from\r\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have\r\nan appropriate version of Cython installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\r\navailable at\r\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-2.3 .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.3bugfix`` will install\r\nthe unreleased branch state from\r\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-2.3#egg=lxml-2.3bugfix\r\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this\r\nrequires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\r\n\r\n2.3.1 (2011-09-25)\r\n==================\r\n\r\nFeatures added\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* New option ``kill_tags`` in ``lxml.html.clean`` to remove specific\r\n  tags and their content (i.e. their whole subtree).\r\n\r\n* ``pi.get()`` and ``pi.attrib`` on processing instructions to parse\r\n  pseudo-attributes from the text content of processing instructions.\r\n\r\n* ``lxml.get_include()`` returns a list of include paths that can be\r\n  used to compile external C code against lxml.etree.  This is\r\n  specifically required for statically linked lxml builds when code\r\n  needs to compile against the exact same header file versions as lxml\r\n  itself.\r\n\r\n* ``Resolver.resolve_file()`` takes an additional option\r\n  ``close_file`` that configures if the file(-like) object will be\r\n  closed after reading or not.  By default, the file will be closed,\r\n  as the user is not expected to keep a reference to it.\r\n\r\nBugs fixed\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* HTML cleaning didn't remove 'data:' links.\r\n\r\n* The html5lib parser integration now uses the 'official'\r\n  implementation in html5lib itself, which makes it work with newer\r\n  releases of the library.\r\n\r\n* In ``lxml.sax``, ``endElementNS()`` could incorrectly reject a plain\r\n  tag name when the corresponding start event inferred the same plain\r\n  tag name to be in the default namespace.\r\n\r\n* When an open file-like object is passed into ``parse()`` or\r\n  ``iterparse()``, the parser will no longer close it after use.  This\r\n  reverts a change in lxml 2.3 where all files would be closed.  It is\r\n  the users responsibility to properly close the file(-like) object,\r\n  also in error cases.\r\n\r\n* Assertion error in lxml.html.cleaner when discarding top-level elements.\r\n\r\n* In lxml.cssselect, use the xpath 'A//B' (short for\r\n  'A/descendant-or-self::node()/B') instead of 'A/descendant::B' for the css\r\n  descendant selector ('A B'). This makes a few edge cases to be consistent\r\n  with the selector behavior in WebKit and Firefox, and makes more css\r\n  expressions valid location paths (for use in xsl:template match).\r\n\r\n* In lxml.html, non-selected ``<option>`` tags no longer show up in the\r\n  collected form values.\r\n\r\n* Adding/removing ``<option>`` values to/from a multiple select form\r\n  field properly selects them and unselects them.\r\n\r\nOther changes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* Static builds can specify the download directory with the\r\n  ``--download-dir`` option.",
