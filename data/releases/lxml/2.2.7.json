    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\navailable at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.2bugfix`` will install\nthe unreleased branch state from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2#egg=lxml-2.2bugfix\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.\n\n2.2.7 (2010-07-24)\n==================\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Crash in XSLT when generating text-only result documents with a\n  stylesheet created in a different thread.",
