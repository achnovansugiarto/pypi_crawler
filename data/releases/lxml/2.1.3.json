    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.1 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.1bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.1#egg=lxml-2.1bugfix\n\n2.1.3 (2008-11-17)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Ref-count leaks when lxml enters a try-except statement while an\n  outside exception lives in sys.exc_*(). This was due to a problem in\n  Cython, not lxml itself.\n\n* Parser Unicode decoding errors could get swallowed by other\n  exceptions.\n\n* Name/import errors in some Python modules.\n\n* Internal DTD subsets that did not specify a system or public ID were\n  not serialised and did not appear in the docinfo property of\n  ElementTrees.\n\n* Fix a pre-Py3k warning when parsing from a gzip file in Py2.6.\n\n* Test suite fixes for libxml2 2.7.\n\n* Resolver.resolve_string() did not work for non-ASCII byte strings.\n\n* Resolver.resolve_file() was broken.\n\n* Overriding the parser encoding didn't work for many encodings.\n\nOther changes\n-------------",

      "details": "NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",
