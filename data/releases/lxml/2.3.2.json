    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,\nyou can get it from the github repository at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home\npage.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will\ninstall lxml from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have\nan appropriate version of Cython installed.\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-2.3 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.3bugfix`` will install\nthe unreleased branch state from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-2.3#egg=lxml-2.3bugfix\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this\nrequires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\n\n2.3.2 (2011-11-11)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* ``lxml.objectify.deannotate()`` has a new boolean option\n  ``cleanup_namespaces`` to remove the objectify namespace\n  declarations (and generally clean up the namespace declarations)\n  after removing the type annotations.\n\n* ``lxml.objectify`` gained its own ``SubElement()`` function as a\n  copy of ``etree.SubElement`` to avoid an otherwise redundant import\n  of ``lxml.etree`` on the user side.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Fixed the \"descendant\" bug in cssselect a second time (after a first\n  fix in lxml 2.3.1).  The previous change resulted in a serious\n  performance regression for the XPath based evaluation of the\n  translated expression.  Note that this breaks the usage of some of\n  the generated XPath expressions as XSLT location paths that\n  previously worked in 2.3.1.\n\n* Fixed parsing of some selectors in cssselect. Whitespace after combinators\n  \">\", \"+\" and \"~\" is now correctly ignored. Previously is was parsed as\n  a descendant combinator. For example, \"div> .foo\" was parsed the same as\n  \"div>* .foo\" instead of \"div>.foo\".\n\nOther changes\n--------------",
