    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix\n\n1.3.3 (2007-07-26)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* ElementTree compatible parser ``ETCompatXMLParser`` strips processing\n  instructions and comments while parsing XML\n\n* Parsers now support stripping PIs (keyword argument 'remove_pis')\n\n* ``etree.fromstring()`` now supports parsing both HTML and XML, depending on\n  the parser you pass.\n\n* Support ``base_url`` keyword argument in ``HTML()`` and ``XML()``\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Parsing from Python Unicode strings failed on some platforms\n\n* ``Element()`` did not raise an exception on tag names containing ':'\n\n* ``Element.getiterator(tag)`` did not accept ``Comment`` and\n  ``ProcessingInstruction`` as tags. It also accepts ``Element`` now.",
