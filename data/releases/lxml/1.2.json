    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.2 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.2bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.2#egg=lxml-1.2bugfix\n\n1.2 (2007-02-20)\n================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Rich comparison of QName objects\n\n* Support for regular expressions in benchmark selection\n\n* get/set emulation (not .attrib!) for attributes on processing instructions\n\n* ElementInclude Python module for ElementTree compatible XInclude processing\n  that honours custom resolvers registered with the source document\n\n* ElementTree.parser property holds the parser used to parse the document\n\n* setup.py has been refactored for greater readability and flexibility\n\n* --rpath flag to setup.py to induce automatic linking-in of dynamic library\n  runtime search paths has been renamed to --auto-rpath. This makes it\n  possible to pass an --rpath directly to distutils; previously this was being\n  shadowed.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Element instantiation now uses locks to prevent race conditions with threads\n\n* ElementTree.write() did not raise an exception when the file was not writable\n\n* Error handling could crash under Python <= 2.4.1 - fixed by disabling thread\n  support in these environments\n\n* Element.find*() did not accept QName objects as path\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* code cleanup: redundant _NodeBase super class merged into _Element class\n  Note: although the impact should be zero in most cases, this change breaks\n  the compatibiliy of the public C-API",
