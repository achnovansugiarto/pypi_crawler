    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, current bug fixes become\navailable at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.0bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.0#egg=lxml-2.0bugfix\n\n2.0.6 (2008-05-31)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Incorrect evaluation of ``el.find(\"tag[child]\")``.\n\n* Windows build was broken.\n\n* Moving a subtree from a document created in one thread into a\n  document of another thread could crash when the rest of the source\n  document is deleted while the subtree is still in use.\n\n* Rare crash when serialising to a file object with certain encodings.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* lxml should now build without problems on MacOS-X.",
