    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix\n\n1.3.4 (2007-08-30)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* The ``ElementMaker`` in ``lxml.builder`` now accepts the keyword arguments\n  ``namespace`` and ``nsmap`` to set a namespace and nsmap for the Elements it\n  creates.\n\n* The ``docinfo`` on ElementTree objects has new properties ``internalDTD``\n  and ``externalDTD`` that return a DTD object for the internal or external\n  subset of the document respectively.\n\n* Serialising an ElementTree now includes any internal DTD subsets that are\n  part of the document, as well as comments and PIs that are siblings of the\n  root node.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Parsing with the ``no_network`` option could fail\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* lxml now raises a TagNameWarning about tag names containing ':' instead of\n  an Error as 1.3.3 did.  The reason is that a number of projects currently\n  misuse the previous lack of tag name validation to generate namespace\n  prefixes without declaring namespaces.  Apart from the danger of generating\n  broken XML this way, it also breaks most of the namespace-aware tools in\n  XML, including XPath, XSLT and validation.  lxml 1.3.x will continue to\n  support this bug with a Warning, while lxml 2.0 will be strict about\n  well-formed tag names (not only regarding ':').\n\n* Serialising an Element no longer includes its comment and PI siblings (only\n  ElementTree serialisation includes them).",
