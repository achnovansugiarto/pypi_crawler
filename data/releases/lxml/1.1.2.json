    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It provides\nsafe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree API.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.1 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.1bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.1#egg=lxml-1.1bugfix\n\n1.1.2 (2006-10-30)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* Data elements in objectify support repr(), which is now used by dump()\n\n* Source distribution now ships with a patched Pyrex\n\n* New C-API function makeElement() to create new elements with text,\n  tail, attributes and namespaces\n\n* Reuse original parser flags for XInclude\n\n* Simplified support for handling XSLT processing instructions\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Parser resources were not freed before the next parser run\n\n* Open files and XML strings returned by Python resolvers were not\n  closed/freed\n\n* Crash in the IDDict returned by XMLDTDID\n\n* Copying Comments and ProcessingInstructions failed\n\n* Memory leak for external URLs in _XSLTProcessingInstruction.parseXSL()\n\n* Memory leak when garbage collecting tailed root elements\n\n* HTML script/style content was not propagated to .text\n\n* Show text xincluded between text nodes correctly in .text and .tail\n\n* 'integer * objectify.StringElement' operation was not supported",

      "details": "NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

      "details": "NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function).
