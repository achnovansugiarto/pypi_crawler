    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\r\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\r\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\r\n\r\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\r\n<http://codespeak.net>`_ or see our bug tracker at\r\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\r\n\r\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\r\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\r\navailable at\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2 .\r\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==2.2bugfix`` will install\r\nthe unreleased branch state from\r\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.2#egg=lxml-2.2bugfix\r\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.\r\n\r\n2.2.3 (2009-10-30)\r\n==================\r\n\r\nFeatures added\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nBugs fixed\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* The ``resolve_entities`` option did not work in the incremental feed\r\n  parser.\r\n\r\n* Looking up and deleting attributes without a namespace could hit a\r\n  namespaced attribute of the same name instead.\r\n\r\n* Late errors during calls to ``SubElement()`` (e.g. attribute related\r\n  ones) could leave a partially initialised element in the tree.\r\n\r\n* Modifying trees that contain parsed entity references could result\r\n  in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\n* ObjectifiedElement.__setattr__ created an empty-string child element when the\r\n  attribute value was rejected as a non-unicode/non-ascii string\r\n\r\n* Syntax errors in ``lxml.cssselect`` could result in misleading error\r\n  messages.\r\n\r\n* Invalid syntax in CSS expressions could lead to an infinite loop in\r\n  the parser of ``lxml.cssselect``.\r\n\r\n* CSS special character escapes were not properly handled in\r\n  ``lxml.cssselect``.\r\n\r\n* CSS Unicode escapes were not properly decoded in ``lxml.cssselect``.\r\n\r\n* Select options in HTML forms that had no explicit ``value``\r\n  attribute were not handled correctly.  The HTML standard dictates\r\n  that their value is defined by their text content.  This is now\r\n  supported by lxml.html.\r\n\r\n* XPath raised a TypeError when finding CDATA sections.  This is now\r\n  fully supported.\r\n\r\n* Calling ``help(lxml.objectify)`` didn't work at the prompt.\r\n\r\n* The ``ElementMaker`` in lxml.objectify no longer defines the default\r\n  namespaces when annotation is disabled.\r\n\r\n* Feed parser failed to honour the 'recover' option on parse errors.\r\n\r\n* Diverting the error logging to Python's logging system was broken.\r\n\r\nOther changes\r\n-------------",
