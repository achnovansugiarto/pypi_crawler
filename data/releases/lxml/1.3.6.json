    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml, you can\nget it from the subversion repository at http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will install it from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev\n\nCurrent bug fixes for the stable version are at\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==1.3bugfix`` will install this\nversion from\nhttp://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-1.3#egg=lxml-1.3bugfix\n\n1.3.6 (2007-10-29)\n==================\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* Backported decref crash fix from 2.0\n\n* Well hidden free-while-in-use crash bug in ObjectPath\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* The test suites now run ``gc.collect()`` in the ``tearDown()``\n  methods.  While this makes them take a lot longer to run, it also\n  makes it easier to link a specific test to garbage collection\n  problems that would otherwise appear in later tests.",
