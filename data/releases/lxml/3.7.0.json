    "description": "lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It\nprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree\nAPI.\n\nIt extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,\nRelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.\n\nTo contact the project, go to the `project home page\n<http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at\nhttps://launchpad.net/lxml\n\nIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,\nyou can get it from the github repository at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to\nbuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project home\npage.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will\ninstall lxml from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have\nan appropriate version of Cython installed.\n\n\nAfter an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-3.7 .\nRunning ``easy_install lxml==3.7bugfix`` will install\nthe unreleased branch state from\nhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-3.7#egg=lxml-3.7bugfix\nas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this\nrequires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.\n\n3.7.0 (2016-12-10)\n==================\n\nFeatures added\n--------------\n\n* GH#217: ``XMLSyntaxError`` now behaves more like its ``SyntaxError``\n  baseclass.  Patch by Philipp A.\n\n* GH#216: ``HTMLParser()`` now supports the same ``collect_ids`` parameter\n  as ``XMLParser()``.  Patch by Burak Arslan.\n\n* GH#210: Allow specifying a serialisation method in ``xmlfile.write()``.\n  Patch by Burak Arslan.\n\n* GH#203: New option ``default_doctype`` in ``HTMLParser`` that allows\n  disabling the automatic doctype creation.  Patch by Shadab Zafar.\n\n* GH#201: Calling the method ``.set('attrname')`` without value argument\n  (or ``None``) on HTML elements creates an attribute without value that\n  serialises like ``<div attrname></div>``.  Patch by Daniel Holth.\n\n* GH#197: Ignore form input fields in ``form_values()`` when they are\n  marked as ``disabled`` in HTML.  Patch by Kristian Klemon.\n\nBugs fixed\n----------\n\n* GH#206: File name and line number were missing from XSLT error messages.\n  Patch by Marcus Brinkmann.\n\nOther changes\n-------------\n\n* Log entries no longer allow anything but plain string objects as message text\n  and file name.\n\n* ``zlib`` is included in the list of statically built libraries.",
