    "description": "The Mayavi *project* includes two related *packages* for 3-dimensional\nvisualization:\n\n- **Mayavi2**: A tool for easy and interactive visualization of data.\n- **TVTK**: A Traits-based wrapper for the Visualization Toolkit, a popular\n  open-source visualization library.\n\nThese libraries operate at different levels of abstraction. TVTK manipulates\nvisualization objects, while Mayavi2 lets you operate on your data, and then\nsee the results. Most users either use the Mayavi user interface or program\nto its scripting interface; you probably don't need to interact with TVTK\nunless you want to create a new Mayavi module.\n\nMayavi2\n-------\nMayavi2 seeks to provide easy and interactive visualization of 3-D data.\nIt offers:\n\n- An (optional) rich user interface with dialogs to interact with all data\n  and objects in the visualization.\n- A simple and clean scripting interface in Python, including one-liners,\n  or an object-oriented programming interface.\n- The power of the VTK toolkit, harnessed through these interfaces, without\n  forcing you to learn it.\n\nAdditionally Mayavi2 is a reusable tool that can be embedded in your\napplications in different ways or combined with the Envisage\napplication-building framework to assemble domain-specific tools.\n\n\n\nTVTK\n----\n\nTVTK wraps VTK objects to provide a convenient, Pythonic API, while supporting\nTraits attributes and NumPy/SciPy arrays. TVTK is implemented mostly in pure\nPython, except for a small extension module.\n\nDevelopers typically use TVTK to write Mayavi modules, and then use Mayavi to\ninteract with visualizations or create applications.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\nYou must have the following libraries installed before installing the Mayavi\nproject:\n\n* `Numpy <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy/1.1.1>`_ version 1.1.1 or later\n* `VTK <http://www.vtk.org/>`_ version 5.0 or later\n* `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/>`_ version 2.8 or later\n* `configobj <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj>`_",
