    "description": "# Digital Signal Processing Toolkit\n\nThis code started as a C++ program to perform trapezoidal filtering to a digitized signal from\n[XIA LLC's Pixie-16 hardware](https://www.xia.com/dgf_pixie-16.html). The original sample code came\nfrom a VB program using [IGOR](https://www.wavemetrics.com/) as its base. It fairly well\napproximates the filter calculations that happen on a Pixie-16 module. These algorithms are mostly\nfocused around XIA's hardware and function, but can be applied to **any** digitized signal.\n\n## Installation\n`pip install dsp_toolkit`\n\n## Module Descriptions\n\n### filtering\nImplements a simple trapezoidal filter without any bells and whistles. We also include a simple \nRC low-pass filter used for conditioning signals.  \n\nXIA LLC uses [trapezoidal filtering](https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774600) to calculate\ntrigger positions and energies. The functions in this script approximate the Pixie-16 on-board\ncalculations. We have functions to calculate\n\n* trigger positions,\n* signal baseline,\n* signal energy,\n* energy sums,\n* and trigger and energy responses.\n\nWe've made no attempt to convert bins to time. Users can do this trivially if they know the sampling\nfrequency of their signal.\n\n### sample_data\nThe sample data include both energy spectra, and digitized signals. The signals can be used with the\nvarious filtering and fitting functions. The energy spectra can be used with pileup calculations. \n\n### signal_pileup\nTakes a user provided energy distribution (either binned or raw) and calculates signal pileups\nbased on trapezoidal filter parameters and count rates. We've also provided some macros that can be \nused with the CERN ROOT program. Those scripts served as the basis for the python functions. \n\n### timing\nProvides both fitting and constant fraction discrimination (CFD) functions. We implement both a \ntraditional CFD, and a CFD described in XIA's Pixie-16 Manual. We implement a couple of different \nfitting functions. The `vandle` function is the most tested and used function.",
