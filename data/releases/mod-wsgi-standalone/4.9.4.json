    "description": "Overview\n--------\n\nThe mod_wsgi package provides an Apache module that implements a WSGI\ncompliant interface for hosting Python based web applications on top of the\nApache web server.\n\nThe primary package for mod_wsgi is available on the Python package index\n(PyPi) as ``mod_wsgi``. That package assumes that you have a suitable\nversion of Apache pre-installed on your target system, and if you don't,\ninstallation of the package will fail.\n\nIf you are on a UNIX like system (Linux) and need a version of Apache\nto be installed for you, you can use the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``\npackage on PyPi instead. When installing the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``\npackage it will first trigger the installation of the ``mod_wsgi-httpd``\npackage, which will result in a version of Apache being installed as\npart of your Python installation. Next the ``mod_wsgi`` package will be\ninstalled, with it using the version of Apache installed by the\n``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package rather than any system package for Apache.\n\nThis method of installation is only suitable for where you want to use\n``mod_wsgi-express``. It cannot be used to build mod_wsgi for use with\nyour system Apache installation. This installation method will not\nwork on Windows, and also currently fails on macOS because the Apache\nRuntime (APR) library, has not been updated to latest macOS versions.\n\nWhen installing mod_wsgi using this method, except that you will install\nthe ``mod_wsgi-standalone`` package instead of the ``mod_wsgi`` package,\nyou should follow installation and usage instructions outlined on the\nPyPi page for the ``mod_wsgi`` package.\n\n**NOTE: Although this package may allow you to install a standalone Apache\nversion, it is only really recommended that you use this package if you\nhave absolutely no other choice for getting the Apache httpd server\ninstalled. Always use the Apache httpd server supplied with the operating\nsystem if you can. Building this package if you do choose to do so, will\ntake some time. So if you you think the install is hanging, it is probably\nstill busy compiling everything.**\n\n\n",
