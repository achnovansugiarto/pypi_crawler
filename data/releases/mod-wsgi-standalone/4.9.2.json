    "description": "Overview\n--------\n\nThe mod_wsgi package provides an Apache module that implements a WSGI\ncompliant interface for hosting Python based web applications on top of the\nApache web server.\n\nThe primary package for mod_wsgi is available on the Python package index\n(PyPi) as ``mod_wsgi``. That package assumes that you have a suitable\nversion of Apache pre-installed on your target system, and if you don't,\ninstallation of the package will fail.\n\nIf you are on a UNIX like system (Linux, macOS) and need a version of\nApache to be installed for you, you can use the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``\npackage on PyPi instead. When installing the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``\npackage it will first trigger the installation of the ``mod_wsgi-httpd``\npackage, which will result in a version of Apache being installed as\npart of your Python installation. Next the ``mod_wsgi`` package will be\ninstalled, with it using the version of Apache installed by the\n``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package rather than any system package for Apache.\n\nNote that this method of installation is only suitable for where you want\nto use ``mod_wsgi-express``. It cannot be used to build mod_wsgi for use\nwith your system Apache installation. This installation method will also\nnot work on Windows.\n\nWhen installing mod_wsgi using this method, except that you will install\nthe ``mod_wsgi-standalone`` package instead of the ``mod_wsgi`` package,\nyou should follow installation and usage instructions outlined on the\nPyPi page for the ``mod_wsgi`` package.\n\n\n",
