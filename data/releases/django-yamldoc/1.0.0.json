    "description": "# `django-yamldoc`: Quoins for static sites\n\nThis is a Django application for maintaining documents in YAML format and\nrefining them to a traditional ORM’d database to serve them to users. It’s for\npeople who prefer VCS over SQL.\n\n## Status\n\n`yamldoc` is technically reusable, and used in multiple personal projects over\nthe years, with some individual YAML documents over a hundred thousand lines\nlong. However, `yamldoc` is probably of no interest to you. Its architecture\nis less elegant than the average Django app, mixing various concerns united\nonly by the theme of refining YAML to HTML via quearyable SQL.\n\n## History\n\n`yamldoc` was originally called `vedm` for “Viktor Eikman’s Django miscellania”.\n\n`yamlwrap`, available [here](https://github.com/veikman/yamlwrap), was once a\ncentral component of `yamldoc`.\n\nPer Django recommendation, `yamldoc` ships with its migrations. Because the\napplication is designed for static sites where the entire database is routinely\nrebuilt and therefore disposable, these migrations have been overwritten a few\ntimes. Under `semver`, things should be more stable nowadays, but do tell me if\nyou rely on that.\n\n## Legal\n\nCopyright 2016–2021 Viktor Eikman\n\n`django-yamldoc` is licensed as detailed in the accompanying file LICENSE.\n\n\n",
