    "description": "# `django-yamldoc`: Quoins for static sites\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-yamldoc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-yamldoc)\n\nThis is a Django application for maintaining documents in YAML format and\nrefining them to a traditional ORM’d database to serve them to users. It’s for\npeople who prefer VCS over SQL.\n\n## Status\n\n`yamldoc` is technically reusable, and used in multiple personal projects over\nthe years, with some individual YAML documents over a hundred thousand lines\nlong. However, `yamldoc` is probably of no interest to you. Its architecture\nis less elegant than the average Django app, mixing various concerns united\nonly by the theme of refining YAML to HTML via quearyable SQL.\n\n`yamldoc` is currently marked as compatible with `markdown < 3.3`. The two\npackages are in fact still compatible at >= 3.3, but `markdown` performance\nwith large blocks of HTML was degraded in 3.3. This is relevant to `yamldoc`\nand unsolved as of version 3.3.6, hence the soft block.\n\n## History\n\n`yamldoc` was originally called `vedm` for “Viktor Eikman’s Django miscellania”.\n\n`yamlwrap`, available [here](https://github.com/veikman/yamlwrap), was once a\ncentral component of `yamldoc`.\n\n## Legal\n\nCopyright 2016–2021 Viktor Eikman\n\n`django-yamldoc` is licensed as detailed in the accompanying file LICENSE.\n\n\n",
