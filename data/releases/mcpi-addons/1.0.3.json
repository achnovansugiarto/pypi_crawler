    "description": "# MCPI Addons\n\nA Minecraft Pi Edition: Reborn mod to add more features to the api.\n\n## Installing\n\nFirst you will need to install from pip, to do that you can use `pip3 install mcpi-addons`\nIf you don't want to compile it (or can't) then you can grab the newest version from the releases page.\n\n## Compiling\n\nJust run `make && make install` to create and install the bianary.\n\n## What does it do?\n\nIt adds these:\n\n- `custom.getUsername` (`mc.getUsername()`) to get the players username.\n- `custom.postWithoutPrefix` (`mc.postWithoutPrefix(msg)`) to post directly to chat (avoids usernames and sanitation).\n- `custom.postClient` (`mc.postToClient(msg)`) to post chat messages client side. It bypasses sanitization.\n- `custom.getSlot` (`mc.getSlot()`) to get the contents of the current slot.\n- `custom.give` (`mc.give(id, auxiliary = -2, count = -2)`) to change the current slot (-2 means it will stay the same, it isn't -1 becuase the id of -1 exists).\n- `custom.press` (`mc.press(key)`) to simulate pressing and holding a key (for example `mc.press(\"W\")` or `mc.press(\"SPACE\")`).\n- `custom.unpress` (`mc.unpress(key)`) to releases a key.\n- `custom.worldName` (`mc.worldName()`) to get the name of the world.\n- `custom.worldDir` (`mc.worldDir()`) to get the directory of the world.\n- `custom.particle` (`mc.particle(x, y, z, particle)`) to spawn a particle at a location. x, y, and z are floats and automaticly have 0.5 added to them so that they are centered.\n- `custom.debug` (`mc.debug(msg)`) prints a message to debug (only shown if `MCPI_DEBUG` = 1)\n- `custom.info` (`mc.info(msg)`) prints a info message.\n- `custom.warn` (`mc.warn(msg)`) prints a warning.\n- `custom.err` (`mc.err(msg)`) prints a error and stops MCPI.\n- `custom.getUsernames` (`mc.getUsernames()`) to get a list of the usernames that are playing\n- `world.getPlayerId` (`mc.getPlayerEntityId(name)`) this gets the entity id of a player from their name. This doesn't use the `custom` base because it is from the [RaspberryJuice](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/raspberryjuice.22724/) plugin which isn't compatible with MCPI or Reborn.\n- `custom.overrideTile` (`mc.overrideTile(before, after)`) overrides the tile with the id of `before` to the tile with the id of `after` unless `after` is an invaid id.\n- `custom.overrideItem` (`mc.overrideItem(before, after)`) overrides the item with the id of `before` to the item with the id of `after` unless `after` is an invaid id. (little testing, will have bugs).\n- `custom.resetOverrides` (`mc.resetOverrides()`) resets item and tile overrides.\n- `world.getBlocks` (`mc.getBlocks(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)`) to get a 1D list of blocks.\n- `custom.getBlocks3D` (`mc.getBlocks3D(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)`) to get a 3D list of blocks.\n\nI want to add more so please give me suggestions.\n\n## Known bugs\n\n- Using the particle `iconcrack` with `mc.particle` crashes the game, but using an invaild particle name is fine.\n- `postToClient` really doesn't like it when you use `\\x0a` along with some other chars. When posted they might also post a lot of garbage to server side chat. Once it wouldn't stop spamming chat until I used `htop` to kill reborn.\n\n## Extras\n\n### Raspberry Juice compatibility\nOne day all of these will be supported.\n\n[x] `getBlocks`\n[x] `getPlayerEntityId`\n[ ] `player/entity.getRotation`\n[ ] `player/entity.getPitch`\n[ ] `player/entity.getDirection`\n[ ] `events.pollChatPosts`\n[ ] ChatEvent\n\n\n### Particles\n\nParticles are client side and only shown if the player is within 16 blocks.\nHere is a particle list I found at `0x107511` in `minecraft-pi`\n- `bubble` (only works in water)\n- `crit`\n- `flame`\n- `lava`\n- `smoke`\n- `largesmoke`\n- `reddust`\n- `ironcrack` (crashes the game)\n- `snowballpoof`\n- `explode`\n\n### Tiles/Items\n\nA list of tiles can be found [here](https://wiki.mcpirevival.tk/wiki/Minecraft:_Pi_Edition_Complete_Block_List) and a list of items [here](https://wiki.mcpirevival.tk/wiki/Minecraft:_Pi_Edition_Complete_Item_List).\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **1.0.3**\n  - Added `world.getBlocks`, `custom.getBlocks3D`.\n  - Improved `custom.particle`.\n  - Removed `getOffset` from `minecraft.py`.\n\n- **1.0.2**\n  - Added `custom.overrideTile`, `custom.overrideItem`, and `custom.resetOverrides`.\n\n- **1.0.1**\n  - Added functionality to `world.getPlayerId`.\n  - Added `custom.getUsernames`.\n\n- **1.0.0**\n  - Stopped `getSlot` from crashing the game with invaild ids.\n  - Added `press`, `unpress`, `worldName`, `worldDir`, `particle`, `getOffset`, and logging (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `err`).\n  - Uploaded to pypi and github.\n\n- **Beta**\n  - Added `getSlot` and `give`.\n\n- **Alpha**\n  - Had `getUsername`, `postWithoutPrefix`, and `postClient`.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nHere is a screenshot of using overrides and particles:\n![ ](https://i.imgur.com/I8d8I0G_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand)",
