    "description": "# Marker-Web\n\nThis is a Flask-backend and Vue.js frontend for the [*marker* library](https://github.com/mustafaquraish/marker). The\n\n[Try it out with dummy data!](https://mustafaquraish.github.io/marker-web/#/) (Mobile friendly too)\n\n---\n\nRunning `marker-web` spins up a local server and hosts the frontend so you can use the marking utilities with a GUI. The layout makes it trivial to package this as a standalone app if needed.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is still in development. There most definitely are UI quirks and missing features. If you find any, please open an Issue on GitHub and let me know!*\n\n---\n\n## How to install\n\nThere are 2 ways to install this marker. \n\n### Using PIP\nThis is by far the recommended way of installing this utility. Simply run:\n```bash\npip install marker-web\n```\n\n### Build from source\n\nAlternatively, if you want to develop, you will need to build from source:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mustafaquraish/marker-web\ncd marker-web\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n---\n\n## How to use\n\n### Locally\n\nIn it's simplest form, you can start up the server with:\n```bash\n$ marker-web\n```\nYou can also pass in the [same arguments as `marker` CLI](https://marker-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/system_overview.html#using-the-cli). \n\nCurrently, if either:\n\n1. Your configuration file is not is not `assgn_dir/config.yml`, or \n2. Your `src_dir` is not the same as `assgn_dir`\n\nThen you **must** pass in the correct arguments when running `marker-web`. Otherwise, the interface provides a little file explorer which lets you pick `assgn_dir` (and can infer the other two arguments)\n\nBy default, anyone else logged in on the machine can access the endpoints. To prevent this, you can run in *authenticated mode* with:\n\n```bash\n$ marker-web --auth\n```\nThis will print out a random token which needs to be entered in the frontend to be able to access any information. A link is also print out with the token embedded in it, so you can just open that URL in your browser.\n\nBy default, the server runs on port `6275`. You can specify an alternate port using:\n\n```bash\n$ marker-web --port PORT\n```\n\n### Remote (Experimental)\n***Note: This requires the remote machine to have `marker-web` installed, and for you to have SSH access to it***.\n\nIf you want to run the marker on a remote machine, but show the frontend on your local browser, this can be done via port-forwarding over SSH. For full flexibility, you want to [do this manually](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling/example). However, if you are fine with some defaults, you can run:\n\n```bash\n$ marker-web --remote HOST\n```\nwhich is approximately the same as running:\n```bash\n$ ssh -L PORT:localhost:PORT HOST marker-web --auth\n```\n\n---\n\nFor the features available to you in the GUI, you should read through the [documentation for the marker CLI](https://marker-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Most things should be self-explanatory. \n\n---\n\n## Development notes:\n\n- The `frontend` directory contains the Vue frontend\n- The `marker_web` directory contains the marker_server\n- The `extra` directory contains some files to build a standalone app (on MacOS at least)\n\n\n",
