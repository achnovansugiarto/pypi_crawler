    "description": "django-vellum\n=============\n\nA [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) web log application.\n\n\nGenesis\n-------\n\nThis application began life as part of [Nathan Borror](http://nathanborror.com/)'s [django-basic-apps](https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps), a collection of simple prebuilt Django applications.\n\nWhen I first decided I wanted to move to a Django-based blog, I looked around to see if there were any existing projects I could use. There was certainly no shortage of blog applications, but none of them were exactly what I was looking for. Nathan's basic blog was close, but, as the name implies, very basic. [Kevin Fricovsky](http://montylounge.com/)'s [django-mingus](https://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus), which is itself built on top of Nathan's basic blog, appealed to me the most, but still had aspects that I did not like. So I decided to create my own.\n\nIn true open source fashion, I forked django-basic-apps. It provided an excellent framework to work from -- had I started from scratch, I would have ended up recreating a lot of what Nathan had already done. With that fork, along with some ideas inspired by django-mingus and Wordpress, I was able to craft a blog application that suited me perfectly. I think it's pretty nice -- and it turns out it suits some other people pretty well, too!\n\nThe only thing I did not like about it was that the blog was part of a larger collection of Django applications, most of which I did not use. I am happy to put my name on the blog, but I did not want to maintain or vouch for the numerous other apps. So, I spun off the two other applications that I did use ([django-media](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-media) and [django-inlineobjects](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-inlineobjects)), deleted the rest, and renamed the blog.\n\nThus, django-[vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum).\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n\n### Wordpress Import\n\nA management script is included to import blog posts from a Wordpress-generated XML file. For more information, run `./manage.py wordpress_import`.\n\n\n### Disqus\n\n[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments are supported (and recommended).\n\n\n### Excerpts\n\nAn author can manually specify content to use as the tease of a post. If they choose not to do this, they may instead choose to display an excerpt which is automatically generated by truncating the post body.\n\n\n### Markup\n\nPosts can be written in traditional HTML, plaintext, or any number of markup languages ([Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is recommended).\n\nIf Markdown is used, an enjoyable writing experience is provided by [django-wmd](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd/).\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* [django-inlineobjects](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-inlineobjects) is required for including content objects inside of blog posts.\n* [django-simplesearch](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-simplesearch) is required for searching posts.\n* [django-taggit](https://github.com/alex/django-taggit) is required for tagging.\n* [django-taggit-templatetags](https://github.com/feuervogel/django-taggit-templatetags) is required for generating a tag cloud.\n* [django-markup](https://github.com/bartTC/django-markup/>) is required for markup language support.\n* The [Python Markdown library](http://packages.python.org/Markdown/) is required for Markdown support. (Markdown support can be disabled, but it is the default choice. If the user does not specify otherwise, all posts are put through Markdown.)\n* The [Django comment framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/) must be installed, unless Disqus support is enabled (see below).\n\n\n### Suggested\n\nThe following packages are not required, but are suggested to take full advantage of django-vellum.\n\n* [django-disqus](http://github.com/arthurk/django-disqus) is suggested for [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)-powered comments.\n* [smartypants](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/smartypants) is suggested for smart typography (curly quotes, en- and em-dashes, ellipses, etc.).\n* [django-wmd](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd/) is suggested for an enhanced [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) experience.\n* [django-media](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-media) may be used in conjuction with (the previously mentioned) django-inlineobjects to include photos in posts.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\ndjango-vellum is available on PyPI and can be installed with PIP.\n\n    pip install django-vellum\n\nAlternatively, you may download the source and install it.\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n1. Add `vellum` to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.\n2. Add `vellum.context_processors.blog_settings` to your `settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`.\n\n\nQuestions\n---------\n\nIf you have any questions, or encounter any issues, email me at [pm@pig-monkey.com](mailto:pm@pig-monkey.com).\n\nFull documentation is coming, I promise!",
