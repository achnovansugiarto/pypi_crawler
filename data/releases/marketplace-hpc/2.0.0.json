    "description": "# MarketPlace HPC Gateway app\n\n## Interact with HPC through MarketPlace proxy using SDK\n\nThis repository provide SDK for using or integrating the HPC gateway app into other MarketPlace app.\n\nFirst, create a `hpc` instance with:\n\npython\n```\nfrom marketplace_hpc import HpcGatewayApp\n\nhpc = HpcGatewayApp(\n    client_id=<app_id>, # This is the HPC gateway app.\n    access_token=<your_access_token>,\n)\n```\n\nThe following capabilities are supported and can be called by using the SDK.\n\n- Check the availability of system: `hpc.heartbeat()`\n- Create a new calculation: `hpc.new_job()`, the resourceid will returned to list files on remote workdir, upload/downlead/delete files and the launch/delete job.\n- Upload file: `hpc.upload_file(resourceid=<resourceid>, source_path=<file_local_path>`.\n- Download file: `hpc.download_file(resourceid=<resourceid>, filename=<filename>`.\n- Delete file: `hpc.delete_file(resourceid=resourceid, filename=<filename>)`\n- List jobs (only CSCS deployment): `hpc.list_jobs()`.\n- Launch job: `hpc.run_job(resourceid=<resourceid>)`\n- Delete job: `hpc.delete_job(resourceid=resourceid)`\n\nYou can find example at https://github.com/materials-marketplace/hpc-sdk/blob/main/hpc_api.ipynb\n\n### Materials Cloud (CSCS) deployment\n\nThe correspond HPC-Gateway app is https://www.materials-marketplace.eu/app/hpc-app (ID: `5fd66c68-50e9-474a-b55d-148777ae3efd`) deployed on production server.\n\nSince it deployed using Materials Cloud CSCS resources provided by EPFL, it is only for test purpose and MarketPlace users who what to use it need to contact Jusong Yu @unkpcz (jusong.yu@epfl.ch) to add your MarketPlace account to the whitelist and then register your account by:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n   -H \"Authorization:Bearer <put_your_token_here>\" \\\n   'https://mp-hpc.herokuapp.com/user'\n```\n\n### IWM deployment\n\nThe correspond HPC-Gateway app is [HPC gateway (broker)](https://staging.materials-marketplace.eu/app/hpc-gateway-broker) (ID: `dc67d85e-7945-49fa-bf85-3159a8358f85`) deployed on staging server since RPC broker server needed.\n\n\n## Development and run locally for testing\n\n- Create a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies.\n- `pip install -U \".[dev]\"`\n- Run `python app.py` to start the development server.\n- Navigate to http://localhost:5005/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\n## Registry the app to MarketPlace\n\nhttps://materials-marketplace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apps/registration.html\n\n## How to deploy app to heroku (for Materials Cloud deployment)\n\nSet all the ENV variables in heroku dashbooard (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars). Check `cscs.env.template` for all variables needed.\n\nInstall the Heroku CLI\nDownload and install the Heroku CLI.\n\nIf you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.\n\n```\n$ heroku login --interactive\n```\n\nClone the repository\nUse Git to clone mp-hpc's source code to your local machine.\n\n```\n$ heroku git:clone -a mp-hpc\n$ cd mp-hpc\n```\n\nor in the repo add heroku remote repo to push\n\n```\n$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/mp-hpc.git\n```\n\nDeploy your changes\nMake some changes to the code you just cloned and deploy them to Heroku using Git.\n\n```\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -am \"make it better\"\n$ git push heroku master\n```\n\n## How to deploy the infracstructures and run hpc-app on IWM HPC.\n\n### Firecrest deployment\nThe firecrest on MarketPlace firecrest server need to be started.\nGo to `firecrest/` folder of `hpc-fire` server and run `docker-compose up -d`.\nThe changes of firecrest deployment that needed on MarketPlace HPC can be found on https://github.com/unkcpz/firecrest/pull/1\n\n### HPC-GW app and rpc-broker server\n[.deploy/docker-compose.yml]\nThen need to start the hpc-gateway-app to communicate to the firecrest.\nSince the hpc-app is in the private internal network, we use MarketPlace broker to talk to public network.\nGo to the hpc-app repo and run `python app.py` (WIP: using docker-compose to start so the dependencies are not needed).\nThis will start the hpc-app and the `rpc-brocker` (should be optinonal for the hpc-app accessable deployed on public network).\n\n## For maintainers\n\nThe release is for SDK but not the deployment.\nFor the deployment, always clone the repository and using the docker-compose to deploy to the system.\n\nTo create a new SDK release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update`.\nThis will:\n\n  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.\n  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.\n  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.\n    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Jusong Yu (EPFL)\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
