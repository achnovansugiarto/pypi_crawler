    "description": "LRU Dict\n========\n\nA fixed size dict like container which evicts Least Recently Used (LRU) items\nonce size limit is exceeded. There are many python implementations available\nwhich does similar things. This is a fast and efficient C implementation.\nLRU maximum capacity can be modified at run-time.\nIf you are looking for pure python version, look `else where <http://www.google.com/search?q=python+lru+dict>`_.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis can be used to build a LRU cache. Usage is almost like a dict.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  from lru import LRU\n  l = LRU(5)         # Create an LRU container that can hold 5 items\n  for i in range(5):\n     l[i] = str(i)\n  print l.items()    # Prints items in MRU order\n  # Would print [(4, '4'), (3, '3'), (2, '2'), (1, '1'), (0, '0')]\n\n  l[5] = '5'         # Inserting one more item should evict the old item\n  print l.items()\n  # Would print [(5, '5'), (4, '4'), (3, '3'), (2, '2'), (1, '1')]\n\n  l[3]               # Accessing an item would make it MRU\n  print l.items()\n  # Would print [(3, '3'), (5, '5'), (4, '4'), (2, '2'), (1, '1')]\n  # Now 3 is in front\n\n  l.keys()           # Can get keys alone in MRU order\n  # Would print [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]\n\n  del l[4]           # Delete an item\n  print l.items()\n  # Would print [(3, '3'), (5, '5'), (2, '2'), (1, '1')]\n\n  print l.get_size()\n  #Would print 5\n  l.set_size(3)\n  print l.items()\n  # Would print [(3, '3'), (5, '5'), (2, '2')]\n  print l.get_size()\n  # Would print 3\n\n  l.get_stats()\n  # Would print (1, 0)\n\n  l.clear()\n  print l.items()\n  #Would print []\n\nInstall\n=======\n\n::\n\n  pip install lru-dict\n\nor\n\n::\n\n  easy_install lru_dict\n\n\nWhen to use this\n================\n\nLike mentioned above there are many python implementations of an LRU. Use this\nif you need a faster and memory efficient alternative. It is implemented with a\ndict and associated linked list to keep track of LRU order. See code for a more\ndetailed explanation. To see an indicative comparison with a pure python module,\nconsider a `benchmark <https://gist.github.com/amitdev/5773979>`_ against\n`pylru <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylru/>`_ (just chosen at random, it should\nbe similar with other python implementations as well).\n\n::\n\n  $ python bench.py pylru.lrucache\n  Time : 3.31 s, Memory : 453672 Kb\n  $ python bench.py lru.LRU\n  Time : 0.23 s, Memory : 124328 Kb",
