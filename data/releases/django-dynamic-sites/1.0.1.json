    "description": "========\nOverview\n========\n\nA django application, which implements a flexible and generic viewsystem providing a convenient way to handle\nstaticpages, model based pages and much more.\n\nSO big question: What exactly does it for you?\n\nTLDR:\n=====\n\ndynamic_sites in its core is a combination of a site model representing each page\nand a set of generic views which in conjunction with django-sitetree create a powerful\nand yet simple system to create and manage static pages and model dependent/displaying pages.\n\nLong Answer:\n============\n\nThe core of the app is twofold.\nOn the one side you have the site model of which the instances represent each page\non your website. For each instance you can specify where in your sitetree it is placed\nwhich name it should have (for each language of your website), which template you\nyou want to be displayed, if so which picture should be displayed in the background,\nwhich rights are needed to access this page and a couple other things.\nMost importantly, if wished for, which model instances of the models you registered\nto the collecting signal (more on this in the usage part) you would like to be displayed\nor edited, printed and so one, on this page. All of this is handled via the admin\ninterface without any active coding on your site.\nNow to the second part. How does all this fancy stuff work so easy.\nThe core functionality comes from a small number of generic views. Detailed description\nof each view are found in the respective chapter. These views serve the not only\nthe site object you accessed via the url, but also serve the specified model and\nthe necessary templates to handle it. Depending on the title you gave the site on its creation\nit can also handle creation, editing, print-to-pdf, or deletion of objects from the given model.\n\nThe core point is here you have a ton of basic functionality for each of your custom\nmodels independent of which fields, capabilities or complexity it has. In addition\nyou can still add custom pages with your own views as long as you specify the url\npattern above the dynamic_sites.urls include (more in Installation and Usage).\n\nThe full Documentation can be found here_\n\n.. _here: https://django-dynamic-sites.readthedocs.io/\n\n* Free software: MIT license\n\n\n\nNeeded Dependencies\n===================\n\n| The package is based on the django-sitetree_ package which handles the tree structure, access permissions and menu generation.\n| For the translation capabilities django-modeltranslation_ is used.\n| django-bleach_ is used for cleaning textfields.\n\n.. _django-sitetree: https://pypi.org/project/django-sitetree/\n.. _django-modeltranslation: https://pypi.org/project/django-modeltranslation/\n.. _django-bleach: https://pypi.org/project/django-bleach/\n\nOptional Dependencies\n=====================\n\ndjango-weasyprint_ for printing to pdf via the ContentDownloadView.\n\n.. _django-weasyprint: https://pypi.org/project/django-weasyprint/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0.0 (2021-02-25)\n------------------\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n\n\n",
