    "description": "Medussa is an easy to use high-level cross-platform audio library for Python \n based on Port Audio and libsndfile. You can play NumPy arrays, stream sound\n files of various formats from disk, or create pure tones or 'on-line' white \n or pink noise. There are high-level functions like play_array (similar to \n matlab's wavplay). Or you can access specific host api's or devices, create \n streams as needed, and control them all asynchronously. Or for the most \n control, you can access the port audio library directly. Sweet!",
