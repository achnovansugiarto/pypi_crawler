    "description": "Medussa is an easy to use high-level cross-platform audio library for Python\nbased on Port Audio and libsndfile. You can play NumPy arrays, stream sound\nfiles of various formats from disk, or create pure tones or 'on-line' white\nor pink noise. There are high-level functions like play_array (similar to\nmatlab's old wavplay function but with more features). Or you can access \nspecific host api's or devices, create streams as needed, and control them \nall asynchronously. Or for the most control, you can access the port audio \nlibrary directly. Sweet!\n\n\n",
