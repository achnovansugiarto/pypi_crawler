    "description": "metaTED is a tool that makes it easy to download all of the `TED talks`_. It\ndoes so by creating over 8 `metalinks`_ of TED talks varying in both the\nquality levels and possible talk groupings by directory. Features include:\n\n    * Creates talks with informative file names - i.e.\n      ``Unconventional Explanations/Hans Rosling on HIV - New facts and stunning data visuals.mp4``\n      instead of original ``HansRosling_2009_480.mp4``.\n\n    * Tries hard to get all of the talks, or at least most of them - with a good\n      reason if some have failed.\n\n    * More choice - creates one metalink per available quality level\n      (currently low and high).\n\n    * More choice - creates one metalink per available talk grouping, with all\n      talks belonging to the same group placed inside a common directory. The\n      possible talk groupings are extracted from talks metadata (currently\n      filming/publishing year, talk theme and author).\n\n    * Aggressive caching throughout the project, to avoid expensive network/CPU\n      operations as much as possible. Proper cache invalidation included.\n\n    * High levels of fault tolerance. \n\n    * Simple, yet powerful homegrown web crawler. \n\n    * Flexible and extensible software design with changes in mind.\n\n    * Provides both the console script and a public API.\n\n.. _metalinks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalink\n.. _TED talks: http://www.ted.com/\n\nDownloading TED talks\n=====================\n\nIf you just want to `download TED talks`_, you don't need to install this\npackage, or even Python. All you need to do is get a\n`download client that supports the Metalink standard`_ and choose one of the\n`daily updated metalinks`_.\n\n.. _download TED talks: http://metated.petarmaric.com/\n.. _download client that supports the Metalink standard:\n        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalink#Client_programs\n.. _daily updated metalinks: http://metated.petarmaric.com/\n\nInstalling and running metaTED\n==============================\n\nmetaTED is available as an `easy-install`_-able package, you can install it with\n``easy_install -U metaTED``, or ``pip install metaTED`` if you have `pip`_.
