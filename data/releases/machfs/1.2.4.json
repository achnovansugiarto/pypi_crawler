    "description": "This is a library for creating and inspecting\n[HFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System)-format\ndisk images. Mac-specific concepts like [resource\nforks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork) and\n[type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_code)/[creator\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_code) are first-class\ncitizens.\n\nPython interface\n----------------\nThe Python API is simple. The contents of a `Volume` or a `Folder` are\naccessed using the index operator `[]`. While working on a filesystem,\nits entire high-level contents are stored in memory as a Python object.\n\n```\nfrom machfs import Volume, Folder, File\n\nv = Volume()\n\nv['Folder'] = Folder()\n\nv['Folder']['File'] = File()\nv['Folder']['File'].data = b'Hello from Python!\\r'\nv['Folder']['File'].rsrc = b'' # Use the macresources library to work with resource forks\nv['Folder']['File'].type = b'TEXT'\nv['Folder']['File'].creator = b'ttxt' # Teach Text/SimpleText\n\nwith open('FloppyImage.dsk', 'wb') as f:\n    flat = v.write(\n        size=1440*1024, # \"High Density\" floppy\n        align=512, # Allocation block alignment modulus (2048 for CDs)\n        desktopdb=True, # Create a dummy Desktop Database to prevent a rebuild on boot\n        bootable=True, # This requires a folder with a ZSYS and a FNDR file\n        startapp=('Folder','File'), # Path (as tuple) to an app to open at boot\n    )\n    f.write(flat)\n\nwith open('FloppyImage.dsk', 'rb') as f:\n    flat = f.read()\n    v = Volume()\n    v.read(flat) # And you can read an image back!\n```\n\nCommand-line interface\n----------------------\nThis package also installs the `MakeHFS` and `DumpHFS` utilities, for\nworking with folders on your native filesystem. Briefly, resource forks\nare stored in Rez-formatted `.rdump` files, and type and creator codes\nare stored in 8-byte `.idump` files. Admittedly this method of storage\nis not pretty, but it exposes changes to resource files without\nrequiring Mac-specific software. For example, Git can track the addition\nand removal of resources. Files with a `TEXT` type are assumed to be\nUTF-8 encoded with Unix-style (LF) line endings, and are converted to\nMac OS Roman encoding with Mac-style (CR) line endings.\n\nBoth commands have a `--help` argument to display their options.\n\nWhy?\n----\nI want an automated, reproducible way to compile legacy MacOS software.\nWithout any current operating system fully supporting HFS,\n[libhfs/hfsutils](https://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/) (a C library\nand command-line wrapper) is the most capable implementation. The\nimplementor chose to emulate POSIX I/O on a fake \"mounted\" filesystem.\nWhile this is important for machines with very limited RAM, the\nmaintenance of consistent HFS data structures across incremental\noperations is a complicated task requiring a large amount of low-level\ncode. Frequent I/O to the real filesystem also occurs. Current machines\nhave memory and cycles to burn, so an in-memory implementation in a\nhigh-level programming language seemed like a reasonable tradeoff. As a\nresult, `machfs` has nearly an order of magnitude fewer lines than\n`libhfs`, and is more maintainable, at a nearly negligible cost in\nperformance.\n\n\n",
