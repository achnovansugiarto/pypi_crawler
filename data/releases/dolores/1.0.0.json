    "description": "# Dolores ðŸ¤–âš¡\n\n\n## What is it?\n\n**Dolores** is a Python library designed to improve the developer experience when working with pretrained language models. **Dolores** provides prompts for interacting with language models that result in interesting or useful outputs. The purpose of this library is to simplify the learning curve by providing easy to use examples and sample text to get started. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most comprehensive repository of quality prompts for interacting with language models.**\n\nIt is named after [Dolores Abarnathy](https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/Dolores_Abernathy) of Westworld.\n\n## Installation (PyPi Package)\n```\n$ pip install dolores\n```\n\n## Main Features\n\n- Predefined prompts and hyperparameter settings to yield best results from common prompt inputs\n- A wrapper over the OpenAI API callable via functions\n- Easy to use CLI interface to make API calls into GPT-3\n\n## Usage\nEither do so in the python interpreter or in a python file.\n#### dolores.initialize(api_key: str, engine_name: str)\n\n```\nfrom dolores import Dolores\n\ndolores.initialize\"80085\", \"davinci\")\n```\n\nFrom there you may not call openai's API directly via the accessible methods in the Dolores class instance. The following out call the list engines API call. Each API call has an associated method call that can be used to call the API.\n\n\n### List Engines GET\nLists the currently available engines, and provides basic information about each option such as the owner and availability.\n```\ndolores.list_engines()\n```\n\n### Retrieve Engine GET\nRetrieves an engine instance, providing basic information about the engine such as the owner and availability.\n```\ndolores.retrieve_engine()\n```\n\n### Changing Engines\n##### dolores.set_engine(engine: str)\n\nAfter instantiating the Dolores class, subsequent class to the Open AI API will be made under the same engine selection. In order to change the engine used for the API call there is an exposed method.\n\n\n```\ndolores.set_engine(\"davinci\")\n```\n\nNote: Validation against the existing engine types is in consideration for future versions.\n\n### Complete Prompt POST (!important)\n##### dolores.complete_prompt(prompt: string, max_tokens: int = 5, temperature: int = 1, top_p: int = 1, n: int = 1)\n\nComplete a prompt. This is the main endpoint of the GPT-3 APIs. Returns new text as well as, if requested, the probabilities over each alternative token at each position.\n\nRequest:\n```\ndolores.create_completion(\"Is the JavaScript programming language better than python?\", 20)\n```\nResponse: (see response[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"] for plaintext response)\n```\nJSON: {'id': 'cmpl-kM6MK5dVRvD964MxeyG4AjCy', 'object': 'text_completion', 'created': 1595431739, 'model': 'ada:2020-05-03', 'choices': [{'text': ' in a far away place', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'length'}]}\n```\n\n`'in a far away place'` ðŸ˜‚\n\n#### Request Parameters\n\n| Name        \t| In   \t| Type              \t| Required \t| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \t|\n|-------------\t|------\t|-------------------\t|----------\t|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\n| engine      \t| body \t| string            \t| true     \t| The engine ID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \t|\n| prompt      \t| body \t| (see description) \t| false    \t| One or more prompts to generate from. Can be a string, list of strings, a list of integers (i.e. a single prompt encoded as tokens), or list of lists of integers (i.e. many prompts encoded as integers).                                                                                                 \t|\n| max_tokens  \t| body \t| integer           \t| false    \t| How many tokens to complete to.

Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend using this or top_p but not both.                                                        \t|\n| top_p       \t| body \t| number            \t| false    \t| An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend using this or temperature but not both. \t|\n| n        \t| body \t| integer                   \t| false    \t| How many choices to create for each prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \t|\n| stream   \t| body \t| boolean                   \t| false    \t| Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.                                                                                                                          \t|\n| logprobs \t| body \t| integer                   \t| false    \t| Include the log probabilites on the logprobs most likely tokens. So for example, if logprobs is 10, the API will return a list of the 10 most likely tokens. If logprobs is supplied, the API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. \t|\n| stop     \t| body \t| string or list of strings \t| false    \t| One or more sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                \t|\n\n\n### Complete Predefined Prompt\n### dolores.complete_predefined_prompt(prompt_key: string, index: int = 0, prompt: str = \"\")\n\nCompletes a prompt from a set of predefined prompts stored by dolores.\n\nRequest:\n```\ndolores.complete_predefined_prompt(\"philosopher\", 0, \"What is the meaning of life?\")\n```\nResponse:\n```\nJSON: {'id': 'cmpl-NvVlUd5tQWTIv7S0F6JMPkT5', 'object': 'text_completion', 'created': 1595631256, 'model': 'davinci:2020-05-03', 'choices': [{'text': ' The purpose of society?

These are archives that are uploaded to the Package Index and can be installed by pip.\n\nMake sure you have the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` installed:\n\n```\n$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel\n```\n\nNow run this command from the same directory where setup.py is located:\n\n```\n$ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nNote: Do not forget to update the version number in the setup.py file depending on the update.\n\n\n### Uploading Distribution Archives to PyPi ([Link](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives]))\n\nMake sure you have the latest `twine` package installed:\n```\n$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine\n```\n\nOnce installed, run Twine to upload all of the archives under dist:\n```\n$ python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*\n```\n\n\n",
