Install Library Using `pip`\n````shell script\n>> pip install django-upstorage-backend\n````\n\n## Starting Guide\n\n1. Set The Custom Storage Backend. Now Open settings.py of your project.\n````python\nDEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'django-upstorage-backend.storages.backends.U3Storage'\n````\n\n2. Set some required KEYS to `settings.py`\n````python\nAUTH_TOKEN = 'auth token from your account'\nAPI_KEY = 'api key of your project'\nUSERNAME = 'username of your account'\nPROJECT_NAME = 'Created Project name'\n````\n\nThats it, We are all done. Now all of your files will be handeled by the custom UpStorage's Backend Storage.\n\n\n## Advanced Guide\n\n* `You don't need to set 'upload_to' in model Fields (Defaultly it files will be saved on the root of your project.)`\n\n* `File Link Will Be Stored On Your Model As Expected.You Can call them as you do usally.`\n\n* `You Can also set 'upload_to='specific/folder' in your model like:`\n   ````python\n  Class TestModel(model.Model):\n      image = models.ImageField(upload_to='to/my/folder')\n\n  # this will save the file to that folder.if there's no folder it will create it.\n  ````\n\n* `If you want to delete the image from the UpStorage Bucket when you delete it from django, you have to do it a bit differently.Lemme show you`\n   ````python\n  Class TestModel(model.Model):\n      image = models.ImageField()\n\n  # To delete the image you have to delete that by writing:\n\n  obj = TestModel.objects.get(id=pk)\n  obj.image.delete()\n\n  # You can't directly delete it like this:\n\n  obj.delete() # this won't delete the file from UpStorage\n\n  # You have to delete the file field first to delete it.\n  ````\n  To make it simple you can override `delete` Method on your Model\n\n  ````python\n  Class TestModel(model.Model):\n      image = models.ImageField()\n\n      def delete(self):\n          self.image.delete()\n          super(TestModel, self).delete()\n  ````\n\n\n\n",
