It can be\nintegrated at various levels, depending on how much customization is required.\nIt integrates with ``django.contrib.auth``, although it is not a Django\nauthentication backend. The primary target is developers wishing to incorporate\nOTPs into their Django projects as a form of `two-factor authentication\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`_.\n\nSeveral simple OTP plugins are included and more are available separately. This\npackage also includes an implementation of OATH `HOTP\n<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226>`_ and `TOTP\n<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>`_ for convenience, as these are standard\nOTP algorithms used by multiple plugins.\n\nIf you're looking for a higher-level or more opinionated solution, you might be\ninterested in `django-two-factor-auth\n<https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth>`_.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nThis project is stable and maintained, but is no longer actively used by the\nauthor. Well-formed pull requests are welcome. Anyone interested in taking over\naspects of the project should `contact me <https://github.com/psagers>`_.\n\n.. end-of-doc-include\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nDevelopment dependencies are defined in the Pipfile; use `pipenv`_ to set up a\nsuitable shell.\n\nThe tests in tox.ini cover a representative sample of supported Python and\nDjango versions, as well as running `flake8`_ and `isort`_ for linting and style\nconsistency. Please run `tox` before checking in and sending a pull request.\n\n\n.. _pipenv: https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _flake8: https://pypi.org/project/flake8/\n.. _isort: https://pypi.org/project/isort/\n\n\n",
