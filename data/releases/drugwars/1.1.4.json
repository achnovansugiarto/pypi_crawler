The goal of the game is to pay off the loan shark and get as much money as possible while avoiding cops or getting mugged. Cops can shoot at you and you have 20 hit points until you die and the game ends. \n\nYou have 30 days to buy and sell as many drugs as possible to make a profit. Prices are randomly generated so it's all dependent on the market in the area you're at.\n\nThere are events that can happen inbetween moving areas. These can either be good for you or bad, it's all random.\n\nYou have access to a bank and stash in the Bronx which allows you to store money and drugs to keep them safe while getting mugged or caught by the cops.\n\n**When asked yes or no questions:** Respond with `y` or `n`\n\n**When asked to (B)uy, (S)ell, or (J)et:** Respond with `b` to buy, `s` to sell, or `j` to jet\n\n**When asked to (R)un or (F)ight:** Respond with `r` to run, or `f` to fight\n\n**When asked where to go:** Respond with a number `1-6`, these correspond to a location on the table\n\n# Why did I make this?\n\nDrugwars is a game I've been playing for a long time, well before I learned how to program. Now that I'm apt in Python I thought what the hell, why not rewrite a game I love in Python and release it. Well that's what I'm doing and here it is. Enjoy :)\n\n# Changelog\n\nv1.1.4:\n\n```\n- Remove Auto update\n```\n\nv1.1.3:\n\n```\n- Fix logic around pricing events\n```\n\nv1.1.2:\n\n```\n- Disable Actions from occuring first round\n```\n\nv1.1.1:\n\n```\n- Adds auto update check (Set DO_NOT_UPDATE to 1 to skip)\n```\n\nv1.1.0:\n\n```\n- Adds upgrade trench coat\n- Changes chances of getting away from Headass\n- Fixes crashing bugs\n```\n\n",
