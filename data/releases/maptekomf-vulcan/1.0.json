    "description": "# maptekomf.vulcan\nProvides support for inter-operability with the OMF format and Maptek Vulcan.\n\nThe sister package maptekomf.maptek provides support for inter-operability with\nthe Open Mining Format (OMF) and Maptek applications built on a shared\nunderlying infrastructure (which Maptek Vulcan is not built on).\n\n## Supported application versions\n* Maptek Vulcan 2021.4 and later\n\nOlder versions such as Maptek Vulcan 2020 and 2021.x may work but they have\nnot been tested.\n\n## Implementation defined behaviour\nThis OMF importer/exporter implementation has the following behaviour that\nmay be different to how other implementations, scripts and applications handle\na given OMF project file. This is done in places where the OMF specification\ndoes not specify how such cases should be handled, especially in cases\nwhere data can't be represented natively in the data format.\n\n### Naming\nThe names of objects in an OMF project are not required to be unique.\nThe names of objects in a given folder in a Vulcan project need be\nunique as they are often stored on the file system.\n\nAs a result during import if a duplicate name is detected a numerical suffix\nwill be added.\n\n### Point colouring\nMaptek Vulcan's point and line sets have the concept of a per-point colour.\n\nIf the colours are not all the same when exporting, then they will be written\nas an attribute of type `omf.ColorData` on the object called \"point colours\".\n\nWhen importing, the \"point colours\" attribute will be recognised and read in\nas a colour array. Vulcan does not support an arbitrary number of colour\narray attributes, it only allows one set of colours for the points.\n\n### Cell visibility\nVulcan's grids have the concept of visibility (or a grid mask), as a way to\nhide cells that are not relevant. For example, they may fall outside the data\nrange (i.e. the area that was measured/recorded). This is achieved by saving it\nas an attribute for vertices called \"visibility\" in OMF and recognising the\nattribute in the importer.\n\n## Limitations\n\n* Per-facet attributes are not supported in Vulcan's data types.\n* Per-vertex attributes are not supported in Vulcan's data types.\n* Grids in Vulcan do not support texturing. This means textures for gridded\n  surfaces in an OMF file won't be imported.\n\n## Future work\n* Import and export for block models.\n  Support may be added on request; however the plan is to wait until this\n  package is updated to use omf-2.0.\n* Upgrade omf package from 1.0 to 2.0.\n* Support importing/exporting textured surfaces.\n* Support SCD (Colour map/legend) files and colour maps in general.\n\n## Distribution\nThis project is typically distributed as a Python wheel through PyPi.\nHowever, other mechanisms exist.\n\n\n",
