    "description": "# dosertools\n\ndosertools is a Python package for analyzing dripping-onto-substrate extensional rheology (DoSER) videos.\\\nThe software converts an input video into a series of binary images, produces a dataset of D/D0 and time values for \neach frame in the video, and generates values for the elongational relaxation time lambda_E, the diameter at critical \ntime (the onset of elasto-capillary behavior) D(t_c)/D0, and a guess for the quantity of \n(elongational viscosity / surface tension) eta_E/sigma.  \n\n## Authors\nRob Learsch and Red Lhota\\\nContact:\\\nrlearsch (at) caltech (dot) edu \n\n## Installation\n\ndosertools comes bundled with a pipfile which creates the python environment it needs to run. \nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pipenv. \nYou will need to install\npipenv if your installation of python doesn't have it. You can do this by typing \n```bash\npip install pipenv\n````\nin your terminal, followed by \n```bash\npipenv install\n```\n in the terminal from your dosertools directory. \n\nSee the file named \"example-and-settings.md\" and \"example_script.py\" for more information \non how to use this package.\n## Usage\ndosertools is expecting experiments that contain a pair of videos - one \"experimental\" video that contains \nthe fluid transitioning from needle to substrate, and one \"background\" video that contains only the\nneedle and the literal background of the camera's view. In our testing, we found a background video \nof 100 frames gives plenty of data to overcome any noise that would be found in a single frame. \n\ndosertools is written for DoSER videos of viscoelastic fluids. It can perform background \nsubtraction and image processing on videos of any type. However, the data processing \n(calculating elongational relaxation time, elongational viscosity, etc) is done using assumptions that\nare only true for fluids that exhibit elastocapillary behavior. \n\ndosertools calculates values with machine precision. It is up to the user to decide where to truncate the \ndata produced, based on the specifics of their own experimental setup. \n<!--\n```python\nimport foobar\n\n# returns 'words'\nfoobar.pluralize('word')\n\n# returns 'geese'\nfoobar.pluralize('goose')\n\n# returns 'phenomenon'\nfoobar.singularize('phenomena')\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\nPlease make sure to update tests as appropriate.\n\n-->\n## License\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Red C.
