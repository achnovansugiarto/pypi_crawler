What is Marrow Package?\n==========================\n\nThis package is a combination of utilities for handling object lookup, resolving object names, and managing simple to\ncomplex plugin architectures.  Notably it includes a dependency grapher system for extensions and a cross-runtime\nmethod for looking up qualified object names that works on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+.\n\nThis library is fully unit tested where possible.  (Two untested paths remain relating to use of on-disk directories\nfor plugin discovery.)\n\n\n2. Installation\n===============\n\nInstalling ``marrow.package`` is easy, just execute the following in a terminal::\n\n    pip install marrow.package\n\n**Note:** We *strongly* recommend always using a container, virtualization, or sandboxing environment of some kind when\ndeveloping using Python; installing things system-wide is yucky (for a variety of reasons) nine times out of ten.  We prefer light-weight `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html>`_, others prefer solutions as robust as `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_.\n\nIf you add ``marrow.package`` to the ``install_requires`` argument of the call to ``setup()`` in your applicaiton's\n``setup.py`` file, Marrow Package will be automatically installed and made available when your own application or\nlibrary is installed.  We recommend using \"less than\" version numbers to ensure there are no unintentional\nside-effects when updating.  Use ``marrow.package<1.2`` to get all bugfixes for the current release, and\n``marrow.package<2.0`` to get bugfixes and feature updates while ensuring that large breaking changes are not installed.\n\n\n2.1. Development Version\n------------------------\n\n    |developstatus| |developcover|\n\nDevelopment takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ in the\n`marrow.package <https://github.com/marrow/package/>`_ project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads\nare provided there.\n\nInstalling the current development version requires `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_, a distributed source code management\nsystem.  If you have Git you can run the following to download and *link* the development version into your Python\nruntime::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/marrow/package.git\n    (cd package; python setup.py develop)\n\nYou can then upgrade to the latest version at any time::\n\n    (cd package; git pull; python setup.py develop)\n\nIf you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes,\nand submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information see\n`GitHub's documentation <http://help.github.com/>`_.\n\n\n3. Getting Object References\n============================\n\nObject references describe the module and attribute path needed to resolve the object.  For example, ``foo:bar`` is a\nreference that describes importing \"foo\" prior to retrieving an object named \"bar\" from the module.  On Python 3.3+ a\nuseful shortcut is provided, ``__qualname__`` which speeds up this lookup.\n\nFor example, let's define a class and get a reference to it::\n\n    from marrow.package.canonical import name\n    \n    class Example(object):\n        pass\n    \n    assert name(Example) == '__main__:Example'\n\nYou can, depending on platform, retrieve a reference to any of the following types of objects:\n\n* Module level:\n\t* class\n\t* class instance\n\t* class method\n\t* class staticmethod\n\t* function\n\t* instance classmethod\n\t* instance method\n\t* instance staticmethod\n\t* shallow nested class\n* On Python 3.3+:\n\t* closure\n\t* deeply nested class or method\n\n\n4. Resolving Object References\n==============================\n\nTwo utilities are provided which allow you resolve string path references to objects.  The first is quite simple::\n\n    from marrow.package.loader import traverse\n    \n    assert traverse({'foo': {'bar': 27}}, 'foo.bar') == 27\n\nThis will search the dictionary described for a \"foo\" element, then \"bar\" element.\n\nThe ``traverse`` function takes some additional optional arguments.  If ``executable`` is ``True`` any executable\nfunction encountered will be executed without arguments. Traversal will continue on the result of that call.  You can\nchange the separator as desired, i.e. to a '/' using the ``separator`` argument.\n\nBy default attributes (but not array elements) prefixed with an underscore are taboo.  They will not resolve, raising\na LookupError.  You can allow these by setting ``protect`` to ``False``.\n\nCertain allowances are made: if a 'path segment' is numerical, it's treated as an array index. If attribute lookup\nfails, it will re-try on that object using array notation and continue from there.  This makes lookup very flexible.\n\n\n4.1. Resolving Import References\n--------------------------------\n\nThe more complete API for name resolution uses the ``load`` funciton, which takes the same optional keyword arguments\nas ``traverse``.  Additionally, this function accepts an optional ``namespace`` to search for plugins within.  For\nexample::\n\n    from marrow.package.loader import load\n    from pip import main\n    \n    # Load class Foo from example.objects\n    load('example.objects:Foo')\n        \n    # Load the result of the class method ``new`` of the Foo object\n    load('example.objects:Foo.new', executable=True)\n    \n    # Load the \"pip\" command-line interface.\n    assert load('pip', 'console_scripts') is main\n\nProviding a namespace does not prevent explicit object lookup (dot-colon notation) from working.\n\n\n4.2. Caching Import References\n------------------------------\n\nAn attribute-access dictionary is provided that acts as an import cache::\n\n    from marrow.package.cache import PackageCache\n    from pip import main\n    \n    cache = PackageCache('console_scripts')\n    \n    assert cache.pip is main\n    assert cache['pip'] is main\n    assert len(cache) == 1\n    assert 'pip' in cache\n\n\n4.3. Lazy Import Reference Attributes\n-------------------------------------\n\nYou can lazily load and cache an object reference upon dereferencing from an instance using the ``lazyload`` utility\nfrom the ``marrow.package.lazy`` module.  Assign the result of calling this function with either an object reference\npassed in positionally::\n\n    class MyClass:\n        debug = lazyload('logging:debug')\n\nOr the attribute path to traverse (using ``marrow.package.loader:traverse``) prefixed by a period::\n\n    class AnotherClass:\n        target = 'logging:info'\n        log = lazyload('.target')\n\nAny additional arguments are passed to the eventual call to `load()`.  This utility builds on a simpler one that is\nalso offered for fully-tested re-use, ``lazy``, a decorator like ``@property`` which will cache the result, with\nthread-safe locking to ensure only one call will ever be made to the decorated function, per instance.\n\n\n5. Managing Plugins\n===================\n\nThis package provides two main methods of dealing with plugins and extensions, the first is simple, the second\nprovides full dependency graphing of the extensions.\n\n5.1. Plugin Manager\n-------------------\n\nThe ``PluginManager`` class takes two arguments: the first is the entry point ``namespace`` to search, the second is\nan optional iterable of folders to add to the Python search path for installed packages, allowing your application to\nhave a dedicated plugins folder.\n\nIt provides a ``register`` method which take a name and the object to use as the plugin and registers it internally,\nsupporting both attribute and array-like notation for retrieval, as well as iteration of plugins (includes all entry\npoint plugins found and any custom registered ones).\n\n5.2. Extension Manager\n----------------------\n\nAt a higher level is a ``PluginManager`` subclass called ``ExtensionManager`` which additoinally exposes a ``sort``\nmethod capable of resolving dependency order for extensions which follow a simple protocol: have an attribute or array\nelement matching the following, all optional:\n\n* ``provides`` — declare tags describing the features offered by the plugin\n* ``needs`` — delcare the tags that must be present for this extension to function\n* ``uses`` — declare the tags that must be evaluated prior to this extension, but aren't hard requirements\n* ``first`` — declare that this extension is a dependency of all other non-first extensions\n* ``last`` — declare that this extension depends on all other non-last extensions\n* ``excludes`` — declare tags that must not be present in other plugins for this one to be usable\n\n\n6. Version History\n==================\n\nVersion 1.0\n-----------\n\n* **Initial release.**  Combination of utilities from other Marrow projects.\n\nVersion 1.0.1\n-------------\n\n* **Extended decorator support.**  New code paths and tests added to cover canonicalization of decorated functions.\n\nVersion 1.0.2\n-------------\n\n* **Diagnostic information.**  Removed extraneous diagnostic information.\n\nVersion 1.1\n-----------\n\n* **Added lazy evaluation.**  There are two new helpers for caching of ``@property``-style attributes and lazy lookup\n  of object references.\n\nVersion 1.2\n-----------\n\n* **Deprecated Python 2.6 and 3.3.** While no particular backwards incompatible change was made; as setuptools no\n  longer supports these versions, these versions are now hard/impossible to test.\n* **Allow extensions to declare exclusions.** Flags that must not be defined for the extension to be usable.\n\n\n7.
