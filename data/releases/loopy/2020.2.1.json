    "description": "Loopy: Transformation-Based Generation of High-Performance CPU/GPU Code\n=======================================================================\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/loopy/badges/master/pipeline.svg\n    :alt: Gitlab Build Status\n    :target: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/loopy/commits/master\n.. image:: https://github.com/inducer/loopy/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push\n    :alt: Github Build Status\n    :target: https://github.com/inducer/loopy/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3ACI+event%3Apush\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/loopy.png\n    :alt: Python Package Index Release Page\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/loopy/\n\nLoopy lets you easily generate the tedious, complicated code that is necessary\nto get good performance out of GPUs and multi-core CPUs.\nLoopy's core idea is that a computation should be described simply and then\n*transformed* into a version that gets high performance. This transformation\ntakes place under user control, from within Python.\n\nIt can capture the following types of optimizations:\n\n* Vector and multi-core parallelism in the OpenCL/CUDA model\n* Data layout transformations (structure of arrays to array of structures)\n* Loop unrolling\n* Loop tiling with efficient handling of boundary cases\n* Prefetching/copy optimizations\n* Instruction level parallelism\n* and many more\n\nLoopy targets array-type computations, such as the following:\n\n* dense linear algebra,\n* convolutions,\n* n-body interactions,\n* PDE solvers, such as finite element, finite difference, and\n  Fast-Multipole-type computations\n\nIt is not (and does not want to be) a general-purpose programming language.\n\nLoopy is licensed under the liberal `MIT license\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_ and free for commercial, academic,\nand private use. All of Loopy's dependencies can be automatically installed from\nthe package index after using::\n\n    pip install loopy\n\nIn addition, Loopy is compatible with and enhances\n`pyopencl <https://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl>`_.\n\n---\n\nPlaces on the web related to Loopy:\n\n* `Python package index <https://pypi.org/project/loopy>`_ (download releases)\n* `Documentation <https://documen.tician.de/loopy>`_ (read how things work)\n* `Github <https://github.com/inducer/loopy>`_ (get latest source code, file bugs)\n* `Homepage <https://mathema.tician.de/software/loopy>`_",
