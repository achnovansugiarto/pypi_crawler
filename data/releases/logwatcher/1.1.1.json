Metrics are named with the prefix \"LW_\" for easy identification. An instance of LogWatcher is required for each access log that is to be watched. The log file can be either statically named or pre-rotated with timestamp in the filename. Metrics are typically collected/averaged by minute, but this is configurable.\n\n\n#  Copyright 2015 CityGrid Media, LLC\n#\n#  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n#  you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n#  You may obtain a copy of the License at\n#\n#      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n#\n#  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n#  distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n#  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n#  See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n#  limitations under the License.\n#\nChangelog\n=========\n\nWishlist\n------------------\n\n* feature: TBD.\n\n1.0\n~~~~~~~\n* Initial release",
