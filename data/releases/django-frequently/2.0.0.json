    "description": "Home-page: https://github.com/bitmazk/django-frequently\nAuthor: Tobias Lorenz\nAuthor-email: tobias.lorenz@bitmazk.com\nLicense: The MIT License\nDescription: django-frequently\n        =================\n        \n        A Django application that can be used as a FAQ, a Q&A, for general\n        announcements or as a miniblog. There are a lot of functions to increase the\n        user experience, like sorting by popularity, statistics and ratings.\n        \n        Installation\n        ------------\n        \n        You need to install the following prerequisites in order to use this app::\n        \n            pip install Django\n        \n        If you want to use the cms app or the cms plugin please install additionally::\n        \n            pip install django-cms\n        \n        \n        If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::\n        \n            $ pip install django-frequently\n        \n        If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::\n        \n            $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-frequently.git#egg=frequently\n        \n        Add ``frequently`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::\n        \n            INSTALLED_APPS = (\n                ...,\n                # django-cms related\n                'cms',\n                'treebeard',\n                'menus',\n        \n                'ckeditor',\n                'frequently',\n            )\n        \n        Add the ``frequently`` URLs to your ``urls.py``::\n        \n            urlpatterns = [\n                url(r'^faq/', include('frequently.urls')),\n            ]\n        \n        As of version 2 of this app, there are some significant backwards incompatible\n        changes. If you are a new user, you are fine, existing users must check\n        the migration docs at\n        [cmsplugin-frequently](https://github.com/bitmazk/cmsplugin-frequently). When\n        you are ready to install this app, set the following setting to `True` in\n        your `settings.py`::\n        \n            FREQUENTLY_READY_FOR_V1 = True\n        \n        Now you can migrate your database::\n        \n            ./manage.py migrate frequently\n        \n        Usage\n        -----\n        \n        Just visit the root URL of the app. Let's assume you hooked the app into your\n        ``urls.py`` at `f/`, then visit `yoursite.com/f/`. You will see the entry\n        overview. As you can see, you can provide a form to let users submit their own\n        entries @ `yoursite.com/your-question/`.\n        \n        The entry handling is made by AJAX and jQuery, but is also functional without\n        Javascript enabled.\n        \n        * The entries can be up- or downvoted.\n        * The entries are sorted by popularity.\n        * Entries can be fixed via an extra attribute.\n        * The last view date and the amount of all views is tracked.\n        \n        Settings\n        --------\n        \n        FREQUENTLY_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS\n        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n        \n        Default: ``False``\n        \n        Set this to ``True`` if you want to allow anonymous users to see the list view\n        and to submit new questions.\n        \n        \n        FREQUENTLY_REQUIRE_EMAIL\n        ++++++++++++++++++++++++\n        \n        Default: ``True``\n        \n        Set this to ``False`` in order to hide the email field on the question create\n        form. This makes sense when you have set ``FREQUENTLY_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`` to\n        ``False`` - in this case you already know the email address of the user.\n        \n        \n        Template Tag\n        ------------\n        \n        We provide a template tag to render entries of a certain category.:\n        \n            {% render_category 'slug-of-the-category' %}\n        \n        IMPORTANT: Make sure to include the js file in this template:\n        \n            <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{% static \"frequently/js/frequently.js\" %}\"></script>\n        \n        \n        Contribute\n        ----------\n        \n        If you want to contribute to this project, please perform the following steps::\n        \n            # Fork this repository\n            # Clone your fork\n            $ mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 django-frequently\n            $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt\n            $ python setup.py test\n            # You should get no failing tests\n        \n            $ git co -b feature_branch master\n            # Implement your feature and tests\n            $ git add . && git commit\n            $ git push origin feature_branch\n            # Send us a pull request for your feature branch\n        \n        Whenever you run the tests a coverage output will be generated in\n        ``tests/coverage/index.html``. When adding new features, please make sure that\n        you keep the coverage at 100%.\n        \n        If you are making changes that need to be tested in a browser (i.e. to the\n        CSS or JS files), you might want to setup a Django project, follow the\n        installation instructions above, then run ``python setup.py develop``. This\n        will just place an egg-link to your cloned fork in your project's virtualenv.\n        \n        Roadmap\n        -------\n        \n        See the issue list on GitHub for features that are planned for the next\n        milestone.\n        \nKeywords: django,app,reusable,faq,questions,answers\nPlatform: OS Independent\n",
