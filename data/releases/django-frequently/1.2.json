    "description": "django-frequently\n=================\n\nA Django application that can be used as a FAQ, a Q&A, for general\nannouncements or as a miniblog. There are a lot of functions to increase the\nuser experience, like sorting by popularity, statistics and ratings.\n\nThis is an early alpha. Use it with caution.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou need to install the following prerequisites in order to use this app::\n\n    pip install Django\n    pip install South\n\nIf you want to use the cms app or the cms plugin please install additionally::\n\n    pip install django-cms\n\n\nIf you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::\n\n    $ pip install django-frequently\n\nIf you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::\n\n    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-frequently.git#egg=frequently\n\nAdd ``frequently`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...,\n        # django-cms related\n        'cms',\n        'mptt',\n        'menus',\n        'sekizai',\n\n        'frequently',\n    )\n\nAdd the ``frequently`` URLs to your ``urls.py``::\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        ...\n        url(r'^f/', include('frequently.urls')),\n    )\n\nAs of version 2 of this app, there are some significant backwards incompatible\nchanges. If you are a new user, you are fine, existing users must check\nthe migration docs at \n[cmsplugin-frequently](https://github.com/bitmazk/cmsplugin-frequently). When\nyou are ready to install this app, set the following setting to `True` in\nyour `settings.py`::\n\n    FREQUENTLY_READY_FOR_V1 = True\n\nNow you can migrate your database::\n\n    ./manage.py migrate frequently\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nJust visit the root URL of the app. Let's assume you hooked the app into your\n``urls.py`` at `f/`, then visit `yoursite.com/f/`. You will see the entry\noverview. As you can see, you can provide a form to let users submit their own\nentries @ `yoursite.com/your-question/`.\n\nThe entry handling is made by AJAX and jQuery, but is also functional without\nJavascript enabled.\n\n* The entries can be up- or downvoted.\n* The entries are sorted by popularity.\n* Entries can be fixed via an extra attribute.\n* The last view date and the amount of all views is tracked.\n\nSettings\n--------\n\nFREQUENTLY_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nDefault: ``False``\n\nSet this to ``True`` if you want to allow anonymous users to see the list view\nand to submit new questions.\n\n\nFREQUENTLY_REQUIRE_EMAIL\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nDefault: ``True``\n\nSet this to ``True`` in order to hide the email field on the question create\nform. This makes sense when you have set ``FREQUENTLY_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`` to\n``False`` - in this case you already know the email address of the user.\n\n\nTemplate Tag\n------------\n\nWe provide a template tag to render entries of a certain category.:\n\n    {% render_category 'slug-of-the-category' %}\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure to include the js file in this template:\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}frequently/js/frequently.js\"></script>\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project, please perform the following steps::\n\n    # Fork this repository\n    # Clone your fork\n    $ mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 django-frequently\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ ./frequently/tests/runtests.sh\n    # You should get no failing tests\n\n    $ git co -b feature_branch master\n    # Implement your feature and tests\n    $ git add . && git commit\n    $ git push origin feature_branch\n    # Send us a pull request for your feature branch\n\nWhenever you run the tests a coverage output will be generated in\n``tests/coverage/index.html``. When adding new features, please make sure that\nyou keep the coverage at 100%.\n\nIf you are making changes that need to be tested in a browser (i.e. to the\nCSS or JS files), you might want to setup a Django project, follow the\ninstallation instructions above, then run ``python setup.py develop``. This\nwill just place an egg-link to your cloned fork in your project's virtualenv.\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nSee the issue list on GitHub for features that are planned for the next\nmilestone.",
