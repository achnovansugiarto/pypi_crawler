    "description": "=====\nzzyzx\n=====\n\nDo you believe in the cloud? It's in fact only somebody else's computer.\nThose might fail or get hacked.\n\nDo you believe in bug-free software? Nah, it's more likely every now and\nthen a crash, a bug, a race condition or some other back luck will lead\nto data corruption of the things that you work on.\n\nDo you think you'll be able to access your notes in thirty years? It's\nlikely the data format they're stored in is going to be hard to read.\n\nThis is why I store all my notes in my e-mail. It's been there since the\n1970s, it's going to be there in the 2050s. MIME and IMAP ensure the\ndata is more-less plaintext and easily human-readable even without any\ntool support. Apple Notes support it on both OS X and iOS. Pure win.\n\nBut wait, what about software failure? What if a bug erases my notes or\nthere's a data center fire and the data restored from a backup is in\na state from two days ago? What about bitrot?\n\nEnter ``zzyzx``.\n\nThis is the most primitive backup system ever. Set it up in cron on your\nlaptop or a server you control and it will create incremental backups\nwith history between runs (setting up a Mercurial repository). It also\ncreates useful symlinks to human-readable note titles so you can find\nthem more easily.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIt requires Python 3.5+ and Click. Just install it from PyPI::\n\n   $ pip install zzyzx\n   $ cat >~/.zzyzx\n   [server]\n   host=mail.example.com\n   user=john@example.com\n   pass=secret\n\n   [backup]\n   repo_path=~/Notes\n   ignore_prefix=INBOX.Notes\n   $ zzyzx\n\n\nWhy the name ``zzyzx``?\n-----------------------\n\nIt's the last place on Earth. It's the end of the world.\n\n\nKnown issues\n------------\n\nDon't put the repo path in Dropbox as it doesn't support symlinks and\nyour other computers will see a lot of duplicate files.\n\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n2016.4.0\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* first published version\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\nGlued together by `Łukasz Langa <lukasz@langa.pl>`.",
