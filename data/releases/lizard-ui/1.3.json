    "description": "lizard-ui\n==========================================\n\nIntroduction\n\nUsage, etc.\n\nMore details in src/lizard_ui/USAGE.txt .\n\n\nDevelopment installation\n------------------------\n\nThe first time, you'll have to run the \"bootstrap\" script to set up setuptools\nand buildout::\n\n    $> python bootstrap.py\n\nAnd then run buildout to set everything up::\n\n    $> bin/buildout\n\n(On windows it is called ``bin\\buildout.exe``).\n\nYou'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in\n``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.\n\nThe current package is installed as a \"development package\", so\nchanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python\nsetup.py develop``).\n\nIf you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released\nversions), add them as an \"svn external\" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory\nand add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.\n\nTests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\\test.exe``.\n\n\nUsage of lizard-ui\n=============================================\n\n\nUsage:\n\n    >>> import lizard_ui\n\nShow how to import the main classes and how to use them.\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\n- Document how to use this UI.\n\n- Strip out some/most of the applications in the testsettings.py as they're\n  not really needed.\n\n- Add basic test that the example.html renders without errors.\n\n- Add mechanism for rendering a passed-in (or registered/configured) list of\n  object_tabs and object_actions, including some nice formatting.\n\n- Add jquery and extjs javascript libraries.\n\n- Beautify the UI.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- TODO started this library\n\n\nChangelog of lizard-ui\n======================\n\n\n1.3 (2010-06-23)\n----------------\n\n- Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.\n\n- UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in\n  corner cases, for instance).\n\n\n1.2 (2010-06-22)\n----------------\n\n- Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with\n  javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.\n\n- The main body has \"overflow: hidden\" to get rid of scrollbars once and for\n  all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A\n  scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have\n  an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is\n  perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual\n  content).\n\n\n1.1 (2010-06-18)\n----------------\n\n- IE tweaks.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-06-17)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed javascript code with jslint.\n\n- Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.\n  You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your\n  settings and add \"compressor\" to your installed apps.\n\n- Switched to a separate \"javascript\" and \"css\" block instead of the\n  site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when\n  you override the blocks.\n\n\n0.12 (2010-06-11)\n-----------------\n\n- Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).\n\n- Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'\n  implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our\n  existing sidebar css.\n\n\n0.11 (2010-06-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base\n  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.\n\n\n0.10 (2010-06-07)\n-----------------\n\n- Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().\n\n- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.\n\n\n0.9 (2010-06-03)\n----------------\n\n- Using jquery's live() for \"late binding\" of events to elements added later\n  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.\n\n\n0.8 (2010-06-01)\n----------------\n\n- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.\n\n\n0.7 (2010-05-18)\n----------------\n\n- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.\n\n- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed\n  div at the bottom.\n\n- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.\n\n\n0.6 (2010-04-28)\n----------------\n\n- Added collapsible sidebar.\n\n- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The\n  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up\n  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so\n  switching back to blueprint is now possible.\n\n- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.\n\n\n0.5 (2010-04-13)\n----------------\n\n- Layout improvements.\n\n- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).\n\n- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.\n\n- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't\n  included automatically anymore.\n\n- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.\n\n\n0.4 (2010-03-16)\n----------------\n\n- Added extjs javascript library.\n\n- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.\n\n\n0.3.1 (2010-03-05)\n------------------\n\n- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.\n\n\n0.3 (2010-03-05)\n----------------\n\n- Added openlayers 2.8.\n\n- Added famfamfam silk icon set.\n\n- Added background to menubar, footer and body.\n\n- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.\n\n\n0.2 (2010-02-12)\n----------------\n\n- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in\n  templates.  We're well-behaved now!\n\n\n0.1 (2010-02-12)\n----------------\n\n- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.\n\n- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript\n  resources.\n\n- Added blueprint css framework.\n\n- Initial structure created by nensskel.",
