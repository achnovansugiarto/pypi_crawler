    "description": "lizard-ui\n=========\n\nLizard-ui provides a basic `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ user\ninterface, so a **base Django template** and some **css + javascript**.  We\ndesigned it at `Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our\ngeographical information websites (with water management information).\n\n\nChoices, requirements, assumptions\n----------------------------------\n\nLizard-ui is opinionated: it makes choices and prescribes (good!)\ntechnologies.\n\n- Included: the `blueprint css framework <http://www.blueprintcss.org/>`_.  It\n  resets css styles so that we've got a common base.  It fixes common IE\n  layout bugs.  It gives a basic typography that's quite pleasing.\n\n- Required: `django-staticfiles\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles>`_.  For a more verbose\n  description, see `Reinout's blog entry\n  <http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/05/19/django-css-javascript-files.html>`_\n  (written with lizard-ui in mind).\n\n- Required: `django_compressor\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_compressor>`_ for combining css/javascript\n  files in production.\n\n- Assumption: one screen, using the full width/height of the browser, without\n  scrolling.  Our main goal is showing a nice big map with a small header and\n  a sidebar.  You don't want to scroll a map.  It is of course possible to\n  have a scrollbar inside that main content area itself.\n\n- Assumption: javascript is available.  Hey, we're showing a map so you need\n  javascript.  So we liberally use javascript to get the UI right, for\n  instance by detecting and setting the main content area's width and height.\n\n- Included: jquery.  Yeah, it is pretty much the standard nowadays.  So we use\n  jquery where jquery can be used instead of doing it with generic javascript.\n\n- Included: both jqueryui and jquerytools.  Visual goodies.  Jquerytools for\n  the overlay and tabs, jqueryui for the rest (drag/drop and so).\n\n- Included: openlayers as map javascript library.  (Lizard-map, sooooon to be\n  released, contains our basic map interaction javascript and python code).\n\n\nLicense + licenses\n------------------\n\nOur own license is GPLv3.\n\nLizard-ui ships with a couple of external css/javascript libraries.\n\nBlueprint\n  Modified MIT\n\nJquery and jqueryui\n  Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.  Includes Sizzle.js,\n  released under the MIT, BSD, and GPL Licenses.\n\nJquerytools\n  No copyrights or licenses. Do what you like.\n\nOpenlayers\n  Clear BSD license.\n\nFamfamfam icon set\n  CC attribution license.\n\nTreeview jquery plugin\n  MIT/GPL\n\n\nDjango settings\n---------------\n\nHere's an excerpt of a ``settings.py`` you can use.  The media and static root\ndirectory setup assumes the use of buildout, but you can translate it to your\nown filesystem setup::\n\n  INSTALLED_APPS = [\n      'lizard_ui',\n      'compressor',\n      'staticfiles',\n      'django.contrib.admin',\n      'django.contrib.auth',\n      'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n      'django.contrib.sessions',\n      'django.contrib.sites',\n      ]\n\n  # Note: the below settings are more elaborate than needed,\n  # but we want to test django_compressor's compressing which\n  # needs a media url and root and so.\n\n  # Set COMPRESS to True if you want to test compression when\n  # DEBUG == True.  (By default, COMPRESS is the opposite of\n  # DEBUG).\n  COMPRESS = False\n\n  # SETTINGS_DIR allows media paths and so to be relative to\n  # this settings file instead of hardcoded to\n  # c:\\only\\on\\my\\computer.\n  SETTINGS_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n\n  # BUILDOUT_DIR is for access to the \"surrounding\" buildout,\n  # for instance for BUILDOUT_DIR/var/static files to give\n  # django-staticfiles a proper place to place all collected\n  # static files.\n  BUILDOUT_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SETTINGS_DIR, '..'))\n\n  # Absolute path to the directory that holds user-uploaded\n  # media.\n  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'media')\n  # Absolute path to the directory where django-staticfiles'\n  # \"bin/django build_static\" places all collected static\n  # files from all applications' /media directory.\n  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'static')\n\n  # URL that handles the media served from MEDIA_ROOT. Make\n  # sure to use a trailing slash if there is a path component\n  # (optional in other cases).\n  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'\n  # URL for the per-application /media static files collected\n  # by django-staticfiles.  Use it in templates like \"{{\n  # MEDIA_URL }}mypackage/my.css\".\n  STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'\n  # URL prefix for admin media -- CSS, JavaScript and\n  # images. Make sure to use a trailing slash.  Uses\n  # STATIC_URL as django-staticfiles nicely collects admin's\n  # static media into STATIC_ROOT/admin.\n  ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'\n\n  # Storage engine to be used during compression\n  COMPRESS_STORAGE = \"staticfiles.storage.StaticFileStorage\"\n  # The URL that linked media will be read from and compressed\n  # media will be written to.\n  COMPRESS_URL = STATIC_URL\n  # The absolute file path that linked media will be read from\n  # and compressed media will be written to.\n  COMPRESS_ROOT = STATIC_ROOT\n\n\n  # Used for django-staticfiles\n  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (\n      # Default items.\n      \"django.core.context_processors.auth\",\n      \"django.core.context_processors.debug\",\n      \"django.core.context_processors.i18n\",\n      \"django.core.context_processors.media\",\n      # Needs to be added for django-staticfiles to allow you\n      # to use {{ STATIC_URL }}myapp/my.css in your templates.\n      'staticfiles.context_processors.static_url',\n      )\n\nAnd a suitable apache config hint::\n\n  <Location /static_media/>\n    # The css/javascript/image staticfiles are cached in the\n    # browser for a day.\n    ExpiresActive On\n    ExpiresDefault \"access plus 1 day\"\n  </Location>\n\n  <Location /static_media/CACHE/>\n    # django_compress's generated timestamp'ed files:\n    # cache forever\n    ExpiresActive On\n    ExpiresDefault \"access plus 10 years\"\n  </Location>\n\n  # Static files are hosted by apache itself.\n  # User-uploaded media: MEDIA_URL = '/media/'\n  Alias /media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/media/\n  # django-staticfiles: STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'\n  Alias /static_media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/static/\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou can mount lizard-ui's urls, but it contains only live examples.  So\nperhaps you should only mount it in debug mode under ``/ui``.  Handy, as it\ncontains reasonably full documentation on how to use it, including available\nblocks and classes/IDs that you can use.\n\nThe base layout is defined in ``realbase.html``.  You should however extend\n``lizard_ui/lizardbase.html`` and then override the blocks that you want.\n\nCSS and javascript should be added to the relevant blocks, but don't forget to\ncall \"block.super\".  An example::\n\n  {% extends \"lizard_ui/lizardbase.html\" %}\n\n  {% block css %}\n  {{ block.super }}\n  <link type=\"text/css\"\n        href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.css\"\n        media=\"screen, projection\"\n        rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n  {% endblock css %}\n\n  {% block javascript %}\n  {{ block.super }}\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\"\n          src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}openlayers/OpenLayers.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\"\n          src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/jquery.workspace.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\"\n          src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.js\"></script>\n  {% endblock javascript %}\n\n  {% block content %}\n  <div id=\"map\"></div>\n  {% endblock content %}\n\nA example of a common task: change the logo.  For that, make a\n``media/lizard_ui`` directory in your django application (or site) and place a\n``logo.png`` in it.  Django-staticfiles' mechanism will take your logo.png in\npreference to lizard-ui's.\n\n\nDevelopment installation\n------------------------\n\nThe first time, you'll have to run the \"bootstrap\" script to set up setuptools\nand buildout::\n\n    $> python bootstrap.py\n\nAnd then run buildout to set everything up::\n\n    $> bin/buildout\n\n(On windows it is called ``bin\\buildout.exe``).\n\nYou'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in\n``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.\n\nThe current package is installed as a \"development package\", so\nchanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python\nsetup.py develop``).\n\nIf you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released\nversions), add them as an \"svn external\" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory\nand add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.\n\nTests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\\test.exe``.\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\n- Document all of the available classes/IDs that you can use to get automatic\n  (javascript) behaviour.\n\n- Document the javascript code.\n\n- Add basic test that the example.html renders without errors.\n\n- Add javascript tests for the javascript code, ideally.\n\n- Add mechanism for rendering a passed-in (or registered/configured) list of\n  object_tabs and object_actions, including some nice formatting.\n\n- Add mechanism for breadcrumbs.\n\n- Important: add tests for the login functionality.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- TODO started this library\n\n\nChangelog of lizard-ui\n======================\n\n\n1.66 (2011-06-16)\n-----------------\n\n- Added error message when next accordion pane fails to load.\n\n\n1.65 (2011-06-10)\n-----------------\n\n- Added reloadLocalizedGraphs() in addition to reloadGraphs() to reload only\n  graphs inside a certain div. (Used in lizard-map popups with tabs).\n\n- Added Tipsy (Facebook/Github-style tooltips https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy)\n\n- Added buttons.css (from https://github.com/ubuwaits/css3-buttons)\n\n- Some repeatable backgrounds. (from http://subtlepatterns.com/)\n\n- Some icons from http://glyphicons.com/, added/implemented seperately.\n  (TODO: integrate properly in sprite.png and the stylesheet of silk)\n\n- OpenLayers 'Dark' theme.\n\n- Re-exported several icon PNG's (meldingen, kaarten) with an alphachannel\n  drop-shadow.\n\n- Added extra field to ApplicationScreen model. (description, for display in\n  tipsy tooltips)\n\n- Centered the icons in the 'iphonesque' app-screen.\n\n- Added inset drop-shadows to the app-screen.\n\n- Changed the app-screen font to helvetica-light. (TODO: Try out Google\n  Webfonts instead)\n\n- Changed gray H2 bars' bevel to a higher contrast, expressing more depth.\n\n- Aligned lizard logo to the outmost left.\n.\n- Added tooltips to several interface elements.\n\n- Improved appearance of the breadcrumb. (TODO: position is still a bit\n  awkward?)\n\n- Changed OpenLayers javascript + css so that the layer chooser's\n  background color matches the rest of the dark theme.\n\n\n1.64 (2011-06-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed accordion behaviour. All titles are refreshed, but we don't refresh\n  all pane contents anymore: only the new one. This makes sure trees stay\n  expanded. And it reduces re-rendering time for big trees. And we\n  theoretically don't need to send over all the panes' data in case that's\n  prohibitive for performance.\n\n\n1.63 (2011-05-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed relative positioning on #portal-tabs. See ticket #2827.\n- Reverted my changes made to .sidebarbox-action-icon in changeset:21174. Even\n  added 1px extra to better vertically align workspace items. See ticket #2750\n  for screenshots.\n- Added a extra class name for save_form.\n- Bigger portal-tabs with rounded corners.\n- Corrected text-align of wrong-login.\n- \"Log in\" and \"Log uit\" links have the same cursor: they were different and\n  \"Log uit\" had an illogical one, viz. cursor:text.\n\n\n1.62 (2011-05-18)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed vertical location of workspaceitem icons that aren't part of a header.\n\n\n1.61 (2011-05-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixing menubar at 2em height to keep longer content from overflowing the\n  bar.\n\n- Added favicon image in ``media/lizard_ui/favicon.ico``. So if you want a\n  different favicon in your project, place an updated icon in your site's\n  ``media/lizardui/`` folder.\n\n\n1.60 (2011-05-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed CSS of .workspace (#2659).\n\n- Added five custom icons. (Gijs, req. by Dave)\n\n- Downgraded to jQuery 1.5.1 due to IE8 bug in 1.5.2.\n  See https://office.nelen-schuurmans.nl/trac/ticket/2656#comment:5\n  See http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8755\n\n\n1.59 (2011-04-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Deleted 'Copyright @ Nelen ...' text.\n\n\n1.58 (2011-04-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Added dacom icon.\n\n- Updated tabs css (needed for lizard-map >= 1.71).\n\n\n1.57 (2011-04-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Added new flooding icon flooding2.png.\n\n- Updated OpenLayers from 2.8 to 2.10.\n\n- Jslint lizard.js.\n\n\n1.56 (2011-04-14)\n-----------------\n\n- Updated Lizard logo.\n\n- Added lizard_ui/tabs.css.\n\n- Updated jQuery from 1.4.2 to 1.5.2, jQuery UI from 1.8.2 to 1.8.11,\n  jQueryTools from 1.2.2 to 1.2.5. Treeview from 1.4 to 1.4.1.\n\n- Added css class for progress animation image\n\n\n1.55 (2011-04-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Added 3di icon.\n\n- Added Waterbalance icon.\n\n\n1.54 (2011-03-18)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed width: 100% css for .auto-inserted. It works fine without\n  it. Before the image was slightly scaled horizontally.\n\n- Added possibility for a double-height item in the\n  divideVerticalSpaceEqually() method.  Just add a\n  \"double-vertical-item\" class instead of \"vertical-item\" to the item\n  you want to give double the height.\n\n\n1.53 (2011-03-09)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed setUpWorkspaceAcceptableButtons. The button is now added\n  when a workspace-acceptable is clicked (lizard-map 1.58 and higher).\n\n- Adding error message when a \"replace-with-image\" image is loaded and\n  there's an error. Instead of an ever-spinning \"loading...\" icon.\n\n\n1.52 (2011-02-23)\n-----------------\n\n- Centered the progress animation.\n\n- Added data-src to progress animation (for debugging purposes).\n\n\n1.51 (2011-02-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Added progress animation to vertical-item / img-use-my-size /\n  replace-with-image.\n\n\n1.50 (2011-02-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Added icons dike and controlnext.\n\n\n1.36 (2011-02-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Added application screens and icons support: added models and views.\n\n\n1.35 (2011-02-02)\n-----------------\n\n- Refactored the window.resize function in lizard.js [Gijs].\n\n\n1.34 (2011-02-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Added breadcrumbs example.\n\n- Added new breadcrumbs method. See examples.\n\n- Added protovis library.\n\n- Added support for portal-tabs, see also the examples page.\n\n\n1.33 (2011-01-24)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed preventDefault in logout function.\n\n\n1.32 (2011-01-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Still trying to fix logout bug.\n\n\n1.31 (2011-01-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed logout bug.\n\n\n1.30 (2011-01-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Added turtle app icon.\n\n- After logging out one goes back to \"/\".\n\n- Improved login function.\n\n- Added (empty) login screen with redirect option.\n\n\n1.29 (2011-01-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Added &nbsp; to workspace acceptable button.\n\n\n1.28 (2011-01-12)\n-----------------\n\n- Added setUpWorkspaceAcceptableButtons in lizard.js. The function is\n  in lizard-ui because setUpAccordion needs the function as well.\n\n\n1.27 (2010-12-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Loading accordions re-initializes tree structures.\n\n\n1.26 (2010-12-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Added default 500 and 404 pages.\n\n\n1.25 (2010-12-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Added custom templatetag dutch_timedelta.\n\n- Moved tooltip css from lizard_map to here.\n\n- Add optional description to tree snippet.\n\n\n1.24 (2010-11-24)\n-----------------\n\n- Added css class action-icon.\n\n\n1.23 (2010-11-11)\n-----------------\n\n- (Re-)initializes tooltips when loading accordion.\n\n- Added setUpTooltips() in lizard.js.\n\n\n1.22 (2010-11-09)\n-----------------\n\n- Updated accordion: when an item is clicked, all panes and headers\n  are updated.\n\n\n1.21 (2010-10-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Fix \"apple\" icon height to 80px.\n\n\n1.20 (2010-10-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed IE7 print problem.\n\n- Added exception-logging middleware.\n\n- Added app_icons.\n\n- Added sidebar and sidebarbox css entries.\n\n- Added tree_snippet.html template for creating trees.\n\n\n1.19 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed float problem for IE in login popup.\n\n- Fixing visibility of \"restore from print view\" icon in IE.\n\n\n1.18 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Added automatic print button that also allows you to expand the\n  collapsed-for-printing view again.\n\n- Tables now print with a grid and proper left/center/right alignment.\n\n- Links don't print anymore (at least, their url isn't appended anymore to the\n  link text when printing).\n\n\n1.17 (2010-09-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Add colorpicker js library.\n\n- Added createcoverage command.\n\n\n\n1.16 (2010-09-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Added more tests.\n\n- Small layout tweak for popup box.\n\n\n1.15 (2010-09-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Added utility templatetags.\n\n\n1.14 (2010-08-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Importing json via django now.\n\n\n1.13 (2010-08-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix simplejson.\n\n\n1.12 (2010-08-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Small adjustments to support lizard-map's new graph popup.  (A better\n  separation of lizard-ui and lizard-map is needed later on: after the\n  deadlines :-) ).\n\n\n1.11 (2010-08-26)\n-----------------\n\n- Styled the login form including proper \"enter\" behaviour and\n  first-field-gets-focus handling.\n\n\n1.10 (2010-08-26)\n-----------------\n\n- Moved some css styling from lizard-map to lizard-ui.\n\n- Added initial login support + forms.  You need to add lizard-ui's urls.py to\n  yours if you want to use it.\n\n- Better drag/drop visual feedback.\n\n\n1.8 (2010-08-18)\n----------------\n\n- Javascript syntax fix: added two semicolons and removed another.\n\n\n1.7 (2010-07-15)\n----------------\n\n- Make \"replace-with-image\" clickable by using \"data-href-click\"\n  property.\n\n- Add ol.forms css.\n\n\n1.6 (2010-07-06)\n----------------\n\n- Image replacement looks at \"use-my-size\" class instead of\n  use-my-width/height.\n\n- Added javascript \"printPage()\" function that prints a webpage that at least\n  doesn't flow over the right hand side of the physical paper page.  Printing\n  uses a combination of a custom print stylesheet and blueprint's print\n  stylesheet.  Printing definitively isn't perfect yet, but at least usable.\n  Note: you should refresh or resize the page after printing to get the full\n  width again.\n\n\n1.5 (2010-07-01)\n----------------\n\n- Added generic automatic image resizing (replacing a generic \"a href\" with an\n  image with the same src as the href and then figuring out the height/width\n  and passing that along as a GET parameter and as attributes on the img tag.\n\n- Fixed resize timer by having a global variable for it.\n\n- Calculating hiddenStuffHeight (currently: only the date popup hidden div)\n  only once: before the date popup has been opened..  Fixes the bug that you'd\n  get a large empty space at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n1.4.1 (2010-06-25)\n------------------\n\n- Updated TODO list.\n\n\n1.4 (2010-06-25)\n----------------\n\n- We're now on the python package index, hurray!\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui\n\n- Updated package metadata.\n\n- Big README documentation update.\n\n\n1.3 (2010-06-23)\n----------------\n\n- Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.\n\n- UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in\n  corner cases, for instance).\n\n\n1.2 (2010-06-22)\n----------------\n\n- Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with\n  javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.\n\n- The main body has \"overflow: hidden\" to get rid of scrollbars once and for\n  all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A\n  scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have\n  an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is\n  perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual\n  content).\n\n\n1.1 (2010-06-18)\n----------------\n\n- IE tweaks.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-06-17)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed javascript code with jslint.\n\n- Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.\n  You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your\n  settings and add \"compressor\" to your installed apps.\n\n- Switched to a separate \"javascript\" and \"css\" block instead of the\n  site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when\n  you override the blocks.\n\n\n0.12 (2010-06-11)\n-----------------\n\n- Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).\n\n- Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'\n  implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our\n  existing sidebar css.\n\n\n0.11 (2010-06-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base\n  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.\n\n\n0.10 (2010-06-07)\n-----------------\n\n- Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().\n\n- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.\n\n\n0.9 (2010-06-03)\n----------------\n\n- Using jquery's live() for \"late binding\" of events to elements added later\n  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.\n\n\n0.8 (2010-06-01)\n----------------\n\n- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.\n\n\n0.7 (2010-05-18)\n----------------\n\n- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.\n\n- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed\n  div at the bottom.\n\n- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.\n\n\n0.6 (2010-04-28)\n----------------\n\n- Added collapsible sidebar.\n\n- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The\n  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up\n  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so\n  switching back to blueprint is now possible.\n\n- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.\n\n\n0.5 (2010-04-13)\n----------------\n\n- Layout improvements.\n\n- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).\n\n- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.\n\n- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't\n  included automatically anymore.\n\n- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.\n\n\n0.4 (2010-03-16)\n----------------\n\n- Added extjs javascript library.\n\n- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.\n\n\n0.3.1 (2010-03-05)\n------------------\n\n- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.\n\n\n0.3 (2010-03-05)\n----------------\n\n- Added openlayers 2.8.\n\n- Added famfamfam silk icon set.\n\n- Added background to menubar, footer and body.\n\n- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.\n\n\n0.2 (2010-02-12)\n----------------\n\n- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in\n  templates.  We're well-behaved now!\n\n\n0.1 (2010-02-12)\n----------------\n\n- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.\n\n- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript\n  resources.\n\n- Added blueprint css framework.\n\n- Initial structure created by nensskel.",
