    "description": "# LUDOpy\n\nThis is a implementation of the LUDO game in python for use in AI or whatever you want.  \n\nFor normal use of ludopy only ludopy.Game should be needed.\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ludopy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ludopy) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ludopy/badge/?version=latest)](https://ludopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) ![Python application](https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)\n\n# Installation\n- Recommended: Install ludopy from PyPI: \n```sh\npip install ludopy\n```\n- Alternatively: install ludopy from the GitHub source:\n\nFirst, clone ludopy using `git`:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy\n```\n\nThen, `cd` to the folder and run the install command:\n```sh\ncd LUDOpy\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Random \"walk\" example:\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy/blob/master/demo/random_walk.ipynb)\n```python\nimport ludopy\nimport numpy as np\n\ng = ludopy.Game()\nthere_is_a_winner = False\n\nwhile not there_is_a_winner:\n    (dice, move_pieces, player_pieces, enemy_pieces, player_is_a_winner, there_is_a_winner), player_i = g.get_observation()\n\n    if len(move_pieces):\n        piece_to_move = move_pieces[np.random.randint(0, len(move_pieces))]\n    else:\n        piece_to_move = -1\n\n    _, _, _, _, _, there_is_a_winner = g.answer_observation(piece_to_move)\n\nprint(\"Saving history to numpy file\")\ng.save_hist(f\"game_history.npy\")\nprint(\"Saving game video\")\ng.save_hist_video(f\"game_video.mp4\")\n```\n\n## The rules of the game:\n\n### The dice\nA a six-sided dice is used. With it, you have to hit six to move a piece out of the starting area, \nwhile all other throws give the right to move a piece the number of fields the eyes show.\nExtra throws are given when hitting six (no limit to how many times in a row). \n\n### At the start\nPlayers take turns alternating with the dice.\nAt the stroke of 6, you have the right to throw a piece out on the board.\nIf all the pieces are in the starting field, you have three attempts to beat a 6.\nPlayers turn in turn in a clockwise direction (player 1 to 4).\n\n### The course of the game\nA 6's entitles you to an extra roll.\nThe player moves the number of squares corresponding to the eyes of the dice. \nIf you land in a field where there is already a piece, the first arrived piece must return to\nstarting field. If, on the other hand, there are two pieces on the field, then the last to arrive has to return to the starting field.\nYou have to move a piece (if there is one that can be moved), even if it means you have to back to start.\nIf you cannot move forward, you must stand for the next turn.\n\n### Fields\nOn the playing board there are several special areas and fields.\n\n- The starting area is where the four pieces start. To take a piece out of the starting area, you have to hit a six. If you have all your pieces in the starting area, you get up to three strokes with the dice before the tour is passed.\n- The target area is where the four pieces should end and can get to the goal. Each player has their own target area, and no other player is allowed to take their pieces in there. To reach the end of the target area (the goal), it must hit precisely - otherwise you have to move your piece in the opposite direction by the amount you have leftover.\n- Globus fields protect the pieces from being knocked home. If an opponent's piece lands on a protected piece, it is hit home. However, there is an exception to the colored globe fields. For example, only red chips can be protected in the red globe field, regardless of the number of chips in the field. If you have two pieces standing on the opponent's colored globe, they can both be knocked home.\n- Star fields act as shortcuts that can bring the pieces faster to the target area. If a piece lands on a star, it must be moved to the next star. If it is the star in front of the target area that lands on, the chip is moved directly to the goal.\n\n### The winner\nThe one who first gets all 4 pieces in the goal is the winner. (But you choose if the game ends there or if the other players still has to fight)\nGoal are the center. When you have entered the colored fields you can not be hit home.\nThe piece has to be move precisely into the goal otherwise the piece are struck back the exact number of eyes there are to many.\n\nThe rules are taken from this danish site: http://spilregler.dk/ludo/\n\n## The Board\n\nThe number inside a piece indicate how many pieces that are at the same tail\n\n### Example 1\n\n![The image show a example of the board](https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy/blob/master/board_example.png?raw=true \"Board example\")\n\n### Example 2\n\n![The image show a example of the board](https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy/blob/master/board_example_2.png?raw=true \"Board example 2\")\n\n### Example of the index method (shown for player 1)\n\nHere the number indicate which index the piece are at\n\n![Example of the index method (shown for player 1)](https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy/blob/master/track.png?raw=true \"Index method\")\n\n\n",
