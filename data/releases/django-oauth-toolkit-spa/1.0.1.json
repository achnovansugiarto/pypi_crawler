It relies on [Django REST framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework)\nand [Django Oauth Toolkit](https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe django-oauth-toolkit by default sends back access token and refresh token both in response body. This presents a \ndilemma for web developers as to where to store/persist each token:\n\n- Web storage (local storage and session storage) is accessible through Javascript on the same domain, this presents an \nopportunity for malicious scripts running on your site to carry out XSS against your user clients, which makes web \nstorage not ideal for storing either access or refresh tokens. There are a large number of scenarios where XSS can take\nplace, and a number of ways to mitigate them. you can read more about XSS [here](https://gist.github.com/oscarychen/352d60c1a2e3727d444c94b5959bb6f6).\n- Cookies with `HttpOnly` flag are not accessible by Javascript and therefore not vulnerable to XSS, however they may be\nthe target of CSRF attack because of ambient authority, where cookies may be attached to requests automatically. Even \nthough a malicious website carrying out a CSRF has no way of reading the response of the request which is made on behalf \nof a user, they may be able to make changes to user data resources if such endpoints exist. This makes `HttpOnly` \ncookies unsuited for storing access token. There are several ways to mitigate CSRF, such as setting the `SameSite`\nattribute of a cookie to \"Lax\" or \"Strict\", and using anti-CSRF token. You can read more about CSRF [here](https://gist.github.com/oscarychen/ce189b2fef1f8ff7eac51a72fed34960).\n\nIn addition to various XSS and CSRF mitigation techniques, this package deploys access token and refresh token for web \napps in a specific way that broadly hardens application security against these attacks:\n- Access tokens, are as usual, send back to clients in response body. It is expected that you would design your frontend\napplication to not persist access tokens anywhere. They are short-lived and only used by the SPA in memory, and are \ntossed as soon as the user close the browser tab. This way, the access token cannot be utilized in a CSRF attack against\nyour application.\n- Refresh tokens, are sent back to client in a `HttpOnly` cookie header that the client browser sees but inaccessible \nby your own frontend application. This way, the refresh token is not subject to any XSS attack against your application.\nWhile CSRF is possible, the attacker cannot use this mechanism to make modification to your resources even is a CSRF \nattack is successfully carried out. It is important to note that in CSRF, the attacker cannot read the response even\nwhen they successfully make the malicious request to your API endpoint; the worst they can do is to refresh the token\non user's behalf, and no damage can be done. The refresh token cookie would also typically have `domain` and `path`\nattributes specified, so that browsers should only attach them with request to your domain and specific url path\nused for refreshing the tokens, therefore reducing attack surfaces further.\n\n## Quick start\n\nInstall using pip:\n\n```\npip install django-oauth-toolkit-spa\n```\n\nOr, install from source:\n\nSet\nup [django-oauth-toolkit and django REST framework](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest-framework/getting_started.html#step-1-minimal-setup) if you haven't already:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n    ...,\n    'oauth2_provider',\n    'rest_framework',\n)\n```\n\n```python\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (\n        'oauth2_provider.contrib.rest_framework.OAuth2Authentication',\n    )\n}\n```\n\nInclude the oauth_toolkit_spa URLconf in your project urls.py:\n\n```python\npath('auth/', include('oauth_toolkit_spa.urls')),\n```\n\n## Settings\n\ndjango-oauth-toolkit's settings are largely extended and used, except few default values have been overwritten. These\nsettings are used as default unless explicitly specified:\n\n```\n\"ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS\": 300,\n\"REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS\": 36000,\n\"REFRESH_COOKIE_NAME\": \"refresh_token\",\n\"REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH\": \"/auth\"\n```\n\nYou can modify these settings by specifying them in the settings for django-oauth-toolkit:\n\n```python\nOAUTH2_PROVIDER = {\n    ...,\n    \"ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS\": 300,\n    \"REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS\": 36000,\n    \"REFRESH_COOKIE_NAME\": \"refresh_token\",\n    \"REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH\": \"/auth\",\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to use a different path for authentication than the default path, you should provide the setting\nin `REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH`, using a string with leading slash `/`; while provide the same path in URLconf but with a\ntrailing slash `/`.\n",
