    "description": "Introspection for the ``logging`` logger tree in the Standard Library.\n\nYou can install this package with the standard ``pip`` command::\n\n    $ pip install logging_tree\n\nWhile you can write programs that call this package's ``tree()``\nfunction and examine the hierarchy of logger objects that it finds\ninside of the Standard Library ``logging`` module, the simplest use of\nthis package for debugging is to call ``printout()`` to print the\nloggers, filters, and handlers that your application has configured::\n\n    >>> logging.getLogger('a')\n    >>> logging.getLogger('a.b').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    >>> logging.getLogger('x.c')\n    >>> from logging_tree import printout\n    >>> printout()\n    <--\"\"\n       Level WARNING\n       |\n       o<--\"a\"\n       |   Level NOTSET so inherits level WARNING\n       |   |\n       |   o<--\"a.b\"\n       |       Level DEBUG\n       |\n       o<--[x]\n           |\n           o<--\"x.c\"\n               Level NOTSET so inherits level WARNING\n\nThe logger tree should always print successfully, no matter how\ncomplicated.  A node whose ``[name]`` is in square brackets is a \"place\nholder\" that has never actually been named in a ``getLogger()`` call,\nbut was created automatically to serve as the parent of loggers further\ndown the tree.\n\nThere are several interfaces that ``logging_tree`` supports, depending\non how much detail you need.\n\n``logging_tree.printout(node=None)``\n\n    Prints the current logger tree, or the tree based at the given\n    `node`, to the standard output.\n\n``logging_tree.format.build_description(node=None)``\n\n    Builds and returns the multi-line description of the current logger\n    tree, or the tree based at the given ``node``, as a single string\n    with newlines inside and a newline at the end.\n\n``logging_tree.format.describe(node)``\n\n    A generator that yields a series of lines that describe the tree\n    based at the given ``node``.  Note that the lines are returned\n    without newline terminators attached.\n\n``logging_tree.tree()``\n\n    Fetch the current tree of loggers from the ``logging`` module.\n    Returns a node, that is simply a tuple with three fields:\n\n    | ``[0]`` the logger name (``\"\"`` for the root logger).\n    | ``[1]`` the ``logging.Logger`` object itself.\n    | ``[2]`` a list of zero or more child nodes.\n\nI welcome contributions and ideas as this package matures.  You can find\nthe bug tracker at the `repository page on github\n<https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/logging_tree>`_.  Developers can run\nthis package's tests with::\n\n    $ python -m unittest discover logging_tree\n\nOn older versions of Python you will instead have to install\n``unittest2`` and use its ``unit2`` command line tool to run the tests.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n**Version 1.8.1** - 2020 January 26\n    Adjust one test to make it pass under Python 3.8, and update the\n    distribution classifiers to declare compatibility with Python\n    versions through 3.8.\n\n**Version 1.8** - 2018 August 5\n    Improve the output to better explain what happens if a \"parent\"\n    attribute has been set to None.\n\n**Version 1.7** - 2016 January 23\n    Detect whether each logger has the correct \"parent\" attribute and,\n    if not, print where its log messages are being sent instead.\n\n**Version 1.6** - 2015 January 8\n    Fixed a crash that would occur if a custom logging Formatter was\n    missing its format string attributes.\n\n**Version 1.5** - 2014 December 24\n    Handlers now display their logging level if one has been set, and\n    their custom logging formatter if one has been installed.\n\n**Version 1.4** - 2014 January 8\n    Thanks to a contribution from Dave Brondsema, disabled loggers are\n    now actually marked as \"Disabled\" to make it less of a surprise that\n    they fail to log anything.\n\n**Version 1.3** - 2013 October 29\n    Be explicit and display the logger level ``NOTSET`` along with the\n    effective level inherited from the logger's ancestors; and display\n    the list of ``.filters`` of a custom logging handler even though it\n    might contain custom code that ignores them.\n\n**Version 1.2** - 2013 January 19\n    Compatible with Python 3.3 thanks to @ralphbean.\n\n**Version 1.1** - 2012 February 17\n    Now compatible with 2.3 <= Python <= 3.2.\n\n**Version 1.0** - 2012 February 13\n    Can display the handler inside a MemoryHandler; entire public\n    interface documented; 100% test coverage.\n\n**Version 0.6** - 2012 February 10\n    Added a display format for every ``logging.handlers`` class.\n\n**Version 0.5** - 2012 February 8\n    Initial release.\n\n",
