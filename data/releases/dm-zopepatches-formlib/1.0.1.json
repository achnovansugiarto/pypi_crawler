    "description": "This package allows to work around\nproblems/weaknesses in ``zope.formlib`` and the associated widgets in \n``zope.app.form.browser``,\ndescribed by \"https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/528920\"\nand \"https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/528912\".\n\nThe package has been developed for Zope 2.10, will probably work for Zope 2.11\nand is unlikely to work for very new Zope versions, because the widget\ncode has been moved from ``zope.app.form`` to ``zope.formlib``.\nI may publish versions of this package for new Zope versions in the future.\n\nThe package consists of various modules described below.\n\nTo use the package in your application, you import some of its\npatch functions (mentioned below) and call them during the startup\nof your application.\n\nI hope that corresponding patches will sooner or later appear in the\nstandard Zope code and make this package obsolete.\n\n\nform\n----\n\nTogether with ``widget``, this module is destined to work\naround http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10264 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/528920.\n\n``zope.formlib`` distinguishes between widget related errors\nand other (more global) errors. If a widget itself detects a\nwidget related error (usually because a restriction for the\nassociated field fails), it sets its error condition.\nThis error condition is usually used to highlight the widget containing an\nerror and to provide information about this error.\nHowever, if the widget related error is not detected by the\nwidget itself, the error is not associated with the widget and\nimportant information may be missing.\n\nThe function ``patch_action()`` in module ``form`` enhances\n``zope.formlib.form.Action`` by an additional method\n``associate_errors_with_widgets`` and redefines its\n``failure`` method to call it unless an explicit failure handler is specified.\nThis provides for automatic error association with the widgets\nin the standard case.\n\n``associate_errors_with_widgets`` tries to associate\n``zope.app.form.interfaces.WidgetInputError`` with\nthe corresponding widget. For this purpose, the widget\nmust have a ``setWidgetInputError`` method.\nBy default widgets lack this method. However ``widget.patch_widget()``\ncan be used to define it. Therefore, ``form.patch_action()``\nand ``widget.patch_widget()`` are usually used together.\n\n\nwidget\n------\nTogether with ``form``, this module is destined to work\naround http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10264 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/528920.\n\nIts ``patch_widget()`` enhances\n``zope.app.form.browser.widget.BrowserWidget`` (the base class for\n``zope.app.form`` widgets) by defining the method ``setWidgetInputError``.\nThe method allows external code to set an error condition on the widget.\n\n``setWidgetInputError`` is used by the error handling implemented\nby the ``form`` module. Therefore, ``widget.patch_widget()`` is usually\nused together with ``form.patch_action()``.\n\n\nmultiselection\n--------------\n\nThis module is destined to work around\nhttp://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10267 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/528912.\n\nIts ``patch_OrderedMultiSelectWidget()``\nfixes ``zope.app.form.browser.itemswidgets.OrderedMultiSelectWidget``.",
