    "description": "# django-eremaea2\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-eremaea2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-eremaea2)\n\ndjango-eremaea2 is a simple [Django] application to store and manage webcam image snapshots.\nThe application is built on top of [django-rest-framework] and provides REST API to access the files.\n\nThere are three kind of resources available through REST API interface.\nA *collection* is a collection of *snapshots*.\nA *snapshot* is image file in essence.\nFor any *snapshot* there is a *retention policy* associated with to specify how long store the file.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe following prerequisites are required to operate django-eremaea2:\n* [django-rest-framework] - powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs.\n* [dj-inmemorystorage] - a non-persistent in-memory data storage backend for Django (required for testing).\n\nTo use django-eremaea2 in your django project, include the following code into your ```settings.py```:\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n     #...\n    'rest_framework',\n    'eremaea',\n)\n```\n\nInto your ```urls.py``` you have to add the following:\n```\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    #...\n    url(r'^eremaea/', include('eremaea.urls')),\n)\n```\n\n## Configuration\nThe whole configuration is stored into the project database, there is not separate dedicated config file.\n\nThe ```RetentionPolicy``` model has two parameters: a lookup field ```name``` and ```duration``` that specifies time-to-live for associated objects.\nTo perform actual cleanup a POST request to the endpoint ```http://example.com/eremaea/retention_policies/{name}/purge``` is required.\nThe ```Collection``` model has two parameters: a lookup field ```name``` and ```default_retention_policy```.\nThe ```Snapshot``` model has the following field: associated ```collection`` and ```retention_policy```, ```file``` object, and auto-now ```date```.\nNew images are uploaded by POST request to the endpoint ```http://example.com/eremaea/snapshots/?collection=collection_name&retention_policy=retention_policy_name```.\nThe latest query parameter is optional one.\n\nThe other ways to configure the application are Django fixtures, Django admin interface, [django-rest-framework] web browsable interface, and REST API itself.\n\n## Authentication and permissions\nYou may utilise all possible options provided by [django-rest-framework]. See [Tutorial](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/) for reference.\n\n## Caching\nYou may utilise all caching mechanisms provided by [Django] framework. See [Django's cache framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/).\n\n## Feedback\nIf you have any questions, issues, or pull-requests, you are welcome to use GitHub infrastructure.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016, Matwey V.
