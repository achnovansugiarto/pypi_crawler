Any\n      element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time. Haskell is a standardized,\n      general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics\n      and strong static typing. Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished\n      values. Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes\n      and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within\n      an atom.\n    title: They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the\n      first character being lowercase.\n  model: posts.post\n  pk: 3\n- fields:\n    category: T\n    is_publish: false\n    published_date: 2006-06-24 11:19:25.527136\n    text: Haskell features a type system with type inference and lazy evaluation.\n      It is also a garbage-collected runtime system. Messages can be sent to and received\n      from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called \"port protocol.\" The\n      sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and\n      dynamic typing.
