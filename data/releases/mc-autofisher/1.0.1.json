    "description": "# MinecraftAutoFisher\n\n## Description\nThe goal of fishing in Minecraft is to cast your line and wait until the fishing bobber bobs in the water.\nIf you click quickly enough when that happens, you'll reel in a fish (or some treasure!).\n\nThis program ~~cheats~~ automates this process for you by watching the subtitles on the screen; When the bobber bobs,\nit makes a splashing sound and if you have subtitles enabled the text 'Fishing Bobber splashes' appears. This program watches\nthe screen and right clicks whenever it sees that text, allowing it to keep reeling in fish as long as you leave it running.\n\n## Installation\nRequires [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)\n\nMore details to come\n\n## Usage\nFirst, run `screengrabber.py`. This will open up a slightly transparent window, and you should click and drag a rectangle over\nthe area the subtitles usually appear on your screen. This will tell the program where to look for the subtitles, and only\nneeds to be done once.\n\nSecond, run `fisher.py`, which will begin watching the part of the screen you selected for the text \"Fishing Bobber splashes\"\n(make sure you have your subtitles turned on in the Minecraft settings!). Then just cast your fishing rod and leave it running!\nThe program will right click whenever it sees the text to reel in the fish, then right click again to recast the line, giving\nyou an infinite supply of fish.\n> Note: If the program doesn't see the text for 45 seconds, it will think something is wrong and right click twice to recast\nthe line, make sure Minecraft is actually on screen or your computer will just right click every 45 seconds!\n\n\n",
