    "description": "Django Moderator\n================\n**Django community trained Bayesian inference based comment moderation app.**\n\n.. contents:: Contents\n    :depth: 5\n\n``django-moderator`` integrates Django's comments framework classify comments into one of four categories, *ham*, *spam*, *reported* or *unsure*.\n\nUsers classify comments as *reported* using a *report abuse* mechanic. Staff users can then classify these *reported* comments as *ham* or *spam*.\n\nComments classified as *spam* will have their ``is_removed`` field set to ``True`` and as such will no longer be visible in comment listings.\n\nComments *reported* by users will have their ``is_removed`` field set to ``True`` and as such will no longer be visible in comment listings.\n\nComments classified as *ham* or *unsure* will remain unchanged and as such will be visible in comment listings.\n\n``django-moderator`` also implements a user friendly admin interface for efficiently moderating comments.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n#. Install or add ``django-moderator`` to your Python path.\n\n#. Add ``moderator`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.\n\n#. Configure ``django-likes`` as described `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-likes>`_.\n\n#. Configure ``django-celery`` and add ``moderator.tasks`` to the ``CELERY_IMPORTS = (..., 'moderator.tasks')``\n\n#. Add a ``MODERATOR`` setting to your project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies what classifier storage backend to use (see below) and also classification thresholds::\n\n    MODERATOR = {\n        'ABUSE_CUTOFF': 3,\n    }\n\n   `ABUSE_CUTOFF`` value of ``3`` as in this example specifies that any comment receiving ``3`` or more abuse reports will be classified as *reported*, awaiting further manual staff user classification.\n\n#. Optionally, if you want an additional **moderate** object tool on admin change views, configure ``django-apptemplates`` as described `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-apptemplates>`_ , include ``moderator`` as an ``INSTALLED_APP`` before ``django.contrib.admin`` and add ``moderator.admin.AdminModeratorMixin`` as a base class to those admin classes you want the tool available for.\n\nAdditional Settings\n-------------------\n#. By default moderator comment replies are posted chronologically **after** the comment being replied to. If however you need replies to be posted **before** the comment being replied to(for example if you display your comments reverse cronologically), you can specify ``REPLY_BEFORE_COMMENT`` as ``True``, i.e.::\n\n    MODERATOR = {\n        ...\n        'REPLY_BEFORE_COMMENT': True,\n        ...\n    }\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nPraekelt Foundation\n-------------------\n* Shaun Sephton\n* Milton Madanda\n* Simon de Haan\n\nChangelog\n=========\n1.0.5 (2014-01-15)\n------------------\n#.
