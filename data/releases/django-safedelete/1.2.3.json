(cascading soft delete)\n - it can be normally deleted (hard delete)\n - it can be hard-deleted, but if its deletion would delete other objects, it will only be masked\n - it can be never deleted or masked from your database (no delete, use with caution)\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # imports\n    from safedelete.models import SafeDeleteModel\n    from safedelete.models import HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE\n\n    # Models\n\n    # We create a new model, with the given policy : Objects will be hard-deleted, or soft deleted if other objects would have been deleted too.\n    class Article(SafeDeleteModel):\n        _safedelete_policy = HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE\n\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    class Order(SafeDeleteModel):\n        _safedelete_policy = HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE\n\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n        articles = models.ManyToManyField(Article)\n\n\n    # Example of use\n\n    >>> article1 = Article(name='article1')\n    >>> article1.save()\n\n    >>> article2 = Article(name='article2')\n    >>> article2.save()\n\n    >>> order = Order(name='order')\n    >>> order.save()\n    >>> order.articles.add(article1)\n\n    # This article will be masked, but not deleted from the database as it is still referenced in an order.\n    >>> article1.delete()\n\n    # This article will be deleted from the database.\n    >>> article2.delete()\n\n\nCompatibilities\n---------------\n\n* Branch 0.2.x is compatible with django >= 1.2\n* Branch 0.3.x is compatible with django >= 1.4\n* Branch 0.4.x is compatible with django >= 1.8\n* Branch 0.5.x is compatible with django >= 1.11\n* Branch 1.0.x, 1.1.x and 1.2.x are compatible with django >= 2.2\n\nCurrent branch (1.2.x) is tested with :\n\n*  Django 2.2 using python 3.5 to 3.9.\n*  Django 3.0 using python 3.6 to 3.9.\n*  Django 3.1 using python 3.6 to 3.9.\n*  Django 3.2 using python 3.6 to 3.9.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstalling from pypi (using pip). ::\n\n    pip install django-safedelete\n\n\nInstalling from github. ::\n\n    pip install -e git://github.com/makinacorpus/django-safedelete.git#egg=django-safedelete\n\nAdd ``safedelete`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        'safedelete',\n        [...]\n    ]\n\n\nThe application doesn't have any special requirement.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nIn the main django settings you can activate the boolean variable ``SAFE_DELETE_INTERPRET_UNDELETED_OBJECTS_AS_CREATED``.\nIf you do this the ``update_or_create()`` function from django's standard manager class will return ``True`` for\nthe ``created`` variable if the object was soft-deleted and is now \"revived\".\n\nBy default, the field that indicates a database entry is soft-deleted is ``deleted``, however, you can override the field name\nusing the ``SAFE_DELETE_FIELD_NAME`` setting.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation is available `here <http://django-safedelete.readthedocs.org>`_. Generate your own documentation using:\n\n    tox -e docs\n\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nPlease see the LICENSE file.\n\nContacts\n--------\n\nPlease see the AUTHORS file.\n\n.. image:: https://drupal.org/files/imagecache/grid-3/Logo_slogan_300dpi.png\n    :target: http://www.makina-corpus.com\n\n\n=========\nCHANGELOG\n=========\n\n1.2.3 (2022-08-17)\n==================\n\n- Implement NO_DELETE and HARD_DELETE for queries #209\n- Soft-delete-cascade raises an exception when trying to delete a object that related object is PROTECT #210\n\n1.2.2 (2022-05-03)\n==================\n\n- Fix soft delete cascade for generic relations #207\n- Add count return to delete and undelete methods #204\n\n1.2.1 (2022-04-29)\n==================\n\n- Fix related_objects for non-safedelete models.\n\n1.2.0 (2022-04-26)\n==================\n\n- Adding SafeDeleteCascadeControlModel #197\n- Primary key uniqueness not considered in update_or_create #200\n\n1.1.2 (2021-12-16)\n==================\n\n- Add django 4.0 and python 3.10 compatibility and tests #191\n- Fix highlight_deleted_field translations #183 \n\n1.1.1 (2021-11-15)\n==================\n\n- Add highlight_deleted_field #177\n- Add new safedelete admin filter #175\n- Bug: has_unique_fields() returns false for models.UniqueConstraint #179\n\n1.1.0 (2021-09-23)\n==================\n\n- Fix attribute error when union queryset of safe delete model with others #152 \n- SET related objects after deleting #156\n- Avoiding recursive call for delete function. #121\n- Add SAFE_DELETE_FIELD_NAME setting #164\n- Move filter visibility logic to Query to fix subquery in annotations #160\n- Add functions to customize the policies delete behavior #167\n\n\n1.0.0 (2021-02-15)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for Django < 2.2\n- Fix deprecation warnings for Django 4.0\n\n0.5.7 (2021-01-28)\n==================\n\n- Add visibility filter for union operations #145\n- Set related fields when soft deleted #144\n- has_unique_fields() now takes into account unique_together option #147\n- Fix filtering in subqueries #148\n\n0.5.6 (2020-07-20)\n==================\n\n- call self.save() instead of super in delete()\n\n0.5.5 (2020-05-14)\n==================\n\n- Admin action now warns if some objects weren't undeleted\n- Remove some pre-Django 1.11 support\n\n0.5.4 (2019-12-02)\n==================\n\n- Django 3.0 compatibility\n\n0.5.3 (2019-12-02)\n==================\n\n- Fix \"Doing a .get on a queryset adds deleted objects #131\"\n\n0.5.2 (2019-08-19)\n==================\n\n- Fix performance issue with Django 2.2\n- Fix executing soft delete on already soft-deleted items during cascade soft delete\n\n0.5.1 (2018-07-02)\n==================\n\n- Fix possible unicode error in admin\n\n0.5.0 (2018-05-29)\n==================\n\n- Remove support for Django 1.8 to 1.10 and Python 3.3.\n     (it should still works for now but isn't tested, use at your own risks).\n- Fix update_or_create (#98)\n\n0.4.5 (2018-01-31)\n==================\n\n- Fix an issue with Django 1.8 and `values_list`\n- Django 2.0 compatibility\n\n\n0.4.4 (2018-01-09)\n==================\n\n** Bugfixes **\n\n- Fix latest and earliest\n\n0.4.3\n=====\n\n** Bugfixes **\n\n- Set SafeDeleteMixin as abstract\n\n\n0.4.2\n=====\n\n** Bugfixes **\n\n- iterator() now filter the deleted objects correctly.\n- Fix prefetch_related() with all()\n- Fix: \"Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken\" error.\n\n** Refactoring **\n\n- Resolve Django 1.9+ allow_tags deprecation warning\n- Fix docstring typo in SafeDeleteManager, SOFT_DELETE should be DELETED_INVISIBLE\n\n\n0.4.1\n=====\n\n** New **\n\n- Filtering on the deleted field is done on evaluation.\n- Added specific managers: all_objects and deleted_objects.\n- Added 'force_policy' feature to SafeDeleteQuerySet.\n\n** Removed **\n\n-\n\n** Bugfixes **\n\n- Fixed abstract intermediate models not working with SOFT_DELETE_CASCADE\n\n** Refactoring **\n\n- Renamed SafeDeleteMixin to SafeDeleteModel to better reflect the intended behavior.
