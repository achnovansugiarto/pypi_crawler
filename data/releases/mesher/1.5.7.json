    "description": "Mesher is a novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh generation to be generated from an arbitrary number of hydrologically important features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. \n      Triangle quality is guaranteed as well as a smooth graduation from small to large triangles. Including these additional features resulted in a better representation of spatial heterogeneity versus classic topography-only mesh generation.\n      The paper describing mesher can be `found here <https://www.usask.ca/hydrology/papers/Marsh,_et_al_2018.pdf>`_\n\n        Key points\n        \n        *  A novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software, Mesher\n        *  Heterogeneity in topography is resolved as well as hydrologically important surface and sub-surface attributes\n        *  Spatial heterogeneity is better preserved compared to existing mesh generators",
