    "description": "==================\nlocationsharinglib\n==================\n\nA library to retrieve coordinates from an google account that has been shared locations of other accounts.\n\n\n* Documentation: https://locationsharinglib.readthedocs.org/en/latest\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow\n====================\n\nThe workflow supports the following steps\n\n * lint\n * test\n * build\n * document\n * upload\n * graph\n\nThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.\nSourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.\n\nThe bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.\nIt is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the project\n\nOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.\nSo for the initial delivery one would call\n\n    $ _tag --minor\n\nwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.\n\n\nSo the full workflow after git is initialized is:\n\n * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )\n   * code\n   * lint\n   * test\n * commit and push\n * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle\n * tag (with the appropriate argument)\n * build\n * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi)\n * document (of course this could be run at any point)\n\n\nImportant Information\n=====================\n\nThis template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.\nSo when building a package out of this **do not** simple call\n\n    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg\n\n**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**\nInstead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.\n\n\n\nProject Features\n================\n\n* TODO\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n0.0.1 (24-12-2017)\n---------------------\n\n* First code creation\n\n\n4.0.0 (05-03-2019)\n------------------\n\n* Removed authentication mechanism and made the service expect an authenticated pickled requests session\n\n\n4.0.1 (06-03-2019)\n------------------\n\n* Removed wrongly placed files in the root of the virtual environment\n\n\n4.0.2 (07-07-2019)\n------------------\n\n* Fixes issue when the battery level is not reported by specific brands of mobiles\n\n\n4.1.0 (01-09-2019)\n------------------\n\n* Implemented support for text based cookies compatible with curl and wget that can be retrieved from addons from the browser.\n\n\n4.1.1 (22-04-2020)\n------------------\n\n* Updated endpoint to rpc from preview and updated dependencies.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 (01-01-2021)\n------------------\n\n* Changed to authuser setting \"2\" and loosened up pinning of dependencies.\n\n\n4.1.4 (01-01-2021)\n------------------\n\n* Releasing with changes.\n\n\n4.1.5 (01-01-2021)\n------------------\n\n* Aligning New Year's morning blunder release with git tag",
