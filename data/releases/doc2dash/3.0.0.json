    "description": "# doc2dash\n\n*doc2dash* is an extensible [Documentation Set](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/Documentation_Sets/010-Overview_of_Documentation_Sets/docset_overview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005266-CH13-SW6) (*docset*) generator that helps you to have documentation for all your favorite APIs in [*Dash.app*-compatible](https://kapeli.com/dash/) API browsers.\n\nAn API browser is an application that runs locally on your computer and allows you to search various API docs by pressing a key combination and starting to type (I have bound it to Alt-Space bar and can't write code without it).\n\nThe most common ones – [*Dash.app*](https://kapeli.com/dash) (macOS) and [*Zeal*](https://zealdocs.org) (Windows and Linux) – come with **many** docsets out of the box, but they can never offer you docsets for *every* package you'll ever use.\nThis is where *doc2dash* comes in:\nIt takes your offline documentation and converts it into an indexed format that API browsers can read and search (very fast!).\n\nCurrently it supports all known *intersphinx*-based documentation systems like [*Sphinx*](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [*pydoctor*](https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor), or [*MkDocs*](https://www.mkdocs.org) (with [*mkdocstrings*](https://mkdocstrings.github.io)).\nWhile *doc2dash* is a Python project, the support is **not** limited to Python-related formats.\n\nIt's also extendable: [**you** can write your own parser](https://doc2dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/)!\n\n![doc2dash Session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hynek/doc2dash/main/docs/doc2dash-session.png)\n\n\n## Project Information\n\n- **License**: [MIT](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/LICENSE)\n- **PyPI**: <https://pypi.org/project/doc2dash/>\n- **Source Code**: <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash>\n- **Documentation**: <https://doc2dash.rtfd.io/>\n- **Changelog**: <https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>\n- **Supported Python Versions**: 3.8 and later (check the changelog for past releases that support _much_ older Python versions)\n- **Platforms**: pre-compiled **binaries** for **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** available; also runs on everything that runs Python\n\n\n## Release Information for [3.0.0](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/compare/2.4.1...3.0.0) - 2022-09-13\n\n### Removed\n\n- Since *pydoctor* added support for *intersphinx* in version 21.2.0, the dedicated HTML-parsing parser has been removed. If you need to parse legacy *pydoctor* docs, please use *doc2dash* 2.4.1.\n\n\n### Added\n\n- Stand-alone binaries! If your platform is supported, you can now download binaries from the release page without dealing with Python at all – courtesy of [*PyOxidizer*](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/).\n- *intersphinx*: documentation based on [*MkDocs*](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [*mkdocstrings*](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) metadata is now supported.\n- *intersphinx*: if no explicit name is passed, the docset name is derived von the documentation's metadata (and not the directory name, which is more often than not just `html`).\n- We use [*rich*](https://rich.readthedocs.io/) for output and progress bars now. This allows us more granular progress indication.\n- Documentation on writing your own parser plugins.\n\n\n### Changed\n\n- Tons of refactorings that probably broke your custom parsers. Sorry about that and let us know, if we can help you fixing them.\n- *intersphinx*: We now parse `objects.inv` files on our own. *Sphinx* is not a dependency anymore.\n- *intersphinx*: Files that are indexed by *intersphinx*, but don't exist aren't added to the docset anymore. Common example is `py-modindex.html`. [#113](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/113) [#115](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/issues/115)\n- We now check if the index page passed via `--index-page` / `-I` exists and fail if it doesn't.\n\n\n\n## Credits\n\n*doc2dash* is written and maintained by Hynek Schlawack and released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\nThe development is kindly supported by my employer [Variomedia AG](https://www.variomedia.de/) and all my amazing [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\n\nA full list of contributors can be found on [GitHub's overview](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash/graphs/contributors).\n",
