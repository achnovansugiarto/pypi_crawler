This is done by using a logging adapter\ntogether with a dlt stream parser.\n\n\n# DLT protocol\nDLT (Diagnostic Log and Trace) is a proprietary logging protocol.\nIt is used in debugging automotive ECUs that run Autosar OS.\n\nYou should NOT use it if you have the choice!\n\nIt has many traps, inconsistencies and architecture dependencies.\nIn the field it does overflow its own stream buffer, corrupting data on the wire.\nIt causes endianess problems, e.g. use big endian even if it announced little endian\na few bytes before (\n[Proof 1](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/blob/master/src/shared/dlt_common.c#L1034),\n[2](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/blob/master/src/shared/dlt_common.c#L846)\n) etc.\n\nIt is clear that it did not compete against any other logging mechanism or had any trial phase.\nIt was just forged into a standard that is enforced for the Autosar OS.\n\n\n# License\nThis software is distributed under GPLv3 with some extension because GPLv3 did not manage to deny\ncriminal misuse by organizations.\nThis software is intended for usage by community and private individuals who are interested in car hacking.\nIt is explicitly denied that any company or organization monetizes on this software. Monetize does not only mean money,\nit means gaining a competitive advantage of any kind by using this software.\nThe author explicitly denies the usage for people associated with military,\ngovernment agencies of any kind to whatever degree, same for car manufacturers and associates.\n",
