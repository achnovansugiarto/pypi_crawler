    "description": "##############################################################################################\nDjango Facebook by Thierry Schellenbach (`mellowmorning.com <http://www.mellowmorning.com/>`_)\n##############################################################################################\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/tschellenbach/Django-facebook.png?branch=master\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/django-facebook/badge.png\n        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-facebook\n\nContributions are strongly appreciated. Seriously, give github a try, fork and get started :)\n\nNews\n----\n* 5.3.0 will be released early December, getting started with Django Facebook will be a lot easier now.\n\n\nDemo & About\n------------\n\nDjango Facebook enables your users to easily register using the Facebook API.\nIt converts the Facebook user data and creates regular User and Profile objects.\nThis makes it easy to integrate with your existing Django application.\n\nI've built it for my startup Fashiolista.com and it's currently used in production with thousands of signups per day.\nFor a demo of the signup flow have a look at Fashiolista's landing page (`fashiolista.com <http://www.fashiolista.com/intro_wide_minimal/>`_)\n\nAfter registration Django Facebook gives you access to user's graph. Allowing for applications such as:\n\n* Open graph/ Timeline functionality\n* Seamless personalization\n* Inviting friends\n* Finding friends\n* Posting to a users profile\n\nUpdates and tutorials can be found on my blog `mellowmorning <http://www.mellowmorning.com/>`_\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Access the Facebook API, from:\n   * Your website (Using javascript OAuth)\n   * Facebook canvas pages (For building facebook applications)\n   * Mobile (Or any other flow giving you a valid access token)\n* Django User Registration (Convert Facebook user data into a user model)\n* Store likes, friends and user data locally.\n* Facebook FQL access\n* OAuth 2.0 compliant\n* Automated reauthentication (For expired tokens)\n* Includes Open Facebook (stable and tested Python client to the graph API)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Basics**\n\n* `Installation <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_\n* `Customizing <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customizing.html>`_\n* `Settings <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html>`_\n* `Registration backends & Redirects <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/registration_backend.html>`_\n\n**Open Facebook API**\n\n* `Getting an OpenFacebook object <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/graph.html>`_\n* `Making calls <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/open_facebook/api.html>`_\n\n**Advanced**\n\n* `Mobile <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mobile.html>`_\n* `Celery <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/celery.html>`_\n* `Signals <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/signals.html>`_\n* `Canvas <http://django-facebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/canvas.html>`_\n\n\nContributing and Running tests\n------------------------------\nTests are run from within the example project. You\ncan run them yourself as follows:\n\ninstall from git\n\nfacebook_example/manage.py test django_facebook\n\n\n**Vagrant**\n\nA vagrant development setup is included in the GIT repo.\nAssuming you have vagrant installed, simply type the following in your shell:\n\n::\n\n    # First get a fresh Django-Facebook checkout\n    git clone git@github.com:tschellenbach/Django-facebook.git django-facebook\n\n    # Go to the directory:\n    cd django-facebook\n\n    # Time to start Vagrant (grab a cup of coffee after this command, it'll take a while) :)\n    vagrant up; vagrant provision\n\n    # Finally done?\n    vagrant ssh\n    python manage.py runserver 0:8000\n\nTo have a working Django Facebook example up and running at 192.168.50.42:8000/facebook/example/.\nFor the facebook login to work simply map that ip to vagrant.mellowmorning.com\n(Since Facebook checks the domain)\n\nYou can run the test suite by typing:\n\n::\n\n  python manage.py test django_facebook\n\n\n\nDjango Jobs\n-----------\nDo you also see the beauty in clean code? Are you experienced with high scalability web apps?\nCurrently we're looking for additional talent over at our Amsterdam office.\nFeel free to drop me a line at my personal email for more information: thierryschellenbach[at]gmail.com",
