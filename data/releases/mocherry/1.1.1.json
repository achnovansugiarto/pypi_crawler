    "description": "\n# MoCherry\nMoCherry is built around CherryPy & mongoengine to support REST webserivces with very low memory footprint, support for MongoDB ORM, built-in production ready WSGI server and faster initilization.\n\n# Features\n  - In-built REST webservice support\n  - MongoDB ORM support with MongoEngine plugin\n  - Similar usability & file system structure like Django to reduce the learning curve\n  - Low memory footprint\n  - In-built CherryPy WSGI server\n  - Built-in basic encryption support\n  - MIT licensed\n\n# Installation\nMoCherry is already a part of python PyPi repository. So the following command will download and install MoCherry from PyPi repository and all it's required dependencies to your system or virtualenv.\n```sh\n$ pip install mocherry\n```\n\n# Create Your First Project\nNow MoCherry consists of a cli script which will enable developers to create a sample project / app from command-line without manually download it from github. Steps as follows:\n### Create project skeleton\n```sh\n$ mocherry-cli startproject \"my_project_001\"\nDownloading sample project: https://github.com/techunits/mocherry/blob/master/mocherry/resources/samples/project.zip?raw=true\nCreating new project: my_project_001\n$ cd my_project_001\n$ python manage.py runserver  # start WSGI server\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Listening for SIGTERM.\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Bus STARTING\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Set handler for console events.       \n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Started monitor thread 'Autoreloader'.\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:21] ENGINE Serving on http://localhost:9090\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:21] ENGINE Bus STARTED\n```\n\n### Create application skeleton\nLets assume you have already created a project by following above steps, then you have to go inside that project and create app skeleton as per your requirements.\n```sh\n# Application name: app_001\n$ mocherry-cli startapp \"app_001\"\nDownloading sample app: https://github.com/techunits/mocherry/blob/master/mocherry/resources/samples/app.zip?raw=true\nCreating new app: app_001\n\n# Application name: app_002\n$ mocherry-cli startapp \"app_002\"\nDownloading sample app: https://github.com/techunits/mocherry/blob/master/mocherry/resources/samples/app.zip?raw=true\nCreating new app: app_002\n\n$ python manage.py runserver  # start WSGI server\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Listening for SIGTERM.\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Bus STARTING\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Set handler for console events.       \n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:20] ENGINE Started monitor thread 'Autoreloader'.\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:21] ENGINE Serving on http://localhost:9090\n[20/Jan/2020:00:52:21] ENGINE Bus STARTED\n```\n\n\n# MoCherry Management Commands\nMoCherry framework also support custom management commands to enhance its CLI capabilities. With the framework sample code we have provided a test command to verify how it works\n\n```sh\n$ python manage.py testcmd\nSuccess: This is a test command\n```\n\n# MoCherry Sample Dataset\nMoCherry provides sample data from the version 1.0.9 onwards. This should help developers to play around with the framework immediately without writing any code. You can create sample data by using following management command.\n\n```sh\n$ python manage.py load_sample_data\nDatabase: mongodb://localhost:27017/mocherry_sample_app\n\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e60\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e61\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e62\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e63\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e64\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e65\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e66\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e67\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e68\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e69\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e6a\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e6b\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e6c\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e6d\nNew Sample Data: 5e9abd4ab22cfec440086e6e\n```\n\n\n# Sample Applications\n - https://github.com/techunits/mocherry-sample-app\n - https://github.com/techunits/mocherry-sample-rest-app\n\n\n",
