    "description": "# django-flexible-manifest-staticfiles\n\nThis extension to `django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage` allows you to specify a list of file patterns that should be ignored/excluded from being versioned and added to the manifest. You can also specify it the other way around and say which files should be included.\n\nThis allows you to add versioned naming to only static files of your choosing. For example, you may want CSS and JS files to be versioned, but not fonts, images or other assets.\n\nI've written and tested this against Django 2.2. Your mileage elsewhere may vary!\n\n## Installation\n\nUse pip:\n\n```shell\npip install django-flexible-manifest-staticfiles\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nSet in your `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nSTATICFILES_STORAGE = 'django_flexible_manifest_staticfiles.storages.ForgivingManifestStaticFilesStorage'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSet in your `settings.py` you can set two settings:\n\n - `STATICFILES_VERSIONED_INCLUDE` - This is a list of patterns you want to be included. Only files that match at least one of these patterns will be included. If you omit this setting, then all files are included by default.\n - `STATICFILES_VERSIONED_EXCLUDE` - Any file matching any of these patterns will be excluded from being versioned.\n\nFiles must match against both rules (e.g. they must be both in the include list and not in the exclude list) in order to be versioned.\n\nNote that the complete path relative to the `static` directory is available for matching against.\n\n## Examples\n\nThis would only version `.css` and `.js` files, but would exclude minified files:\n\n```python\nSTATICFILES_VERSIONED_INCLUDE = ['.css$', '.js$']\nSTATICFILES_VERSIONED_EXCLUDE = ['min.css$', 'min.js$']\n```\n\nThis would version all files asides from `.jpg` files:\n\n```python\nSTATICFILES_VERSIONED_EXCLUDE = ['.jpg$']\n```\n\nThis would only version things in your `/static/scripts`:\n\n```python\nSTATICFILES_VERSIONED_INCLUDE = ['scripts/.*$']\n```",
