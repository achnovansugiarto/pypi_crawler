    "description": "==================\ndjango-staticfiles\n==================\n\nThis is a Django app that provides helpers for serving static files.\n\nDjango developers mostly concern themselves with the dynamic parts of web\napplications -- the views and templates that render new for each request. But\nweb applications have other parts: the static media files (images, CSS,\nJavascript, etc.) that are needed to render a complete web page.\n\nFor small projects, this isn't a big deal, because you can just keep the media\nsomewhere your web server can find it. However, in bigger projects -- especially\nthose comprised of multiple apps -- dealing with the multiple sets of static\nfiles provided by each application starts to get tricky.\n\nThat's what ``staticfiles`` is for: it collects static files from each of your\napplications (and any other places you specify) into a single location\nthat can easily be served in production.\n\nThe main website for django-staticfiles is\n`github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles`_ where you can also file tickets.\n\n.. warning:: django-staticfiles was added to Django 1.3 as a contrib app.\n\n   The django-staticfiles 0.3.X series will only receive security and data los\n   bug fixes after the release of django-staticfiles 1.0. Any Django 1.2.X\n   project using django-staticfiles 0.3.X and lower should be upgraded to use\n   either Django's staticfiles app or django-staticfiles>=1.0 to profit from\n   the feature parity.\n\n   Since any new feature (including those backported from Django's staticfiles\n   app) will be added in releases >= 1.0.X of this app, you may want to chose\n   to use it instead of Django's own staticfiles app.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n- Use your favorite Python packaging tool to install ``staticfiles``\n  from `PyPI`_, e.g.::\n\n    pip install django-staticfiles\n\n  You can also install the `in-development version`_ of django-staticfiles\n  with ``pip install django-staticfiles==dev``.\n\n- Added ``\"staticfiles\"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        # ...\n        \"staticfiles\",\n    ]\n\n- Set your ``STATIC_URL`` setting to the URL that handles serving\n  static files::\n\n    STATIC_URL = \"/static/\"\n\n- In development mode (when ``DEBUG = True``) the ``runserver`` command will\n  automatically serve static files::\n\n    python manage.py runserver\n\n- Once you are ready to deploy all static files of your site in a central\n  directory (``STATIC_ROOT``) to be served by a real webserver (e.g. Apache_,\n  Cherokee_, Lighttpd_, Nginx_ etc.), use the ``collectstatic`` management\n  command::\n\n    python manage.py collectstatic\n\n  See the webserver's documentation for descriptions how to setup serving\n  the deployment directory (``STATIC_ROOT``).\n\n.. _github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles: http://github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles\n.. _in-development version: http://github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles/tarball/develop#egg=django-staticfiles-dev\n.. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles\n.. _Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/\n.. _Lighttpd: http://www.lighttpd.net/\n.. _Nginx: http://wiki.nginx.org/\n.. _Cherokee: http://www.cherokee-project.com/",
