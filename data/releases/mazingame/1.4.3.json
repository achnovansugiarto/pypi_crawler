If you ask why?\nBecause it makes distribution simple and life easier :-).\n\nIf using sources, Python 3.x with curses and\n`mazepy <https://github.com/samisalkosuo/mazepy>`__. Does not work with\nPython2 or Windows without Cygwin.\n\nInstall and usage - Docker\n--------------------------\n\nInstall from Dockerhub:\n\n-  docker pull kazhar/mazingame\n\nUse\n\nInstall and usage - pip\n-----------------------\n\nThere is a version in pip. Install from pip:\n\n-  **pip install mazingame**.\n\nNote that this is not regularly updated\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nYou will start at some location in the bottom of the maze. ‘X’ is\nsomewhere nearer the top of the maze. Move using cursor keys or\n‘w’,‘a’,‘s’,‘d’. Quit pressing ‘q’ or Ctrl-C.\n\nWhen, or if, you reach ‘X’, the ending score is saved to SQLite\ndatabase. The default highscore file location is\n$HOME/.mazingame_highscores.sqlite. Use environment variable\nMAZINGAME_HIGHSCORE_FILE to set another file.\n\nCommand line options include: -f, –fullscreen Use terminal to show\nentire maze. But only if terminal size is larger than the maze.\n–showpath Show shortest path. Remember: this is cheating. –showmaze Show\nentire maze. Remember: this is cheating. -hs, –highscores Show high\nscores.\n\nAnd a few more.\n\nNote: database in high score file may change from version to version, if\nyou get SQLite error when saving high scores, delete your high score\nfile.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis hobby project was inspired by the book “Mazes for Programmers” by\nJamis Buck (https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers).\n\nPython translations of the maze code is in mazepy-project\n(https://github.com/samisalkosuo/mazepy).\n\nSee http://sami.salkosuo.net/mazingame/ for some background about\nMazinGame.",
