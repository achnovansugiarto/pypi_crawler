    "description": "MazinGame\n=========\nA game of maze.\n\nIdea of the game is to find a path through the maze to a location marked by 'X'.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPython 3.5 with curses. Developed and tested with Cygwin and Mac OS X. \nDoes not work with Python2 or Windows without Cygwin.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nInstall latest version: **pip install mazingame**.\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nYou will start at some location in the bottom of the maze. 'X' is somewhere\nnearer the top of the maze.\nMove using cursor keys or 'w','a','s','d'.\nQuit pressing 'q' or Ctrl-C.\n\nWhen, or if, you reach 'X', the ending score is saved to SQLite database.\nThe default highscore file location is $HOME/.mazingame_highscores.sqlite.\nUse environment variable MAZINGAME_HIGHSCORE_FILE to set another file.\n\nCommand line options include:\n\t-f, --fullscreen      Use terminal to show entire maze. But only if terminal size is larger than the maze.\n\t--showpath            Show shortest path. Remember: this is cheating.\n\t--showmaze            Show entire maze. Remember: this is cheating.\n\t-hs, --highscores     Show high scores.\n\nAnd a few more.\n\nNote: database in high score file may change from version to version, if you\nget SQLite error when saving high scores, delete your high score file.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis hobby project was inspired by the book \"Mazes for Programmers\" by Jamis Buck\n(https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers).\n\nPython translations of the maze code is in mazepy-project (https://github.com/samisalkosuo/mazepy).\n\nSee http://sami.salkosuo.net/mazingame/ for some background about MazinGame.",
