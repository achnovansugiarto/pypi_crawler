Add `track_actions` to your INSTALLED_APPS setting\n\n        INSTALLED_APPS = [\n            ...,\n            'track_actions',\n        ]\n\n\n2. Add `track_actions.requestMiddleware.RequestMiddleware` in settings under middlewares\n\n        MIDDLEWARE = [\n            ... ,\n            'track_actions.requestMiddleware.RequestMiddleware',\n        ]\n\n\n3. Run `python manage.py migrate track_actions` to create the History model.\n\n        `python manage.py migrate track_actions`\n\n\nAfter this every POST, UPDATE and DELETE action will be recorded in your database under the history model.\n\n**To prevent sensitive fields from being saved**\n\nFor example `passwords`.\n\nYou will have to create a yaml file called `drf_history.yaml` on the root of your django project.\nIn this file add the following. \n\n`fields_to_exclude: [\"password\",\"another key here\"]`\n\nYou can then add all sensitve fields in the list separated by commas. These fields will be removed from the saved request data. This will apply to all tables.\n\nThis is only for data sent in the request. \n\n\n**To get the current request**\n\nTo get the current request in progress anywhere in the application.\n\n1. Import the relevant class.\n\n        from track_actions.requestMiddleware import RequestMiddleware\n\n\n2   Get the current request object.\n\n        current_request = RequestMiddleware.get_request_data()[1]\n\n\n**To access the get history endpoint**\n\n1. In your project's url file\n\n\n        `import track_actions` \n\n2. Register the url in the urlpattern \n\n        `path('track_actions/', include('track_actions.urls'))`\n\n3. visit the url in the browser or on postman\n\n        `http://127.0.0.1:8000/track_actions/history/`\n\nyou should be able to see all the recorded history if you have `admin` priveleges and you are authenticated.\n\n\n**Alternatively**\n\nYou can create your own endpoint to view all history from the History model by importing it in your views or serializers.\n\n        `from track_actions.models import History`\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThis package will only work if you have a user in a request and a user model in your database.\n\n\n",
