There's an even gentler introduction taking the form of a [colab notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_die/first_submission.ipynb) you can open and run now. \n\n# [Me](https://github.com/microprediction/home), my [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/microprediction/shared_invite/zt-17dk5h0g6-ikKvI3p3wdav_CYmxozJvw) and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercotton/)\nThis was supposed to be the microprediction [client](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/microprediction) page! Github made this a \"user page\". Grumble. Well, hi this is my [dog](https://i.imgur.com/2E3pskp.jpg). This is my [blog](https://www.microprediction.com/blog). I've always worked in the private sector, though very occasionally [publish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V5wB8lEAAAAJ&hl=en). My [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/microprediction) is out soon. I'm dynamic and fascinating. Not really but I run a slack channel for those interested in collective open-source time-series, covariance prediction, and optimization (here's the [slack invite](https://join.slack.com/t/microprediction/shared_invite/zt-15mald9ph-oalX5h0wbKXRMdokGoPKZA)). Join the google meet Fri noon EST - see the slack. If the Slack invite requires an email domain, it has expired so DM [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercotton/) on Linked-In for a new one. \n\n# The [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines), [Precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise), and [HumpDay](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday) packages \n\nI maintain three benchmarking packages to help me, and maybe you, surf the open-source wave. \n\n| Topic                  | Package           | Elo ratings | Methods | Data sources | \n|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|--------------| \n| Univariate time-series | [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines)  | [Timeseries Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/univariate-k_003.html) | Most popular packages ([list](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skaters)) | [microprediction streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) |\n| Global derivative-free optimization | [humpday](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday) |  [Optimizer Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/optimizer-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/overall.html) | Most popular packages ([list](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/tree/main/humpday/optimizers)) | A mix of classic and new [objectives](https://github.com/microprediction/humpday/tree/main/humpday/objectives)      |\n| Covariance, precision, correlation | [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise) | See [notebooks](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/tree/main/examples_colab_notebooks) | See [notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/examples_colab_notebooks/list_all_cov_methods.ipynb) |Stocks, timeseries residuals etc | \n\nThese packages aspire to advance online autonomous prediction in a small way, but also help me notice if anyone else does!  \n\n# The [microprediction.org](https://www.microprediction.org/) [streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) ($50,000 in prediction [prizes](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions/daily))\nI also maintain a *live exchange* where distributional time-series prediction algorithms (Python, R, Julia mostly) duke it out.  \n\n- I publish live data repeatedly, [like this](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/stream_examples_traffic/traffic_speed.py) say, and it\n creates a stream (like [this stream](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=c2_rebalanced_30_mean) or [this one](https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=electricity-load-nyiso-overall) or any from the [listing](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html)). \n- Algorithms like [this guy](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples/soshed_boa.py) compete to make distributional predictions 1 min ahead, 5 min ahead, 15 min ahead and 1 hr ahead. \n\nIn this way I can:\n - Get live prediction of public data for free (sometimes I make the \"public\" data obscure)\n - Indirectly benefit from [hundreds of packages](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/popular-timeseries-packages) from Github of uncertain quality, and not just Python.   \n\nI then sip pina coladas while the accuracy magically improves over time. Read about [this example](https://medium.com/geekculture/an-empirical-article-that-wasnt-immediately-stale-720abfb4678f). \n  \n### Wanna use it? \nKnock yourself out. My company funds the platform because algorithms that help solve your problem might also help solve mine. The marginal cost of their doing so is tiny. There are even [video instructions](https://www.microprediction.com/python-4).  \n\n### Wanna make it better?\n\nOn the flip side you can:\n  - Contribute predictive intelligence, win beer money (see [competitions](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions)) and then trash talk people in our slack channel. About $50,000 a year in prizes complements the scientific motivations. \n  - Automatically benchmark your work or find unexpected [uses](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) to include in your next paper. You just need to know [how to predict data streams](https://www.microprediction.com/make-predictions), which amounts to modifying a Python script and running it. \n  \nIt's up to you if you choose to reveal your code. \n\n# [Microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/microprediction) Python client\n\n\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install microprediction\n\nThe [client](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) assists use of the [microprediction api](http://api.microprediction.org/). If you don't know about the live algorithm frenzy at [microprediction.org](https://www.microprediction.org/) making this possible because you skipped down this page, did I mention that an extremely simple way to grok it is to open this colab [notebook](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_die/first_submission.ipynb) and run it on Google's dime? Why yes I did mention that. This will create an identity for you and enter your algorithm in an ongoing contest to predict the next roll of a die. You'll also be exactly half way to understanding the four critical pieces of functionality.  \n\n|   | Task                                      | Method or function                | Full code example                                                                                                                                   | Video tutorial                                                                    |\n|---|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A | Create a write_key                        | new_key                           | [enter_die_contest_one_off.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_die/enter_die_contest_one_off.py) | [python-1: Your first submission](https://www.microprediction.com/python-1)       |\n| B | Publish one scalar value at a time, usually representing a live measurement.   | MicroWriter.set()                 | [creating_a_stream.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microtutorial/blob/master/examples/creating_a_stream.py)                                  | [python-4: Creating a stream](https://www.microprediction.com/python-4)           |\n| C | Send 225 guesses of the next value of a stream, after a fixed quarantine period. | MicroWriter.submit()              | [enter_die_contest_one_off.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_die/enter_die_contest_one_off.py) | [python-2: Creating your first crawler](https://www.microprediction.com/python-2) |\n| D | Retrieve community predictions (PDF) 1min, 5min, 15min or 1hr ahead.            | MicroWriter.get_own_predictions() | [defassa_dog.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_golf/defassa_dog.py)                            |  [colab example](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/notebook_examples/get_and_show_submitted_predictions.ipynb)                                                                                 |                  |                                                                                   |   |\n\nSomeone wanting something predicted performs A, B and D. Someone providing predictions performs A and C (mindful of the reward mechanism explained in [Collective Distributional Prediction](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/intro)).   \n\n\n# [Memorable Unique Identifiers](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) and other platform repos\n\n- The [muid](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) identifier package is explained in this [video](https://vimeo.com/397352413). \n- [microconventions](https://github.com/microprediction/microconventions) captures things common to client and server, and may answer many of your more specific questions about prediction horizons, et cetera.  \n- [rediz](https://github.com/microprediction/rediz) contains server side code. For the brave. \n- There are other rats and mice like [getjson](https://github.com/microprediction/getjson), [runthis](https://github.com/microprediction/runthis) and [momentum](https://github.com/microprediction/momentum).  \n\n# Some of my other packages: \n\n- [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning) - A recently published fast algorithm for inferring relative ability from win probability. \n- [embarrassingly](https://github.com/microprediction/embarrassingly) - A speculative approach to robust optimization that sends impure objective functions to optimizers.\n- [pandemic](https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic) - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck epidemic simulation (related [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10311))\n\nFor (American) football fans\n- [firstdown](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown) - The repo that aspires to ruin the great game of football. See Wilmott [paper](https://github.com/microprediction/firstdown/blob/main/wilmott_paper/44-49_Cotton_PDF5_Jan22%20(2).pdf).  \n\nFor M6 competitors:\n- [m6](https://github.com/microprediction/m6) - Illustrates fast numerical rank probability calculations, using [winning](https://github.com/microprediction/winning). However since the rules changed, this isn't that useful for M6 anymore. There are some other resources there although you might be better served by [precise](https://github.com/microprediction/precise). Good luck. \n\n# Microprediction versus TimeMachines\n\nThe [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) package is traditional open-source software for *point-estimates* and confidence, whereas the [Microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) client offers live crowd based *distributional* prediction. Hundreds of algorithms compete at [Microprediction](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction) and quite a few of the [TimeMachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines) algorithms (see [/skaters](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skaters)) are involved, drawn from packages like [river](https://github.com/online-ml/river), [pydlm](https://github.com/wwrechard/pydlm), [tbats](https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats), [pmdarima](http://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/), [statsmodels.tsa](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html), [neuralprophet](https://neuralprophet.com/), Facebook [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), \n   Uber's [orbit](https://eng.uber.com/orbit/), Facebook's [greykite](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/greykite--a-flexible--intuitive--and-fast-forecasting-library) and more. Some are open source (look for CODE badges on [leaderboards](https://www.microprediction.org/leaderboard.html)) but others are private to their author.  \n \n### StreamSkaters\n \nOne bridge between the [/skaters](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skaters) and the microprediction [leaderboards](https://www.microprediction.org/leaderboard.html) is provided by the StreamSkater class in the microprediction package, illustrated in the [StreamSkater examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_skater_examples) folder. This makes it trivial to use any skater from the TimeMachines package in a MicroCrawler (a live algorithm). \n\n## More about the Microprediction Python Client\nSee also [README_EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/README_EXAMPLES.md) or \n[README_LONGER.md](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/README_LONGER.md)\n\n### Class Hierarchy \n\nUse [MicroReader](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/reader.py) if you just need to get data and don't care to use a key..     \n\n    MicroReader\n       |\n    MicroWriter ----------------------------\n       |                                   |\n    MicroPoll                         MicroCrawler\n    (feed creator)               (self-navigating algorithm)\n             \nYou can pull most data [directly](https://www.microprediction.com/public-api), by the way, without a key. \n             \n### Scheduled submissions versus \"crawling\"\nThe [MicroWriter](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/writer.py) class can publish data or submit predictions. However if you intend to run a continuous process you might consider the [MicroCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/crawler.py) class or its derivatives. \n\n| Type                               | Suggestion                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                     | More examples                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scheduled submission               | [MicroWriter](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/writer.py)        | [Ambassy Fox](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/submission_examples_transition/ambassy_fox.py) | [submission_examples_transition](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/submission_examples_transition) |\n| Running process                    | [MicroCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/crawler.py)      | [Malaxable Fox](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples/malaxable_fox.py)           | [crawler_examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_examples)                             |\n| Running process using timemachines | [StreamSkater](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/streamskater.py) | [Shole Gazelle](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_examples/shole_gazelle.py)           | [crawler_skater_examples](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_skater_examples)               |\n\nA more complete picture would include [SimpleCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/simplecrawler.py), \n[RegularCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/simplecrawler.py), \n[OnlineHorizonCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/onlinecrawler.py), \n[OnlineStreamCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/onlinecrawler.py) and\n[ReportingCrawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/reportingcrawler.py).\n\n\n### Publishing absolute quantities versus changes\nIt is often better to publish *changes* in values than actual values of live quantities, to avoid race conditions or latency issues. There is a discussion in the [README_LONGER.md](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/README_LONGER.md). \n\nCertainly it is easy to publish live quantities using only the [MicroWriter](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/writer.py) as shown in [traffic_live.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/feed_examples_live/traffic_live.py). However you might consider:\n\n- [ChangePoll](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/polling.py) for publishing only when values change, \n- [MultiPoll](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/polling.py) for multiple streams\n- [MultiChangePoll](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/microprediction/polling.py). \n\n### [Microprediction.Com](https://www.microprediction.com/) versus [Microprediction.org](https://www.microprediction.org/)\n\nThe former contains the [blog](https://www.microprediction.com/blog), a [knowledge center](https://www.microprediction.com/knowledge-center) with video tutorials, details of [competitions](https://www.microprediction.com/competitions) and prizemoney, and so forth. The latter is browser for humans looking to see how their algorithms are are performing, or whether their streams are updating.     \n\n### Slack & Google Meets Tue 8pm/ Fri noon EST\n\nMost people looking to contribute to this open initiative (and win beer money) join the [microprediction slack](https://join.slack.com/t/microprediction/shared_invite/zt-10ad1yiec-Jgsjkit~~dwNnpvRzyBTaQ). If that invite fails there might be one in the [knowledge center](https://www.microprediction.com/knowledge-center) that hasn't expired.
