Install Fortran compiler, if you don't already have it\n   * MacOS / Linux:\n    `brew install gcc`\n   * Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux:\n     `sudo apt-get install gfortran`\n   * Windows (experimental):\n     * `conda install -c conda-forge m2w64-toolchain_win-64`, or\n     * [Install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) and `pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`\n\n2. `pip install -U mknapsack`\n\n\n## Example usage\n\n### Single 0-1 Knapsack Problem\n\n```python\nfrom mknapsack import solve_single_knapsack\n\n# Given ten items with the following profits and weights:\nprofits = [78, 35, 89, 36, 94, 75, 74, 79, 80, 16]\nweights = [18, 9, 23, 20, 59, 61, 70, 75, 76, 30]\n\n# ...and a knapsack with the following capacity:\ncapacity = 190\n\n# Assign items into the knapsack while maximizing profits\nres = solve_single_knapsack(profits, weights, capacity)\n```\n\nIf your inputs are real numbers, you may set parameter `method='mt1r'`.\n\n### Bounded Knapsack Problem\n\n```python\nfrom mknapsack import solve_bounded_knapsack\n\n# Given ten item types with the following profits and weights:\nprofits = [78, 35, 89, 36, 94, 75, 74, 79, 80, 16]\nweights = [18, 9, 23, 20, 59, 61, 70, 75, 76, 30]\n\n# ..and the number of items for each item type:\nn_items = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n\n# ...and a knapsack with the following capacity:\ncapacity = 190\n\n# Assign items into the knapsack while maximizing profits\nres = solve_bounded_knapsack(profits, weights, capacity, n_items)\n```\n\n### Unbounded Knapsack Problem\n\n```python\nfrom mknapsack import solve_unbounded_knapsack\n\n# Given ten item types with the following profits and weights:\nprofits = [16, 72, 35, 89, 36, 94, 75, 74, 100, 80]\nweights = [30, 18, 9, 23, 20, 59, 61, 70, 75, 76]\n\n# ...and a knapsack with the following capacity:\ncapacity = 190\n\n# Assign items repeatedly into the knapsack while maximizing profits\nres = solve_unbounded_knapsack(profits, weights, capacity, n_items)\n```\n\n### Multiple 0-1 Knapsack Problem\n\n```python\nfrom mknapsack import solve_multiple_knapsack\n\n# Given ten items with the following profits and weights:\nprofits = [78, 35, 89, 36, 94, 75, 74, 79, 80, 16]\nweights = [18, 9, 23, 20, 59, 61, 70, 75, 76, 30]\n\n# ...and two knapsacks with the following capacities:\ncapacities = [90, 100]\n\n# Assign items into the knapsacks while maximizing profits\nres = solve_multiple_knapsack(profits, weights, capacities)\n```\n\n## References\n\n* [Knapsack problems: algorithms and computer implementations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/98124) by S.
