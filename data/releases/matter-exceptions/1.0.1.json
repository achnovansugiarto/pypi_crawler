This library includes three major categories of exceptions, namely API exceptions, detailed exceptions, and FastAPI exceptions, that can be tailored to specific use cases.\n\nAPI exceptions are designed to provide clear and concise error messages for clients accessing an API. With this library, developers can easily create and customize API exceptions that contain relevant error messages, HTTP status codes, and detailed descriptions of what went wrong. These API exceptions can also include payloads, which can be forwarded to error tracking systems for debugging and analysis purposes.\n\nDetailed exceptions, on the other hand, are designed for internal use by developers. These exceptions can be used to catch specific errors and provide detailed information about what went wrong. Developers can easily create and customize detailed exceptions with this library, including payloads that can be sent to error tracking systems to aid in debugging.\n\nFastAPI exceptions are designed specifically for use with the FastAPI framework. With this library, developers can create and customize FastAPI exceptions that are easy to use and integrate seamlessly with FastAPI applications. These exceptions can also contain payloads, which can be forwarded to error tracking systems for analysis and debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, the matter-exceptions library in Python is a powerful tool that allows developers to create and customize exceptions that provide clear, concise, and detailed error messages. With the ability to include payloads, these exceptions can be used to aid in debugging and error tracking, ensuring that developers can quickly and effectively resolve any issues that arise in their applications.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nBasic:\n```console\npip install matter-exceptions\n```\n\nWith FastAPI Support:\n```console\npip install matter-exceptions[fastapi]\n```\n\n\n## Getting Started\nRaise an API Exception:\n```python\nfrom matter_exceptions.exceptions.api import ConflictError\nraise ConflictError(description=\"test\", detail=\"any payloads, including dicts or objects\")\n```\n\nRaise a Fast API Exception:\n```python\nfrom matter_exceptions.exceptions.fastapi import NotFoundError\nraise NotFoundError(description=\"test\")\n```\n\nRaise a Detailed Exception:\n```python\nfrom matter_exceptions.exceptions.general import AuthenticationFailedError\nraise AuthenticationFailedError(description=\"test\")\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nMake sure you have all supported python versions installed in your machine:\n\n* 3.10\n* 3.11\n\n### Install hatch in your system\n\n```https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/```\n\n### Create the environment\n\n```console\nhatch env create\n```\n\nDo your changes...\n\n### Run the tests\n\n```console\nhatch run test\n```\n\nThe command above will run the tests against all supported python versions\ninstalled in your machine. For testing in other operating system you may use the\nconfigured CI in github. \n\n### Bump a new version\n\nIn general, you just need to execute:\n\n```console\nhatch version\n```\n\nThis command will update the minor version. i.e.:\nNo breaking changes and new feature has been added\n\nWe are using [semantic version](https://semver.org/), if you are doing a bug fix:\n\n```console\nhatch version fix\n```\n",
