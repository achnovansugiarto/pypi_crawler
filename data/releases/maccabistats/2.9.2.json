    "description": "# Description \n\nSimple package which allow to figure out more about maccabi tel-aviv football team while manipulating statistics.\nAtm all the data parsed from maccabi-tlv site.\n\n\n# TL;DR\nYou can get the serialized maccabi games from [mega](https://mega.nz/#F!iX4y1CrJ!sCRXAGcImG8nK4jk8hUMEA)\n(separate by maccabistats version).\nafter that you can just load the games:\n\n```\nfrom maccabistats import get_maccabi_stats\ngames = get_maccabi_stats(your_maccabi.games_file_path)  # Use the local path you've downloaded the file from mega.\n```\n\nYou might want to use:\n```\ngames = games.league_games\n```\nbecause there are not only league games.\n\nnow, enjoy :)\n\n# Manipulating maccabi statistics\n\n### Loading games\n\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import get_maccabi_stats\n>>> games = get_maccabi_stats()  # From default folder path (Home folder - %userprofile%)\n>>> games = get_maccabi_stats(r\"C:\\maccabi\\maccabi.games\")  # From local custom file path\n```\nEach list of games is from the same type - MaccabiGamesStats.  \nAll the below manipulating can be done on every sub-category of games, like:  \nold_games, old_home_games and old_home_wins.  \n\nGetting only old home wins can be done in this way:\n\n```\n>>> old_games = games.played_before(\"1.1.2000\")\n>>> old_home_games = old_games.home_games\n>>> old_home_wins = old_home_games.maccabi_wins\n>>>\n>>> or just:\n>>> games.played_before(\"1.1.2000\").home_games.maccabi_wins\n```\n\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```\n>>> games.averages.goals_for_maccabi  # Avg goals for maccabi, for all the games in the list.\n>>> games.results.wins_percentage  #  the win % from the games in the list.\n>>>\n>>> game.get_games_* = use to filter games.\n>>> Lets combine all, wins % against hapoel haifa in league games:\n>>> game.league_games.get_games_against_team(\"הפועל חיפה\").results.wins_percentage\n```\n\n\n### Players\nAll of the names are very intuitive, some examples:\n\n```\n>>> games.players.best_scorers\n>>> games.players.get_most_winners_by_percentage()\n>>> games.players.most_played\n>>>\n>>> Getting top 5 scored players in league derby:\n>>> games.league_games.get_games_against_team(\"הפועל תל אביב\").players.best_scorers[0:5]\n```\n\n### Coaches and Referees\nYou can get the win\\lose percentages of each one just by:\n\n```\n>>> games.coaches.most_winner_coach_by_percentage\n>>> games.referees.best_referee_by_percentage[0:2]  # Top 2 referees (in all maccabi games history).\n>>>\n>>> Getting best derby coaches:\n>>> games.league_games.get_games_against_team(\"הפועל תל אביב\").coaches.most_winner_coach_by_percentage\n```\n\n\n### Comebacks\nYou can get the craziest maccabi comebacks:\n\n```\n>>> games.comebacks.won_from_exactly_two_goal_diff()\n>>> games.comebacks.won_from_exactly_x_goal_diff(goals=3)  # Wow!\n```\n\n### Streaks\nYou can get the longest (or by streak length) streaks of any subset of maccabi games:\n\n```\n>>> games.streaks.get_longest_* = use to get the longest streak by condition, like:\n>>> games.streaks.get_longest_clean_sheet_games()  #  Games in a row without goal against maccabi.\n>>>\n>>> games.streak.get_similar_* = use to get similar with len of at least X and by condition.\n>>> # All the unbeaten rows of at least len of 20:\n>>> games.streaks.get_similar_unbeaten_streak_by_length(minimum_streak_length=20)   \n```\n\n### Players Streaks\nYou can get the longest players streaks of any subset of maccabi games:\n\n```\n>>> # Use to get the players with best streak of scoring (count the game only if the player played).\n>>> games.players_streaks.get_players_with_best_goal_scoring_streak()\n>>>\n>>> # Same for unbeaten:\n>>> games.players_streaks.get_players_with_best_unbeaten_streak()\n>>>\n>>>\n>>> # Get the players with the best current unbeaten streak\n>>> games.players_streaks.get_players_with_current_unbeaten_streak()\n>>> # Or those who have the best streak of maccabi score a goal with them\n>>> games.players_streaks.get_players_with_current_maccabi_score_goal_streak()\n```\n\n### Teams Streaks\nVery similar to players streak section\n\n```\n>>> # Get the top winning streak against one team\n>>> games.teams_streaks.get_teams_with_current_win_streak()\n>>>\n>>> # Get the teams with the best unbeaten streak\n>>> games.teams_streak.get_teams_with_current_unbeaten_streak()\n```\n\n### Teams statistics\nYou can get any game related statistics that will be order all the teams from those who have the most of this condition:\n\n```\n>>> # Get the teams that maccabi won the most\n>>> games.teams.teams_ordered_by_maccabi_wins()\n>>>\n>>> # Get the teams that maccabi had the most clean sheets games in percentage \n>>> games.teams.teams_ordered_by_maccabi_clean_sheets_percentage()\n```\n\n### Seasons\nYou can get the games grouped by seasons sorted by any condition, such as:\n\n```\n>>> seasons = games.seasons.get_seasons_stats()  # At default the season will be sorted by year.\n>>> seasons.sort_by_wins_percentage()  # Sort the season by winning percentage, you should print the season object).\n>>> seasons  # Print it\n```\n\n\n# Crawling maccabi games\n\nWhen crawling maccabi games each page will be saved on your disk to allow optimization for the next time.\nTo serialize maccabi games (it might take some time), use:\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import serialize_maccabi_games\n# The object will be serialized to home folder (%userprofile%) with its version and the current date.\n>>> serialize_maccabi_games(maccabi_games_stats_object)\n```\n\nManual-fixes will be run after crawling is finished and before serializing to disk.\n\nYou can 'use_multi-process-crawl' from settings to allow multi-processing,  \nBUT atm logging does not support multi-processing, so don't use that if you need to debug.\n\n\n# Manual fixes\n\nThere are some information that need to be fix manually.  \nWhen serializing maccabi games that done automatically.\nIf you Add anything to run_general_fixes, you can re-run it by:\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import get_maccabi_stats, run_general_fixes, serialize_maccabi_games\n>>> \n>>> games = get_maccabi_stats()\n>>> new_games = run_general_fixes(games)\n>>> serialize_maccabi_games(new_games)\n```\n\n# Logging\n\nAll of the log files will be saved at 'maccabistats\\logs' folder under the user home folder (%userprofile%)\nThere are several log files, each one has this pattern - maccabistats-{suffix}.log (at the mentioned folder): \n\n* all - save all log levels\n* info - save just the info log level\n* warning - save just the warn log level\n* exception - save just exceptions (log.exception)\n* stdout - not a file but log handler that print to stdout (info level +) \n\n\n# Known issues\n\n* Ignoring events after 120 min (in game_events_parser -> fully_game_time_without_penalties)\n* Logging with multi-process crawling mode isn't working.\n\n\n# Optimization \n* You can use 'use-disk-to-crawl-when-available' to crawl from disk when available, each page that will be crawled from internet wil be save on disk. \n* For the first time, you can get some of the html files from: https://mega.nz/#F!szxTUDRQ ( key will be available at forum.12p.co.il)\n* You can reduce logging when crawling by use :\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import faster_logging\n>>> faster_logging() will disable the stdout & debug handlers.\n```\n\n\n# Errors Finder\n\nManual check for errors might be helpful, this is can be done by:\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import get_maccabi_stats\n>>> from maccabistats.error_finder.error_finder import ErrorsFinder\n>>> games = get_maccabi_stats()\n>>> e = ErrorsFinder(games)\n>>> e.get_all_errors_numbers()  # run all the manual errors exists\n```\n\n\n# MaccabiPedia Source\n\nYou can manipulate [MaccabiPedia](http:\\\\www.maccabipedia.co.il) data by downloading it and then loading it \n(You may have to install some 'advanced' packages such as pywikibot), as the following:\n\n```\n>>> from maccabistats import run_maccabipedia_source\n>>>\n>>> # You should run this once a while, this is a heavy action to do:\n>>> maccabipedia = run_maccabipedia_source()\n>>> # Now you can manipulate maccabipedia data as explain above (its MaccabiGamesStats object, referred as \"games\" above\") \n```\n\n\n\n",
