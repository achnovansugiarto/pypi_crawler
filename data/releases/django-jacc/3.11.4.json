    "description": "django-jacc\n===========\n\nSimple double entry accounting system (debits/credits) for Django projects. Django 3.0 support and unit test coverage 75%.\n\nA debit is an accounting entry that either increases an asset or expense account,\nor decreases a liability or equity account. Dividends/expenses/assets/losses increased with debit.\nDebits are recorded on left in classic T format presentation of account entries.\n\nA credit is an accounting entry that either increases a liability or equity account, or decreases an asset or expense account. \nGains/income/revenues/liabilities/equity increased with credit.\nCredits are recorded on right in classic T format presentation of account entries.\n\nIn the libary, debits are recorded as account entry objects with positive amount, and credits are recorded as objects with negative amount. \nEvery entry is associated with an account, and account objects have always account type associated with them. \nAccount type can have code, name and category (asset/liability account). Account entries also have entry types associated with them. \nEntry types can specify product code, name and entry classification (payment/settlement).\nAccount entries can have parent entry defined, which can be used to represent combined account entries.\n\nIn addition to accounts and account entries, the library has models for basic invoices.\n\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/kajala/django-jacc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/kajala/django-jacc)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kajala/django-jacc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kajala/django-jacc)\n\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\npip install django-jacc\n\n\nStatic Code Analysis\n====================\n\nThe library passes both prospector and mypy checking.
