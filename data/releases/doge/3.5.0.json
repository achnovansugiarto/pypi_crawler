    "description": "doge\n====\n\n![wow screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HxH9qka.png)\n\n\n**doge** is a simple motd script based on the slightly stupid but very funny\n[doge meme][doge]. It prints random grammatically incorrect statements that are\nsometimes based on things from your computer.\n\nFor more information about getting a setup like the one in the screenshot, see\n[this dotfiles repo][shameless].\n\n## Features\n\n* Randomly placed and colored random strings, complete with broken english.\n* Awesome Shibe in the terminal.\n* Fetching of system data, such as hostname, running processes, current user\n  and `$EDITOR`.\n* If you have [lolcat][lolcat], you can do this gem:\n  `while true; do doge | lolcat -a -d 100 -s 100 -p 1; done`\n  (thx [hom3chuk][hom3chuk])\n* stdin support: `ls /usr/bin | doge` will doge-print some of the executables\n  found in /usr/bin. wow. Also, the `-s` flag will filter out common words if\n  you are passing a body of text.\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install doge`\n\nIf you don't want to do that for whatever reason, there is a proper `setup.py`\nincluded, so `python setup.py install` should be just fine for that.\n\nNote that if you are one of the unlucky doges to still run a Python that does\nnot have argparse (<=Python2.6) you will have to install argparse manually from\npypi. so old, very update need.\n\nThen, just add a call to `doge` at the bottom of your shell rc file.\n\n## Notes\n\nYou need a terminal that supports 256 colors running on a system that supports\nunicode.\n\nThe terminal Shibe was created with hax0r Gimp skills and [img2xterm][i2x].\n\n[doge]: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge\n[i2x]: https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm\n[hom3chuk]: https://github.com/hom3chuk\n[lolcat]: https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat\n[shameless]: https://github.com/thiderman/dotfiles\n",
