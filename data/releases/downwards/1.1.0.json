    "description": "\n# downwards\n\nYou want to read a wikipedia page right from your terminal, right? RIGHT?\n\nI know because I wanted it.\n\n`downwards` is downloading the article you want, converts it to `mdoc` and\ndisplays it using your local `man` binary.\n\n```\n$ downwards OpenBSD\n$ downwards 'Theo de Raadt'\n$ downwards 'Python (Programming Langauge)'\n$ downwards --help\nUsage: downwards [OPTIONS] ARTICLE\n\n  downwards lets you read a wikipedia page on command line as a manpage.\n\nOptions:\n  -l, --language TEXT  Language for wikipedia\n  -s, --stdout         Print to stdout\n  --help               Show this message and exit.\n```\n\nI found it very helpful to set `export MANWIDTH=80` for nicely readable\ndocuments.\n\n# Installation\n\nInstallation\n\n```\npip3 install downwards\n```\n\nDevelopment\n\n```\npip3 install --upgrade .\n```\n\n# Background\n\nI wanted to play around with OpenBSDs `mandoc` and learn how `mdoc` works.\nThen I played around with Wikipedia and put both things together.\n\nHowever, once I got a first prototype up and running, I started liking it. It\nfeels like a \"reader\"-feature from your browser, but only from your terminal\nright at hand.\n\n# Bugs and Known Issues\n\nThere are always some things in automatically generated mdoc documents that\nthrow warnings. Since you cannot make `man` ignoring them, I need to press\n`ctrl+l` to reset those warnings.\n\n`man` is really not made to display a wide range of special utf8 characters\n(neither on OpenBSD, Linux nor macOS). I've done what I can to strip those\naway or replace german umlauts with `ae` for example.\n\n\n\n",
