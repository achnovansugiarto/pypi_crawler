    "description": "XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser\nwith a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds\nto a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to\ntransform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered\n'object oriented XSLT'.\n\nXIST also includes the following modules and packages:\n\n* ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a cross-platform templating language with\n  similar capabilities to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates\n  are compiled to an internal format, which makes it possible to implement\n  template renderers in other languages and makes the template code \"secure\"\n  (i.e. template code can't open or delete files).\n\n  __ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/templates/\n\n  There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.\n\n* ``ll.ul4on`` provides functions for encoding and decoding a lightweight\n  machine-readable text-based format for serializing the object types supported\n  by UL4. It is extensible to allow encoding/decoding arbitrary instances\n  (i.e. it is basically a reimplementation of ``pickle``, but with string\n  input/output instead of bytes and with an eye towards cross-plattform\n  support).\n\n  There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.\n\n* ``ll.orasql`` provides utilities for working with cx_Oracle_:\n\n  - It allows calling functions and procedures with keyword arguments.\n\n  - Query results will be put into Record objects, where database fields\n    are accessible as object attributes.\n\n  - The ``Connection`` class provides methods for iterating through the\n    database metadata.\n\n  - Importing the modules adds support for URLs with the scheme ``oracle`` to\n    ``ll.url``.\n\n  .. _cx_Oracle: https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/\n\n* ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows\n  you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed\n  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one\n  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented\n  way and targets are not only limited to files.\n\n* ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.\n  This includes the ability to convert between different color models\n  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions\n  for modifying and mixing colors.\n\n* ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.\n\n* ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396\n  compliant URLs.\n\n* ``ll.nightshade`` can be used to serve the output of PL/SQL\n  functions/procedures with CherryPy__.\n\n* ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.\n\n* ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape\n  sequences).\n\n* ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.\n\n* ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.\n\n__ http://www.cherrypy.org/\n\n\nChanges in 5.73 (released 2022-08-10)\n-------------------------------------\n\n* ``ll.pysql`` now supports Postgres. To connect to a Postgres database\n  pass a connectstring to ``connect`` starting with ``postgres:``, for\n  example::\n\n    connect(\"postgres:host=localhost dbname=test user=me password=secret\")\n\n  This will create a Postgres database connection via::\n\n    psycopg.connect(\n      \"host=localhost dbname=test user=me password=secret\",\n      cursor_factory=extras.DictCursor\n    )\n\n  All other connectstrings will be interpreted as Oracle connectstrings.\n  An Oracle connectstring may start with the prefix ``oracle:`` which will\n  be stripped off, before passing it to ``cx_Oracle.connect`` or\n  ``ll.orasql.connect``.\n\n  Note that Postgres currently doesn't support the ``drop_types``\n  command.\n\n* Some PySQL commands have been renamed: ``resetsequence`` to\n  ``reset_sequence``, ``checkerrors`` to ``check_errors``,\n  ``raiseexceptions`` to ``raise_exceptions``,\n  ``pushraiseexceptions`` to ``push_raise_exceptions`` and\n  ``popraiseexceptions`` to ``pop_raise_exceptions``.\n\n* The PySQL commands ``procedure`` and ``sql`` have an additional\n  argument ``argtypes`` that can be used to add casts to the parameter\n  values in the call to convert the value to the proper Postgres datatype\n  (to guide Postgres to find the correct overloaded version of the procedure).\n\n* When a ``var`` object is passed a second time in PySQL, now instead of\n  the variable's value a proper variable object will be passed to the\n  ``procedure`` or ``sql`` call. This means if the variable gets\n  changed by the call, the new value will be picked up by the local variable.\n\n  If you want to pass the variable's value instead as a simple IN parameter,\n  simply pass the local variable instead.\n\n* The argument ``raiseexceptions`` to various PySQL commands has been renamed\n  to ``raise_exceptions``.\n\n\n\n\n",
