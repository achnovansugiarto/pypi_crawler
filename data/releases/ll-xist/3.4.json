    "description": "XIST is an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser with a\nvery simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds to a\nPython class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to transform\nthe XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered 'object oriented XSLT'.\n\nXIST also includes the following modules:\n\n* ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape\n  sequences).\n\n* ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.\n  This includes the ability to convert between different color models\n  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions\n  for modifying and mixing colors.\n\n* ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows\n  you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed\n  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one\n  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented\n  way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement\n  e.g. dependencies on database records.\n\n* ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.\n\n* ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.\n\n* ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.\n\n* ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396\n  compliant URLs.\n\n* ``ll.xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python\n  expressions in text (as XML style processing instructions).\n\n* ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a templating language with similar capabilities\n  to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates are compiled to an\n  internal bytecode format, which makes it possible to implement template\n  renderers in other languages and makes the template code \"secure\" (i.e.\n  template code can't open or delete files).\n\n  __ http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/\n\n* ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.\n\n\nChanges in 3.4 (released 08/19/2008)\n------------------------------------\n\n* Templates can no longer be passed as a separate dictionary to UL4 templates\n  but are passed as variables like other data objects too.\n\n* Strings in UL4 have gained a new method ``capitalize``.\n\n* Printing XML escaped strings in UL4 has now gained its own tag and opcode.\n  ``<?printx foo?>`` is equivalent to ``<?print xmlescape(foo)?>``.\n\n* Exception handling in UL4 has been rewritten to allow proper error reporting\n  when calling nested templates.\n\n* UL4 has gained a new function ``zip``. It can be called with two or three\n  arguments and does what ``itertools.zip`` does.\n\n* UL4 has gained another new function: ``type`` returns the type of its\n  argument as a string.\n\n* UL4 now supports tuple unpacking in ``<?for?>`` tag with three variables.\n\n* UL4 has a new tag for comments: ``<?note This is comment?>``.\n\n* A new script ``db2ul4`` has been added that can render UL4 templates with\n  database content.\n\n* In UL4s ``<?render?>`` tags it's now possible to pass along a complete\n  argument dictionary via the ``**arg`` syntax just like in Python. This syntax\n  can even be used multiple times in the call. This syntax is available in\n  dictionary literals too, i.e. ``{1:2, 3:4}`` and ``{**{1:2}, **{3:4}}`` are\n  equivalent.\n\n* A new UL4 function ``get`` has beenm added that works similar to the\n  dictionary method ``get``, but works with global variables.\n\n* The missing processing instruction ``render`` has been added to\n  ``ll.xist.ns.ul4``.\n\n* ``xml_codec`` now partially works, even if the C module is missing. As\n  long as you explicitely specify an encoding on parsing and publishing, it\n  should work.\n\n* A new processing instruction class ``ll.xist.AttrProcInst`` has been\n  introduced. When an ``AttrProcInst`` node is the first node in an\n  attribute, it takes over publishing of the attribute. In all other cases\n  the processing instruction disappears completely. UL4 uses this to implement\n  \"conditional attributes\" (via the new classes ``attr_if`` and\n  ``attr_ifnn``).\n\n* Building trees with ``with`` blocks has changed slightly. Nodes used in\n  ``with`` blocks and with ``+`` are now passed to a ``with`` handler instead\n  of building the tree directly. This fixes a problem when nested\n  ``convert`` calls use ``with`` blocks.\n\n* The element ``ll.xist.ns.form.memo`` has been renamed to ``textarea``\n  and ``ll.xist.ns.form.edit`` has been renamed to ``text``. Classes\n  ``ll.xist.ns.form.button`` and ``ll.xist.ns.form.file`` have been\n  added.\n\n* Iterating through the inputs in ``ll.make`` actions has been fixed (i.e.\n  the additional inputs will be output too). ``ll.make.Project.findpaths``\n  has been fixed to work with non-``ll.make.Action`` inputs. (This means\n  that now you *have* to pass a real registered target action to\n  ``findpaths`` not just its key).\n\n* ``ll.make`` has gained a new action: ``XISTStringAction`` publishes\n  an XIST node as a unicode string. ``XISTPublishAction`` has been renamed\n  to ``XISTBytesAction``.\n\n* Fixed a bug in the caching logic in ``ll.make.CacheAction``.\n\n* ``ll.make.CallMethAction`` has been renamed to ``CallAttrAction``\n  because it can be used to e.g. call functions in a module too.\n\n* The properties ``showaction``, ``showstep`` and ``shownote`` of\n  ``ll.make.Project`` object can now be assigned booleans as well (which\n  results in *all* or *no* actions being shown.\n\n* The version number for ``cssutils`` has been bumped to 0.9.5.1.",
