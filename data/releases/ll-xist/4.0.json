    "description": "XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser\nwith a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds\nto a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to\ntransform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered\n'object oriented XSLT'.\n\nXIST also includes the following modules and packages:\n\n* ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a cross-platform templating language with\n  similar capabilities to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates\n  are compiled to an internal format, which makes it possible to implement\n  template renderers in other languages and makes the template code \"secure\"\n  (i.e. template code can't open or delete files).\n\n  __ http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/\n\n  There are implementations for Python, Java, Javascript and PHP.\n\n* ``ll.ul4on`` provides functions for encoding and decoding a lightweight\n  machine-readable text-based format for serializing the object types supported\n  by UL4. It is extensible to allow encoding/decoding arbitrary instances\n  (i.e. it is basically a reimplementation of ``pickle``, but with string\n  input/output instead of bytes and with an eye towards cross-plattform\n  support).\n\n  There are implementations for Python, Java, Javascript and PHP.\n\n* ``ll.orasql`` provides utilities for working with cx_Oracle_:\n\n  - It allows calling functions and procedures with keyword arguments.\n\n  - Query results will be put into Record objects, where database fields\n    are accessible as object attributes.\n\n  - The ``Connection`` class provides methods for iterating through the\n    database metadata.\n\n  - Importing the modules adds support for URLs with the scheme ``oracle`` to\n    ``ll.url``.\n\n  .. _cx_Oracle: http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/\n\n* ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows\n  you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed\n  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one\n  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented\n  way and targets are not only limited to files.\n\n* ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.\n  This includes the ability to convert between different color models\n  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions\n  for modifying and mixing colors.\n\n* ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.\n\n* ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396\n  compliant URLs.\n\n* ``ll.nightshade`` can be used to serve the output of PL/SQL\n  functions/procedures with CherryPy__.\n\n* ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.\n\n* ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape\n  sequences).\n\n* ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.\n\n* ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.\n\n__ http://www.cherrypy.org/\n\n\nChanges in 4.0 (released 08/08/2012)\n------------------------------------\n\n* The source has been ported to Python 3. From now on XIST is a Python 3 only\n  project. A big thanks goes to Martin v. LÃ¶wis, who got this conversion\n  started at PyCon DE 2011. He did the basic ``2to3`` conversion and updated\n  the C source to work on Python 3. Without Martin, XIST wouldn't have made\n  the leap to Python 3 for several years.\n\n* As there's no Python 3 port of libxml2_\\s Python wrapper, XIST now uses lxml_\n  for HTML parsing.\n\n  .. _libxml2: http://www.xmlsoft.org/\n  .. _lxml: http://lxml.de/\n\n  This change shouldn't have any visible consequences.\n\n* UL4 templates are no longer compiled to byte code, instead the AST is\n  evaluated or converted to the target sourcecode directly.\n\n* Generating the final Javascript source code for UL4 templates is now done in\n  Javascript itself.\n\n* A new module ``ul4on`` has been added. This module provides functions for\n  encoding and decoding a lightweight extensible machine-readable text format\n  for serializing the object types supported by UL4.\n\n* The following new functions have been added to UL4: ``isfirst``, ``islast``,\n  ``isfirstlast``, ``enumfl``. They are variants of ``enumerate`` that give\n  information about whether the item is the first and/or last item.\n\n* The following new functions have been added to UL4: ``urlquote`` and\n  ``urlunquote``. They encode/decode the ``%``-escaped form of URL query\n  parameters.\n\n* The UL4 function ``json`` has been renamed to ``asjson`` and the following\n  new UL4 functions have been added: ``fromjson``, ``asul4on`` and ``fromul4on``.\n\n* The UL4 function ``enumerate`` now supports 1 or 2 arguments (the second\n  argument being the start value).\n\n* The UL4 functions ``str``, ``bool``, ``int`` and ``float`` now support being\n  called without arguments (just like in Python).\n\n* Date constants in UL4 have changed again. They are now written like this:\n  ``@(2012-04-12)`` or ``@(2012-04-12T12:34:56)``.\n\n* The ``<?render?>`` tag in UL4 now looks like a method call instead of a\n  function call. I.e. ``<?render t(a=17, b=23)?>`` has changed to\n  ``<?render t.render(a=17, b=23)?>``.\n\n* UL4 stacktraces now use exception chaining to report the exception location\n  in nested templates.\n\n* The UL4 methods ``find`` and ``rfind`` now support lists and tuples.\n\n* Two new UL4 functions have been added: ``min`` and ``max``.\n\n* The sort order for attributes when publishing XIST trees can be overwritten\n  by setting the ``xmlorder`` class attribute to a string. This string will be\n  used for sorting the attribute. Attributes that have ``xmlorder`` set will\n  always be published before those that don't.\n\n* Support for the old ``ipipe`` infrastructure has been removed. Support for\n  IPythons new pretty printing infrastructure has been added. Output looks like\n  this::\n\n    In [1]: from ll.xist.ns import xml, html\n    In [2]: html.a(\n       ...:         'gurk',\n       ...:         xml.Attrs(lang='de'),\n       ...:         class_='link',\n       ...:         href='http://www.example.org/',\n       ...:         id='dings42',\n       ...: )\n    Out[2]:\n    ll.xist.ns.html.a(\n       'gurk',\n       ll.xist.ns.xml.Attrs.lang='de',\n       class_='link',\n       href='http://www.example.org/',\n       id='dings42')\n\n* Added the attributes ``allowfullscreen`` and ``flashvars`` to\n  ``ll.xist.ns.html.embed``.\n\n* Added the attribute ``allowfullscreen`` to  ``ll.xist.ns.html.iframe``.\n\n* The ``isdir`` method now always returns ``False`` for real (i.e.\n  non-file or ssh) URLs. This allows stuff like::\n\n    ucp http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tar.bz2 \\\n        ssh://user@www.example.org/~/src/\n\n* ``ll.orasql.Index`` now uses the ``*_INDEXES`` views to get a list of\n  all indexes and ``LOB`` indexes are filtered out, since they will be recreated\n  with the LOB itself. The method ``table`` has been fixed for indexes that\n  belong to a different user than the index.\n\n* ``ll.orasql.LOBStream`` has a new method ``seek``.\n\n* ``ll.make.FileAction`` supports encoding/decoding when writing/reading\n  the file. For this use the ``encoding`` and ``errors`` arguments.\n\n* The XIST node method ``sorted`` has been removed, as it no longer makes\n  sense, because with Python 3 nodes might be uncomparable.\n\n* Th support for ``%u`` escapes in URLs has been removed.\n\n* The function ``html.astext`` now uses the newer `links 2`_\n\n  .. _links 2: http://links.twibright.com/\n\n* The scripts ``oracreate``, ``oradrop``, ``oradelete``, ``oradiff``,\n  ``oramerge``, ``oragrant``, ``orafind`` and ``uhpp`` no longer have an\n  ``-e``/``--encoding`` option. They always use Pythons output\n  encoding.\n\n* The options ``-i``/``--inputencoding`` and\n  ``-o``/``--outputencoding`` of the script ``db2ul4`` have been\n  replaced with an option ``-e``/``--encoding`` for the encoding\n  of the template files. For printing the result Pythons output encoding is\n  used.\n\n* The options ``--inputencoding``,/``--inputerrors`` and\n  ``--outputencoding``/``--outputerrors`` of\n  ``ll.sisyphus.Job`` have been replaced with option\n  ``--encoding``/``--errors`` for the encoding of the log files.\n\n* ``oradiff`` now iterates through the object in correct order, so if you're\n  running ``oradiff`` with ``-mfull`` the output shouldn't produce any errors\n  when executed.\n\n* ``ll.orasql.Index`` can now handle domain indexes.\n\n* ``ll.orasql.Preference`` has been added.\n\n* ``ll.orasql`` now ignores indexes of type ``IOT - TOP``.\n\n* ``ll.orasql`` can now handle primary keys where the underlying index has\n  a different name.\n\n* ``ll.orasql`` now ignores tables with names starting with ``DR$``\n  (i.e. those created by Oracle Text Search).\n\n* Attributes of ``ll.misc.SysInfo`` instances are now calculated on\n  demand. With this change only one instance of ``ll.misc.SysInfo`` is\n  required. This instance is ``ll.misc.sysinfo``.\n\n* When connecting to the database ``ll.orasql`` sets the ``client_info``\n  attribute to the name of the running script (unless ``clientinfo=None`` is\n  passed to the ``connect`` call).\n\n* ``ll.xist.ns.specials.loremipsum`` now repeats the text if the specified\n  ``len`` attribute is greater that the length of the lorem ipsum text.",
