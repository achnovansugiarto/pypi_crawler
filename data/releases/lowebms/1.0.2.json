    "description": "This python package is an implementation of low-dimensional energy balance models.\n\nIt shall serves as a framework to compile and simulate energy balance models from a collection of parameterizations which describe the energy transport of reduced/simplified earth system.\n\nModels (Parameterizations) implemented are:\n-0D energy balance models\n-1D energy balance models\n\nThe range of applications and features is constantly extended. They focus on:\n-Exploration and quantification of parameterizations describing the climate system\n-Exploration and quantification of radiative climate forcings \n-Fast and accessible tools to analyze climate system simulations\n-Tools for the optimization of parameterizations \n\nThe most implementations are based on the work of former developers of climate models which are tried to be gathered and combined within this package. The central approaches to formulate energy balance models included in this package are based on the publications from Sellers (1969) and Budyko (1968).\n\nA detailed description of the implementations, installation, usage, future plans and further references can be found in the packages documentation.\n\nFor more information please see:\n\nhttps://lowebms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\nYou are very welcome to work with this package and extend it to allow an application to anything you are interested.\nIf you are interested in contributing to this project or have problems with the usage, feel free to contact me:\n\nBenjamin Schmiedel (mail: benny.schmiedel@gmail.com, github-username: BenniSchmiedel)",
