    "description": "===================\nDjango-CMS Layouter\n===================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Blueshoe/djangocms-layouter.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/Blueshoe/djangocms-layouter\n    :alt: Code analysis status\n\n**Django-CMS Layouter** is a plugin for **Django CMS** which aims to provide a grid system for authors and editors\nwith a high ease of use and comprehensibility. It is leveraging `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ (version 3 and 4 supported) as it\nis a very popular framework to create responsive websites.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blueshoe/djangocms-layouter/master/layouter.gif\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nPlease feel free to contribute and help us to improve **Django-CMS Layouter**.\n\nInstallation and Configuration\n------------------------------\n\n**Django-CMS Layouter** supports Django-CMS>=3.4. It may work with any older version.\n\n* Install via pip: ``pip install djangocms-layouter``.\n* Add ``layouter`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n* Add ``url(r'^layouter/', include('layouter.urls', namespace='layouter'), )`` to your url config\n* Run migrations: ``python manage.py migrate layouter``.\n* Set the setting ``LAYOUTER_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION`` to 3 or 4.\n* Done.\n\nPlease note: Migrations are generated each release. If you checkout the current state of development\nmigrations might be missing.\n\n**Static files**\n\nThe required CSS and JavaScript files are added to the sekizai blocks ``css`` and ``js``. If you don't use these blocks, you need to manually add the static files:\n\n- ``layouter/css/layouter.css``\n- ``layouter/js/layouter.js``\n\nBoth are only required when the toolbar is in ``edit_mode``.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nThese are the core features of **Django-CMS Layouter**:\n\n* Flat tree in structure mode\n* Automatic arrangement of columns, for different screen sizes\n* Warning, due to too many plugins, in structure mode\n* Optional equal height for columns (uses CSS3 flexbox)\n* Toggle grid - show and hide grid in content mode\n\nMigrating to Django>=2\n----------------------\n\nThere is not much you need to do. Just run update and ``python manage.py migrate``.\n\n\nToDo's\n------\n\nNo software is perfect, everyone's code sucks. Feel free to suggest, criticize and/or contribute.\n\n**Dynamic Warning Updates** - Dragging and Dropping in the structure view does not update the warnings within the\nplugin.\n\n**Add support for Divio Cloud** - Adding support for the Divio Cloud, so that the Layouter is installable via\nDivio Cloud control panel.\n\n**Author / Editor Documentation** - IMHO this is one of the things Django-CMS lacks. We need more and better resources\nfor authors and editors. Not only for Django-CMS, this plugin needs it to, for sure.\n\n**Advanced Mode** - Not completely sure what it should look like. The current implementation is very limited\nwhen it comes to adapting columns for different screen sizes or using more than 4 columns. It currently is completely\ndefined by this plugin, which can be good, but does not have to be. Some users want the plugin to take care, others want\nto control the behaviour themselves.\n\n**Tests** - There should be something like casper.js tests, maybe there is something better.",
