    "description": "# About this project\nThis tool was created to help manage a DraftKings league as the commissioner. It used to be a script that was used to generate a blog post template for [Platanofb.com](https://platanofb.com), a GitHub Pages project. Now, this tool is a group of functions that can be called to return data, which makes integration with other projects, like a Flask website, possible. \n\nOne of the new features is `login_to_dk()` which logs in to DraftKings and stores/loads cookies; this enables getting contest details automatically, an improvement over downloading the contest results CSV and supplying the file to the old script. A wiki will be updated to describe usage of each function, although they are appropriately named and comments are included inline with the code.\n\n# Usage\nCreate a session to be passed to the functions of dkextract\n```\nimport dkextract, requests\n\ns = requests.session()\ndkextract.get_all_players(session=s, week=1, year=2020)\n```\n\n## DraftKings credentials and other values\nThis tool will look for DraftKings credentials in the following environment variables:\n```\nexport DKUSER=dkuser@email.com\nexport DKPASS=dkp@ssw0rd\n```\n\nSome other values that are not obvious when using the tool:\n```\nall_members = set([\"dk_username1\", \"dk_username2\", \"dk_username3\"])\nwinning_values = {1: 100, 2: 50, 3: 25}\n```\n- `all_members` is a **set** of all DraftKings member names\n- `winning_values` is a value assigned to a rank. In this example, first place (rank 1 or `1:`) is assigned a value of `100`. Pass this to `generate_results()`\n\n# Thank you\nThanks for taking a look at my tool. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions, but notice, this code was created and written for fun.\n\n",
