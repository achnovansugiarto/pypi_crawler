You declare a standard `Engine` like so:\n\n    with Engine() as engine:\n        # PUT YOUR LANGUAGE DEFINITION HERE\n\nIf you are declaring a large language, and you want to minimize indentation, and you are careful, you may also use this pattern:\n\n    engine = Engine().use()\n    # PUT YOUR LANGUAGE DEFINITION HERE\n    engine.release()\n\nThe engine can be used to set global parsing parameters, like\n\n* `set_whitespace()` - set the ignored characters (like whitespace)\n* `add_ignore()` - include whole patterns that are ignored (like comments)\n* `set_debug_actions()` - insert functions to run for detailed debugging\n* `set_literal()` - Set the definition for what `Literal()` means\n* `set_keyword_chars()` - For default `Keyword()`\n\nThe `engine.CURRENT` is added to every parse element created, and it is used during parsing to packrat the current parsed string. \n\n\n### Navigating ParseResults\n\n`ParseResults` are in the form of an n-ary tree; with the children found in `ParseResults.tokens`.  Each `ParseResult.type` points to the `ParserElement` that made it.  In general, if you want to get fancy with post processing (or in a `parseAction`), you will be required to navigate the raw `tokens` to generate a final result\n\nThere are some convenience methods;  \n* `__iter__()` - allows you to iterate through parse results in **depth first search**. Empty results are skipped, and `Group`ed  results are treated as atoms (which can be further iterated if required) \n* `name` is a convenient property for `ParseResults.type.token_name`\n* `__getitem__()` - allows you to jump into the parse tree to the given `name`. This is blocked by any names found inside `Group`ed results (because groups are considered atoms).      \n\n### addParseAction\n\nParse actions are methods that are run after a ParserElement found a match. \n\n* Parameters must be accepted in `(tokens, index, string)` order (the opposite of pyparsing)\n* Parse actions are wrapped to ensure the output is a legitimate ParseResult\n  * If your parse action returns `None` then the result is the original `tokens`\n  * If your parse action returns an object, or list, or tuple, then it will be packaged in a `ParseResult` with same type as `tokens`.\n  * If your parse action returns a `ParseResult` then it is accepted ***even if is belongs to some other pattern***",
