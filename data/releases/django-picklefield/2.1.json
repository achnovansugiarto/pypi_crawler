Currently pickle fields are serialized as\nbase64-encoded pickles, which allows reliable deserialization, but such a\nformat is not convenient for parsing in the browser.  By overriding\n``value_to_string()`` you can choose a more convenient serialization format.\n\nFields now accept the boolean key word argument `copy`, which defaults to\n`True`. The `copy` is necessary for lookups to work correctly. If you don't\ncare about performing lookups on the picklefield, you can set `copy=False` to\nsave on some memory usage. This an be especially beneficial for very large\nobject trees.\n\n-------------\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nThe full test suite can be run with `Tox`_::\n\n    >>> pip install tox\n    >>> tox\n\n.. _Tox: https://testrun.org/tox/latest/\n\n--------------\nOriginal notes\n--------------\n\nHere are the notes by taavi223, the original author:\n\nIncredibly useful for storing just about anything in the database (provided it\nis Pickle-able, of course) when there isn't a 'proper' field for the job.\n\nPickledObjectField is database-agnostic, and should work with any database\nbackend you can throw at it. You can pass in any Python object and it will\nautomagically be converted behind the scenes. You never have to manually pickle\nor unpickle anything. Also works fine when querying; supports exact, in, and\nisnull lookups. It should be noted, however, that calling QuerySet.values()\nwill only return the encoded data, not the original Python object.\n\nThis PickledObjectField has a few improvements over the one in snippet #513.\n\nThis one solves the DjangoUnicodeDecodeError problem when saving an object\ncontaining non-ASCII data by base64 encoding the pickled output stream. This\nensures that all stored data is ASCII, eliminating the problem.\n\nPickledObjectField will now optionally use zlib to compress (and uncompress)\npickled objects on the fly. This can be set per-field using the keyword\nargument \"compress=True\". For most items this is probably not worth the small\nperformance penalty, but for Models with larger objects, it can be a real space\nsaver.\n\nYou can also now specify the pickle protocol per-field, using the protocol\nkeyword argument. The default of 2 should always work, unless you are trying to\naccess the data from outside of the Django ORM.\n\nWorked around a rare issue when using the cPickle and performing lookups of\ncomplex data types. In short, cPickle would sometimes output different streams\nfor the same object depending on how it was referenced. This of course could\ncause lookups for complex objects to fail, even when a matching object exists.\nSee the docstrings and tests for more information.\n\nYou can now use the isnull lookup and have it function as expected. A\nconsequence of this is that by default, PickledObjectField has null=True set\n(you can of course pass null=False if you want to change that). If null=False\nis set (the default for fields), then you wouldn't be able to store a Python\nNone value, since None values aren't pickled or encoded (this in turn is what\nmakes the isnull lookup possible).\n\nYou can now pass in an object as the default argument for the field without it\nbeing converted to a unicode string first. If you pass in a callable though,\nthe field will still call it. It will not try to pickle and encode it.\n\nYou can manually import dbsafe_encode and dbsafe_decode from fields.py if you\nwant to encode and decode objects yourself. This is mostly useful for decoding\nvalues returned from calling QuerySet.values(), which are still encoded\nstrings.\n\nNote: If you are trying to store other django models in the PickledObjectField,\nplease see the comments for a discussion on the problems associated with doing\nthat. The easy solution is to put django models into a list or tuple before\nassigning them to the PickledObjectField.\n\nUpdate 9/2/09: Fixed the value_to_string method so that serialization should\nnow work as expected. Also added deepcopy back into dbsafe_encode, fixing #4\nabove, since deepcopy had somehow managed to remove itself. This means that\nlookups should once again work as expected in all situations. Also made the\nfield editable=False by default (which I swear I already did once before!)\nsince it is never a good idea to have a PickledObjectField be user editable.\n\n-------\nChanges\n-------\n\nChanges in version 2.1.0\n========================\n\n* Added official support for Django 2.2 (thanks to joehybird).\n* Dropped support for Django 2.0 and 2.1 (thanks to joehybird).\n* Dropped support for Python 3.4 (thanks to joehybidd).\n\nChanges in version 2.0.0\n========================\n\n* Silenced ``RemovedInDjango30Warning`` warnings on Django 2.0+ (thanks to\n  canarduck).\n* Restructured project directories.\n* Disallowed the usage of empty strings for ``PickledObjectField``.
