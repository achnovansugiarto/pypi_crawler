    "description": "Hi there !\n\nThe goal here is to let you download your favorite mangas from scan websites, and to convert them automatically into pdf files. Thus, it's easier to read when you don't have an internet access, or if you just don't want ad.\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install it, you must have a [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/) installed, with a working pip.\nThen, you can use the pip command :\n\n    pip install mangas-dl\n\nThis command will update mangas-dl if you already have it. See the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/mangas-dl/).\n\nOther ways of download are going to be added.\n\n# Description\n\n**mangas-dl** is a command-line program to download manga scans from multiple websites ([list of websites taken in charge](https://github.com/Boubou0909/Mangas-dl#list-of-websites-staken-in-charge)).\nIt requires a [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/), and is not platform specific.\nIt is released to the public domain, so you can use it, modify it, redistribute it however you want.\n\n    mangas-dl\n\n# One-line mode\n\nTo launch the one-line mode, you have to run the command :\n    mangas-dl [OPTIONS] URL\n\nThe only option to be filled in is the path where you want the scans to be saved.\nBy default, all the chapters are downloaded and the default language is english.\n\n## Options\n    -h, --help                          Print help text and exit\n\n    --version                           Print the current version and exit\n    \n    -p, --path                          Path to the folder where the scans will be downloaded\n\n    -l, --language                      Choose the language with the language code (see language_codes.json)\n    \n    -c, --chapters                      Choose which chapters will be downloaded (see the format in\n                                        the interactive mode description)\n\n    -n, --name                          Change the name of the final folder (where the chapter(s) \n                                        will be downloaded). If not specified, an automatic one will\n                                        be used (the one available on the main page given). Put the name in \n                                        quotes if it has more than one word.\n\n    --list                              Print the complete list of available chapters with the settings\n                                        (path not necessary) without download them. Relaunch another \n                                        command to download choosen ones.\n\n# Interactive mode\n\nTo launch the interactive mode, you have to run the .exe file with the command :\n    mangas-dl\n\n## Answers format\n\nIn the interactive mode, you will have to answer questions to specify what you want to download exactly. To make the program understand your answers, make sure to use those formats :\n\n- **Manga's main page** : URL of the main page of the manga ([See this section for further informations](https://github.com/Boubou0909/Mangas-dl#example-of-mangas-main-page)).\n- **Language** *optional* : Give the number correponding to the language you want to choose.\n- **Chapters to download** : Give the numbers of the first and the last chapters you want to download, separated by a dash. If you want to download several intervals, separate them by a slash. If the number of the first and the last chapters are integers, you can write them normally. If not, you have to specify with float numbers. To download all chapters, you can enter just '*', '-1' or leave blank. Moreover, you can tap \"list\" to have the complete list of the chapters that have been found, then the program will reask you the same question (\"list\" option won't be available the second time).\n- **Name of the final folder** : Name of new folder where the chapter(s) will be downloaded. To make it automatic, you can leave this field blank.\n- **Destination folder** : Give the absolute path to the folder where the scans will be located. A new folder will be created inside with the name of the manga.\n- **Y/N questions** : Answer with 'Y'/'y'/1 or 'N'/'n'/0\n\n# Commands\n\nTo launch a command, the general usage is :\n    mangas-dl <command> [OPTIONS]\n\n## Remember preferences \n    save_path PATH                      Remember PATH to be the default folder where the scans \n                                        will be downloaded\n\n    save_language LANGUAGE_CODE         Remember LANGUAGE_CODE to be the default language if a choice\n                                        is possible\n\n## Use remembered informations\n\nYou can reuse remembered informations in one-line mode : instead of a path, you can write \"%\" if a path is remembered, and you can leave language blank if a choice is possible (english will be taken if the language is not available). \n\n# List of websites taken in charge\n\n- [https://mangadex.org/](https://mangadex.org/)\n- [https://manganelo.tv/](https://manganelo.tv/)\n- [https://cubari.moe/](https://cubari.moe/)\n\n# Examples\n\n## Example of mangas' main page\n\n- mangadex.org : [https://mangadex.org/title/32d76d19-8a05-4db0-9fc2-e0b0648fe9d0](https://mangadex.org/title/32d76d19-8a05-4db0-9fc2-e0b0648fe9d0)\n- manganelo.tv : [https://manganelo.tv/manga/manga-dr980474](https://manganelo.tv/manga/manga-dr980474)\n- cubari.moe (several chapters): [https://cubari.moe/read/gist/JO7JN/](https://cubari.moe/read/gist/JO7JN/)\n- cubari.moe (one chapter) : [https://cubari.moe/read/imgur/Xo1KODZ/](https://cubari.moe/read/imgur/Xo1KODZ/)\n\n## Examples of one-line mode command\n\n    > mangas-dl -p C:\\This\\is\\a\\path -c 1-7 https://mangadex.org/title/a96676e5-8ae2-425e-b549-7f15dd34a6d8\n    \n    > mangas-dl -n \"Kumo desu ga !\" -p % -l nl https://mangadex.org/title/eb2d1a45-d4e7-4e32-a171-b5b029c5b0cb\n\n## Example of interactive mode command\n\n    > mangas-dl\n    Enter the main page of the manga you want to download : https://mangadex.org/title/a96676e5-8ae2-425e-b549-7f15dd34a6d8\n    17 languages have been found.\n    0 -> Italian\n    1 -> Turkish\n    2 -> Indonesian\n    3 -> Russian\n    4 -> Portuguese (Brasil)\n    5 -> English\n    6 -> Filipino\n    7 -> Persian\n    8 -> Dutch\n    9 -> Mongolian\n    10 -> Czech\n    11 -> Hungarian\n    12 -> Spanish (LATAM)\n    13 -> French\n    15 -> Hindi\n    16 -> Romanian\n    Choose a language (number) : 5\n    192 chapters have been found (from 1.0 to 296.0).\n    Which chapter(s) would you like to download ? 1-7\n    Destination folder : C:\\Users\\balth\\Documents\\Scans\n    Do you want to save this path ?

This is necessary because of the anti-DDOS system. Thus, web-scraping is impossible because it is too fast for the website (it will understand that you're using a bot). However, manganelo.tv : [https://manganelo.tv/manga/manga-dr980474](https://manganelo.tv/manga/manga-dr980474) doesn't have such system, so web scraping is possible, and is much faster.\n\n## Will other websites be implemented in the future ?\n\nOf course : the final goal is that everyone can download their mangas wherever they want, so if you have a website you would like to be added to this project (and if it's enough important to be really useful to other people), I will try to add it to this project.\n\n",
