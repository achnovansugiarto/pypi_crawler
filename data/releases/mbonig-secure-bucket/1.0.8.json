    "description": "# A CDK L3 Construct for a Secure Bucket\n\nThis is an AWS CDK L3 Construct used to demonstrate the development and publishing process with the AWS CDK.\n\nPlease refer to the blog post [here](https://www.matthewbonig.com/2020/01/11/creating-constructs) for more information.\n\n## Usage\n\nJust import and use it.\n\n```python\n# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826\nimport aws_cdk.core as cdk\nfrom secure_bucket import SecureBucket\n\nclass SandboxCdkStack(cdk.Stack):\n    def __init__(self, scope, id, *, description=None, env=None, stackName=None, tags=None):\n        super().__init__(scope, id, description=description, env=env, stackName=stackName, tags=tags)\n\n        SecureBucket(self, \"myBucket\")\n```\n\n## Encryption options\n\nThis is just a wrapper around an S3 Bucket and the [props](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.BucketProps.html) are shared.\n\nHowever, you cannot supply an `UNENCRYPTED` option for the `encryption` property. If you do, or don't set it at all, it will use the `BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED` value by default.\n\n## Integration Test\n\nIf you want to see full usage, you can run\n\n```shell script\n$ cdk synth\n```\n\nto produce a basic stack with one SecureBucket resource\n\n## L2 Construct - Inheritance vs Composition\n\nThis construct is a wrapper around a standard L2 Bucket. However, because it wraps it, you can't just use it in all\nthe same places you could use a standard L2 bucket. You have to pass around the public field `.bucket` from the construct.\nThis was done as it's more representative of the types of constructs I expect people to build (composed of multiple L2s).\nHowever, if you were to actually want to use this construct in a production environment you'd\nprobably use the inheritance model instead. Checkout the [feature/inheritance](https://github.com/mbonig/secure-bucket/tree/feature/inheritance) branch for that version.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n\n",
