But please\n  report them, and we'll get them fixed.\n\n  We just don't want you to have a bad first experience.\n\n  Aka, *you've been warned!*\n\n  (Nonetheless, the ``dob`` beta uses a backup file judiciously,\n  so if it does crash, you should not lose any unsaved data.)\n\ndob is already feature-rich, and it's used daily (hourly!) by\nthe authors.\n\nTo see what all the fuss is about, you can ``pip3 install dob``\nand run ``dob demo`` right now to try it out.\n\nOr, keep reading for an overview of dob, a list of its features,\nand then detailed documentation of the interactive editor commands.\n\nOS Support\n==========\n\n``dob`` runs on any operating system that supports Python,\nincluding Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nPlease see the |install-guide|_ for help getting setup.\n\n###########\nQuick Start\n###########\n\nIf you want to dive right in (after running the demo to get acquainted), try::\n\n   $ dob init\n   $ dob edit\n\nThe ``init`` command creates a config file and the database,\nand the ``edit`` command runs the interactive editor.\n\nYou can also run ``dob --help`` to see an overview of all commands.\n\n#####\nEthos\n#####\n\n``dob`` is a designed for developers, but suitable\nfor any individual whose comfortable in the terminal.\n\n``dob`` is perfect for the person who asks,\n*Why must I use my mouse to manage time tracking?*\n\n``dob`` is even more suited for the person who asks,\n*How can I manage time tracking with the fewest possible keystrokes?*\n\n``dob`` is inspired by\n`Hamster <https://github.com/projecthamster/>`__,\na beloved but aged time tracking application for\n`GNOME <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME>`__.\n\n``dob`` is emulative of `Vim <https://www.vim.org/>`__,\nan editor that enables users to concentrate on their\nwork while the tool itself slips into the background.\n\nTry ``dob`` today -- you might like it!\n\n- `Demo dob`_ to learn it.\n\n- | Then, `start from scratch`__,\n  | or `load a legacy database`__.\n\n__ https://dob.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#start-fresh\n\n__ https://dob.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#upgrade-hamster\n\nIf you like |dob|_, hopefully you'll\n`help us make it better\n<https://dob.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_!\n\n########\nFeatures\n########\n\n- Minimalist interactive console app fits elegantly into your terminal-based workflow.\n\n- Robust configuration -- and manageable via CLI if you want to avoid the config file.\n\n- Fully customizable -- change which keys map to which commands.\n\n- Define your own user-specific paste commands -- assign your own activities and tags.\n\n- Undo and redo edits as you work -- don't worry if you make a mistake.\n\n- Auto-complete makes it easy to set activities and tags -- and shows

colors -- you can even style your own activity and tag names!\n\n- Natural syntax lets you go \"offline\" and dob to a text file, that you can import later.\n\n- Migrates legacy Hamster databases -- and repairs integrity issues, too.\n\n- Supports unrestricted plugin access -- anyone can add their own commands and config.\n\n- Includes command shortcuts -- common command sequences mapped to a single keypress.\n\n- Runs on the latest Python (3.6, 3.7, and 3.8).\n\n- Broad desktop OS support -- runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n- Suitably tested (though coverage could be better).\n\n- Well documented -- get help at runtime, on the command line, or online.\n\n- Simple, smooth code base -- follows best practices, and uses top libraries.\n\n- Low bar of entry to get raw access to data

to write their own\nfeatures and to share them with the broader community.\n\nThe core development team has created the following plugins\nfor non-essential and distribution-specific features.\n\n*Please note: these plugins are not yet published!*\n(We just want to get you excited in the meantime.)\n\n- The ``dob-plugin-export-commit``\n  plugin exports and commits changes to your dob database on every save.\n\n- The ``dob-plugin-stale-fact-goader``\n  plugin displays a GNOME-style popup notification after some amount of\n  inactivity to badger you to start a new Fact.\n\n- The ``dob-plugin-git-hip``\n  plugin tags the active Fact based on the Git branch name\n  pulled from the current directory.\n\nHave a great idea for ``dob``? Implement it as a plugin!\n\n- Plugins have complete access to dob.\n\n  Plugins can add their own commands.\n\n  Plugins can add their own configuration.\n\n  Plugins can run on startup, on exit, or whenever the user saves.\n\nPlugins help keep ``dob`` lean, and they let you turn\nan idea into a feature quickly and easily!\n\n#######\nThanks!\n#######\n\nWe hope you enjoy using dob as much as we have had making it!\n\nAnd if you like it, please tell your friends and colleagues about it.\nTell the whole world!!\n\nKeep on dobbin'!\n\n\n\n",
