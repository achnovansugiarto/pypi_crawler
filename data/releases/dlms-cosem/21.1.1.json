It provides the lowest level function, as protocol state\nmanagement, APDU encoding/decoding, APDU encryption/decryption.\n\nThe library aims to provide a [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) implementation\nof the DLMS/COSEM protocol so that the protocol code can be reused with several\ndifferent io-paradigms. As of now we provide a simple client implementation based on\nblocking I/O.\n\nWe have not implemented full support to be able to build a server (meter) emulator. If\nthis is a use-case you need, consider sponsoring the development and contact us.\n\n# Supported features\n\nCurrent release:\n\n    * Parsing DataNotification via UDP.\n\nCurrent Work:\n\n    * GET, GET.WITH_BLOCK\n    * Simple blocking DLMS Client for HDLC and TCP/IP\n    * GlobalCiphering\n    * HLS-GMAC auth\n    * Selective access for ProfileGeneric via RangeDescriptor\n    * Parsing of ProfileGeneric buffers\n\n# Example use:\n\nLook at the different file in the `examples` folder to how to use the library.\n\n# Supported meters\n\nTechnically we aim to support any DLMS enabled meter. The library is implementing all\nthe low level DLMS, and you might need an abstraction layer to support everything in\nyour meter.\n\nDLMS/COSEM specifies many ways of performing tasks on a meter. It is\ncustomary that a meter also adheres to a companion standard. In the companion standard\nit is defined exactly how certain use-cases are to be performed and how data is modeled.\n\nExamples of companion standards are:\n* DSMR (Netherlands)\n* IDIS (all Europe)\n* UNI/TS 11291 (Italy)\n\nOn top of it all your DSO (Distribution Service Operator) might have ordered their\nmeters with extra functionality or reduced functionality from one of the companion\nstandards.\n\nWe have some meters we have run tests on or know the library is used for in production\n\n* Pietro Fiorentini RSE 1,2 LA N1. Italian gas meter\n* Iskraemeco AM550. IDIS compliant electricity meter.\n\n# Development\n\nThis library is developed by Palmlund Wahlgren Innovative Technology AB. We are\nbased in Sweden and are members of the DLMS User Association.\n\nIf you find a bug pleas raise an issue on Github.\n\nWe welcome contributions of any kind.\n\nWe add features depending on our own and our clients use cases. If you\nneed a feature implemented please contact us.\n\n# Training / Consultancy / Commercial Support\n\nWe offer consultancy service and training services around this library and general DLMS/COSEM.\nIf you are interested in our services just reach out to us.\n\nIf you have implemented a solution based on this library we also offer a commercial\nsupport scheme.\n\n\n\n# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/)\n\n## Unreleased\n\n\n### Added\n\n* Better handling of TCP errors in `BlockingTcpTransport`\n\n\n### Changed\n\n### Deprecated\n\n### Removed\n\n### Fixed\n\n### Security\n\n\n## [21.1.1] - 2021-01-13\n\n### Added\n\n* Better handling of TCP errors in `BlockingTcpTransport`\n\n### Changed\n\n* It is now explicitly possible to connect and disconnect a transport in the\n  `DlmsClient` instead of it being done automatically in `.associate()` and\n  `.release_association()`. Context manager `.session()` works the same.\n\n* Client to server challenge of DlmsConnection is always created independent of auth\n  method. But only used if needed.\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed conformance validation in DlmsConnection. It seems like meters don't always\n  follow it so better to leave it up to the client.\n\n\n\n## [21.1.0] - 2021-01-12\n\n### Added\n\n* HDLC transport implementation\n* TCP transport implementation\n* DlMS client implementation\n* Support for Get service including service specific block transfer\n* Support for selective access via range descriptor\n* Support for HLS authentication using HLS-GMAC.\n* Support for GlobalCiphering\n* Parsing of ProfileGeneric buffer\n\n### Changed\n\n* Changed project versioning scheme to Calendar versioning\n\n\n## v0.0.2\n\n\n### Changed\n\n-   UDP messages are now based WrapperProtocolDataUnit to be able to reuse\n    WrapperHeader for TCP messages.\n-   Parsing of DLMS APDUs\n\n\n### v0.0.1\n\n\nInitial implementation.\n\n\n",
