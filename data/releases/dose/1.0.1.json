    "description": "Dose\n====\nDirectory and watching\n----------------------\n\n**Dose** watches one directory for any kind of change\nnew file, file modified, file removed, subdirectory renamed,\netc., including its subdirectories, by using the Python\nwatchdog package. For example, changes on files ending on\n'.pyc' and '.pyo' are neglect by default, as well as git\ninternals, but these skip patterns are *customizable*.\n\nWhat happens when something changes?\n------------------------------------\n\nA *customized* subprocess is called, all its output/error\ndata is left on the shell used to call Dose, and its return\nvalue is stored. If the value is zero, the semaphore turns\ngreen, else it it turns red. It stays yellow while waiting\nthe subprocess to finish.\n\nIs it easy to use or should I spend hours to set it up?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default directory path to watch is the one used to call\nDose. There's no default calling string, but 'nosetests' and\n'py.test' would be hints for Python developers. It should\nwork even with other languages TDD tools. To be fast, just\nopen Dose and double click on it, there's no need to lose\ntime with settings.\n\nAnd the GUI?\n------------\n\nThe GUI toolkit used in this project is wxPython. You can\nmove the semaphore by dragging it around. Doing so with\nCtrl pressed would resize it. With Shift you change its\ntransparency (not available on Linux, for now). The\nsemaphore window always stays on top. A right click would\nshow all options available.",
