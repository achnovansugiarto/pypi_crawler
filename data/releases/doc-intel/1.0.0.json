    "description": "# doc_intel\n\n`pip install doc-intel`\n\n\n###### This package is subject to several potential fixes and until then any benefits derived by using this is very much intended. \n\n### doc_intel is your solution to a largely cleansed and intact text extract from a PDF. \n\n\n###### change 0.0.1 (8 / 23 / 2021) :\n   * Line breaks lead to breakage of full words into smaller potentially non dictionary words and changes have been made to fix that. \n   * A dictionary has been used to identify how to reconstruct the broken words. \n###### change 0.0.2 (8 / 28 / 2021) :                         \n   * Updated dictionary, maybe inverse document frequency will later be used instead to fix the line breaks. \n   * Inverse document frequency has been used to precisely split and reconstruct stitched or meaninglessly spaced words. \n###### change 0.0.3 (9 / 10 / 2021) :\n   * added and removed words in word.txt, fixed dot spacing and conserved number word detachment post processing\" \n\n###### change 0.0.4 (9 / 14 / 2021) :\n   * added and removed words in word.txt, maintained the positions of apostrophes.\n\n### Major Version Update 1.0.0 (19 / 10 / 2021) :\n   * A new module has been added for to serve requirements of deletion and addition of words in the word text file. \n   * Usage demonstration can be found under the feature instruction section. \n\n\n## Feature instruction:\n\n#### REMOVE THE HEADER AND FOOTER TERMS FORM YOUR DOCUMENT: \n\n```\nfrom doc_intel import text_laundry\n\nfile_path = / your_path/ your_file.pdf\n\ntexts = text_laundry.head_foot(file_path).remove()\n```\n\n#### SCRUB OFF TEXTUAL NOISE FROM YOUR TEXTS:\n\n###### Arguments : \n\n* **serial numerical noise** [bool]: noise like `(text) + (random numbers, spaced or continous)` will be removed. \n\n* **sentences or words interrupted with special characters** [bool] : All cohesive words and sentences interruptions like  `co -hesive` or `sol **utions` should be removed.\n\n* **lower case** [bool] : toggle between bool values for lower or upper casing. \n\n* `s u b s t r i n g s w h i c h a r e a t t a c h e d w i l l b e s e p a r a t e d` --> ``substrings which are attached will be separated`` (based on the fequency of the constituent words in the document). \n\n```\ntext_object = text_laundry.load_text([input str], remove_serial, sents_or_word_breaks, lower)\ncleaned_text = text_object.launder()\n```\n\n#### **ADD** AND **DELETE** WORDS FROM IN-BUILT DICTIONARY:\n\n* PDF documents are not purposely written to suite document extraction and therefore, a lot of discontinued words in the documents end up broken with ordinary text extraction. \n* doc-intel's in-built dictionary support identification of many 1000s of words which is now **editable**. Add and remove words as you require for your smooth text extraction. \n* `do-cument` --> `document`\n\n```\nfrom doc_intel import manage_diction\n\nword_list = \" your list of words to either add or delete \"\nmanage_diction.register_words(word_list).Add()  #or\nmanage_diction.register_words(word_list).Delete()\n```\n\n\n###### **Authored & Maintained By** : Vishak Arudhra\n\n\n",
