    "description": "Loopy lets you easily generate the tedious, complicated code that is necessary\nto get good performance out of GPUs and multi-core CPUs.\n\nLoopy's core idea is that a computation should be described simply and then\n*transformed* into a version that gets high performance. This transformation\ntakes place under user control, from within Python.\n\nIt can capture the following types of optimizations:\n\n* Vector and multi-core parallelism in the OpenCL/CUDA model\n* Data layout transformations (structure of arrays to array of structures)\n* Loopy Unrolling\n* Loop tiling with efficient handling of boundary cases\n* Prefetching/copy optimizations\n* Instruction level parallelism\n* and many more\n\nLoopy targets array-type computations, such as the following:\n\n* dense linear algebra,\n* convolutions,\n* n-body interactions,\n* PDE solvers, such as finite element, finite difference, and\n  Fast-Multipole-type computations\n\nIt is not (and does not want to be) a general-purpose programming language.\n\nLoopy is licensed under the liberal `MIT license\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_ and free for commercial, academic,\nand private use. To use Loopy, you just need `pyopencl\n<http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl>`_.\n\nPlaces on the web related to Loopy:\n\n* `Python package index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/loo.py>`_ (download releases) Note the extra '.' in the PyPI identifier!\n\n  .. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/loo.py.png\n      :target: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/loo.py\n\n* `Documentation <http://documen.tician.de/loopy>`_ (read how things work)\n* `Github <http://github.com/inducer/loopy>`_ (get latest source code, file bugs)\n* `Wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/Loopy>`_ (read installation tips, get examples, read FAQ)\n* `Homepage <http://mathema.tician.de/software/loopy>`_",
