    "description": "# MEAD Baseline\n\nMEAD Baseline is a library for reproducible deep learning research and fast model\ndevelopment for NLP. The library provides easily extensible abstractions and\nimplementations for data loading, model development, training and export of deep\nlearning architectures. It also provides implementations for high-performance,\ndeep learning models for various NLP tasks, against which newly developed models\ncan be compared. Deep learning experiments are hard to reproduce, Baseline\nprovides functionalities to track them. The goal is to allow a researcher to\nfocus on model development, delegating the repetitive tasks to the library.\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/dpressel/mead-baseline/blob/master/docs/main.md)\n\n[Tutorials using Colab](https://github.com/dpressel/mead-tutorials)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Pip\n\nBaseline can be installed as a Python package.\n\n`pip install mead-baseline`\n\nIf you are using tensorflow 2 as your deep learning backend you will need to have\n`tensorflow_addons` already installed or have it get installed with mead via\n\n`pip install mead-baseline[tf2]`\n\n\n### From the repository\n\nIf you have a clone of this repostory and want to install from it:\n\n```\ncd layers\npip install -e .\ncd ../\npip install -e .\n```\n\nThis first installs `mead-layers` (8 mile) locally and then `mead-baseline`\n\n## A Note About Versions\n\nDeep Learning Frameworks are evolving quickly, and changes are not always\nbackwards compatible. We recommend recent versions of each framework. Baseline\nis known to work on most versions of TensorFlow, and is currently being run on\nversions between 1.13 and 2.1 .\n\nThe PyTorch backend requires at least version 1.3.0.\n\n## Citing\n\nIf you use the library, please cite the following paper:\n\n```\n@InProceedings{W18-2506,\n  author =    \"Pressel, Daniel\n               and Ray Choudhury, Sagnik\n               and Lester, Brian\n               and Zhao, Yanjie\n               and Barta, Matt\",\n  title =     \"Baseline: A Library for Rapid Modeling, Experimentation and\n               Development of Deep Learning Algorithms targeting NLP\",\n  booktitle = \"Proceedings of Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)\",\n  year =      \"2018\",\n  publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n  pages =     \"34--40\",\n  location =  \"Melbourne, Australia\",\n  url =       \"http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-2506\"\n}\n```\n\nMEAD/Baseline was selected for a Spotlight Poster at the NeurIPS MLOSS workshop in 2018.
