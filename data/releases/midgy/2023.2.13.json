    "description": "# `midgy`\n\n`midgy` transforms markdown to python modules and scripts.\n\n### command line interface\n\n```bash\nmidgy README.md     # run a readme file as python\nmidgy run README.md     # run a readme file as python\nmidgy -m README     # run a readme file as python\n```   \n   \n      >>> from midgy.run import Markdown\n      >>> with Markdown():\n      ...   import README\n      >>> print(README)\n      <module 'README' from '...README.md'>\n      \n\n`midgy` is one half of `pidgy`, together they bring literate programming and computing afforandances to [python] and [`IPython`]. `midgy` is only concerned with the half of literate programming that translates a document to compiled code. `midgy` has a small api:\n\n* `md_to_python` - a function that converts a markdown document to python\n* `Python` - a class that parses a markdown document and renders python\n* `midgy.run.Markdown` - is an `importnb` context manager that includes markdown documents when importing python modules.\n\n\n## tangling literate programs\n\n literate programming is paradigm that treats code as literate, and vice versa; documents are evaluated on their literary and computational qualities. there are two actions defined in the framework of literate programming:\n\n1. render\n   : the act of translating the document into a programming language\n   : `midgy` renders markdown to python\n2. weave\n   : the act of translating the document to a rendered format\n   : `pidgy` weaves markdown to html, pdf, or md through the `jinja2` template system.\n\n`midgy` focuses only on the `render` actions, and is extended in `pidgy` which implements the weave action.\n\n### extending the lexical analysis of CommonMark markdown\n\n`midgy` extends the commonmark spec to reflect some common conventions.\n\n1. shebang\n   : `midgy` documents are programs and may begin with a shebang.\n2. front matter\n   : can be included at the beginning of a document or after a shebang.\n   : either toml, json or yaml can be used\n3. doctest\n   : a literate programming convention for including tests in python strings\n4. code\n   : our code blocks are modified to be aware of doctests and include lexical diagnostics of the content\n\n### rendering tokenized CommonMark as Python\n\n`midgy` translates markdown to python relative to indented code blocks. content between indented code blocks are wrapped a python block strings, and non-indented code blocks can be included in python programs. the translation from markdown to python is meant to require the fewest changes to have valid python code.\n\n`midgy` goes to great lengths to generate a line-for-line translation of the markdown to python.\nthe line-for-line translation improves the error handling experience when using non-python documents as modules.\n\n      from sys import argv\n      print(argv)",
