    "description": "###########\nAbout MESMA\n###########\n\nMESMA is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package that implements the MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral\nMixture Analysis) unmixing algorithm in the field of Remote Sensing.\n\nIt is based on VIPER Tools: a software package written for ENVI/IDL and released in 2007.\nSeveral updates have been released since and now it has been ported to PyQGIS in the period 2017 - 2020.\nThe original VIPER Tools is now split over two python/QGIS tools: **Spectral Library Tool** and **MESMA**.\n\n**Spectral Library Tool** provides the following:\n - Creating spectral libraries interactively (selecting spectra from an image or using regions of interest) and managing\n   the metadata (developed by HU Berlin)\n - Optimizing spectral libraries with Iterative Endmember Selection, Ear-Masa-Cob or CRES\n - Website: <https://spectral-libraries.readthedocs.io>\n - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/spectral-libraries\n\n**MESMA** provides the following:\n - Running SMA and MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...)\n - Post-processing of the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, ...)\n - Website: <https://mesma.readthedocs.io>\n - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma\n\nThe software has now been developed in the open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.\n\n**PLEASE GIVE US CREDIT**\n\nWhen using the MESMA tool, please use the following citation:\n\n*Crabbé, A.
