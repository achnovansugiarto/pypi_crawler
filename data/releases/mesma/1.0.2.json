    "description": "About MESMA\n===========\n\nMESMA is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package that implements the MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral\nMixture Analysis) unmixing algorithm in the field of Remote Sensing.\n\nIt is based on VIPER Tools: a software package written for ENVI/IDL and released in 2007.\nSeveral updates have been released since and now it has been ported to PyQGIS in the period 2017 - 2020.\nThe original VIPER Tools is now split over two python/QGIS tools: **Spectral Library Tool** and **MESMA**.\n\n**Spectral Library Tool** provides the following:\n - Creating spectral libraries interactively (selecting spectra from an image or using regions of interest) and managing\n   the metadata (developed by HU Berlin)\n - Optimizing spectral libraries with Iterative Endmember Selection, Ear-Masa-Cob or CRES\n - Website: https://spectral-libraries.readthedocs.io\n - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/spectral-libraries\n\n**MESMA** provides the following:\n - Running SMA and MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...)\n - Post-processing of the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, ...)\n - Website: https://mesma.readthedocs.io\n - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma\n\nThe software has now been developed in the open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.\n\nReferencing the MESMA tool\n==========================\n\nWhen using the MESMA tool, please use the following citation:\n\nCrabbé, A. H., Somers, B., Roberts, D. A., Halligan, K., Dennison, P., Dudley, K. (2019).\nMESMA QGIS Plugin (Version x) [Software]. Available from https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma.\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nThe software and user guide are based on VIPER Tools 2.0 (UC Santa Barbara, VIPER Lab):\nRoberts, D. A., Halligan, K., Dennison, P., Dudley, K., Somers, B., Crabbe, A., 2018, Viper Tools User Manual,\nVersion 2, 91 pp.\n\nMESMA is also using two python packages developed by Benjamin Jakimow and Andreas Rabe:\n - QGISPluginSupport (Benjamin Jakimow, HU Berlin): https://bitbucket.org/jakimowb/qgispluginsupport\n - hub-datacube (Andreas Rabe, HU Berlin): https://bitbucket.org/hu-geomatics/hub-datacube\n\nThis revision is funded primarily through BELSPO (the Belgian Science Policy Office) in the framework\nof the STEREO III Programme – Project LUMOS - SR/01/321.\n\nLogo's were created for free at https://logomakr.com.\n\nSoftware Licence\n================\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General\nPublic License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or any later version.\n\nWhat is new in the Spectral Library Tool 1.0?\n=============================================\n\nDifferences between Viper Tools 2.0 and The Spectral Library Tool 1.0:\n - The migration to PyQGIS is not just a translation from IDL to Python, but also a serious re-write of the code and a\n   revision of the GUI to match the look and feel of other QGIS tools.\n - Library Creation has been revised thoroughly, with integration of GIS: inside QGIS, a spectral library is now\n   represented as a vector layer and each spectrum as a feature. This makes it easier to select spectra from a map,\n   use polygons for selection and manage features and their metadata via the attribute table.\n - Library Creation now also has extra features to import and save spectral libraries (from raster or vector sources,\n   from ASD, CSV, ARTMO, ECOSIS, ENVI en SPECCHIO).\n - The output of the Library Optimization tools has been optimized, breaking backwards compatibility with the IDL tools.\n - The EMC tool also allows for square arrays that have been run in non-reset mode.",
