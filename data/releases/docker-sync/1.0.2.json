    "description": "# docker-sync\n\nHelper utility for configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet.\n\nGiven a directory of config files (see the `example` directory), docker-sync\nwill ensure that the running containers are kept in sync with the config files,\nand will remove containers that no longer have a related config file.\n\nIt's a little bit opinionated: container links aren't supported (tho they could\nbe in the future); all containers are detached.  The image a container is\ninstantiated from is compared to its tag in its appropriate registry, and the\npull is only done if the registry tag is different than the local tag (a `docker\npull` is slow even when there are no changes).\n\nIn the future I may support [dogestry][dogestry] as an alternative (or companion\nto) a traditional Docker registry.\n\n## installation\n\n    pip install docker-sync\n\nOr from a clone:\n\n    pip install .\n\n## example usage\n\n    docker-sync ./example\n\nor\n\n    ./docker_sync/cli.py ./example\n\n## options\n\nYou can add `--no-pull` to skip pulling images; very useful when you're\niterating on your configs.\n\n[dogestry]: https://github.com/blake-education/dogestry",
