    "description": "==========\nDjango Vox\n==========\n\n|pipeline-badge| |coverage-badge| |docs-badge| |pypi-badge|\n\nDjango vox is a django app that allow you to create and issue\ndifferent types of notifications. Notifications can have different\nkinds of parameters which allow for convenient editing in the admin.\n\nFeatures\n---------------\n\n* Add and edit notifications from the admin\n* Built-in message editor provides drop-down of available template variables\n  and supports previewing\n* Supports many backends: email (html & text), SMS (Twilio), Twitter, Slack,\n  Postmark, XMPP, JSON webhooks, and Activity Streams\n* Supports attachments\n* Built in site contacts that can be used to send emails to admins, or update\n  your organization‘s Twitter account, or send out webhooks\n* Flexible API allows you to define your own user preferences about which user\n  gets which kind of notification\n* Set custom “from” addresses\n* Send messages in bulk (all together) or individually customized messages\n\n\nWhy this exists\n---------------\n\nTLDR: Because I am lazy and I don't want to spend my evening doing\na deploy just because marketing wants to update the text in their\nlatest spam mail.\n\nIn a few more words:\n\n* Editing copy for notifications shouldn't have to be done by programmers.\n  This means:\n\n  1. The notification templates should be editable in the admin\n  2. The information necessary to correctly make a template, whether\n     it's a template ID or parameters) should be available in the admin\n     page. It shouldn't be necessary to look through source code just to\n     make a notification work.\n  3. Number 2 is actually a fairly difficult problem.\n\n* People have different ways of interacting with computers, and one\n  way of doing notifications (i.e. email) doesn't always make sense.\n\n  1. Added to that, sending a text message that's as verbose as an HTML\n     email is simply ridiculous. Each medium begets its own kind of\n     content.\n  2. Since, as we mentioned earlier, content should be manageable\n     by non-programmers, the different ways of sending messages should\n     be manageable by non-programmers.\n\n\nI want it, stat!\n----------------\n\nWell, why don't you just head over to `the documentation`_ and we'll\nget you started. A word of warning, it's not super simple to setup, but\nit's worth it.\n\n\n.. |pipeline-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/pipeline.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/\n   :alt: Build Status\n\n.. |coverage-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/coverage.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/\n   :alt: Coverage Status\n\n.. |docs-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/django-vox.svg\n   :target: `the documentation`_\n   :alt: Documentation\n\n.. |pypi-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django_vox.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/django-vox/\n   :alt: Project on PyPI\n\n.. _the documentation: http://django-vox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n3.5.1\n-----\n\n* Fix packaging problem (missing files)\n\n3.5\n---\n\n* Fix some javascript problems on Django 2.1 & 2.2\n* Add one-time message admin actions\n\n3.4\n---\n\n* Fix crash when a non VoxModel model is registered\n\n3.3\n---\n\n* Pin to a newer version of august, it works much better\n* Be slightly more sophisticated with our activity data parsing\n\n3.2\n---\n\n* fix implementation of activity\\_type parameter\n* Fix bug issuing notifications with non VoxModel objects\n* Fix bug where django will crash if ``to_addresses`` is a generator\n* Omit skipping message when notification is not from code\n* Fix bug where we kept recreating notifications\n* Keep orphaned notifications with templates so we don't delete data\n\n3.1\n---\n\n* Add ability to remove notifications of deleted classes\n* Fix error in notification editor when using grappelli\n\n3.0\n---\n\n* Rewrite that add support for multiple participants\n\n2.3\n---\n\n* add ``read_at`` field on inbox items\n* Users should be posting read activities to outbox, duh\n\n2.2\n---\n\n* Add the ability to post to inboxes and read messages\n\n2.1\n---\n\n* Redo activity schema so that its more straightforward\n* fix bug in ``background_task`` implementation\n\n2.0.0\n-----\n\n* Add activity backend\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\n* Replace newlines in subject with space\n* Add support for resending failed messages\n* A few improvements to the admin\n* Add Grappelli compatibility\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\nFirst stable release\n\n",
