    "description": "==========\nDjango Vox\n==========\n\n|pipeline-badge| |coverage-badge| |docs-badge| |pypi-badge|\n\nDjango vox is a django app that allow you to create and issue\ndifferent types of notifications. Notifications can have different\nkinds of parameters which allow for convenient editing in the admin.\n\n\nWhy this exists\n---------------\n\nTLDR: Because I am lazy and I don't want to spend my evening doing\na deploy just because marketing wants to update the text in their\nlatest spam mail.\n\nIn a few more words:\n\n* Editing copy for notifications shouldn't have to be done by programmers.\n  This means:\n\n  1. The notification templates should be editable in the admin\n  2. The information necessary to correctly make a template, whether\n     it's a template ID or parameters) should be available in the admin\n     page. It shouldn't be necessary to look through source code just to\n     make a notification work.\n  3. Number 2 is actually a fairly difficult problem.\n\n* People have different ways of interacting with computers, and one\n  way of doing notifications (i.e. email) doesn't always make sense.\n\n  1. Added to that, sending a text message that's as verbose as an HTML\n     email is simply ridiculous. Each medium begets its own kind of\n     content.\n  2. Since, as we mentioned earlier, content should be manageable\n     by non-programmers, the different ways of sending messages should\n     be manageable by non-programmers.\n\n\nI want it, stat!\n----------------\n\nWell, why don't you just head over to `the documentation`_ and we'll\nget you started. A word of warning, it's not super simple to setup, but\nit's worth it.\n\n\n.. |pipeline-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/pipeline.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/\n   :alt: Build Status\n\n.. |coverage-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/coverage.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/\n   :alt: Coverage Status\n\n.. |docs-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/django-vox.svg\n   :target: `the documentation`_\n   :alt: Documentation\n\n.. |pypi-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django_vox.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/django-vox/\n   :alt: Project on PyPI\n\n.. _the documentation: http://django-vox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n\n",
