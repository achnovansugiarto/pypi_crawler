Sophisticated\n    capabilities are available in the standard library. You can find modules for\n    working with sockets, parsing CSV, JSON, and XML files, and working with\n    files and file paths.\n\n    However great the packages included with Python are, there are many\n    fantastic projects available outside the standard library. These are most\n    often hosted at the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), historically known as the\n    Cheese Shop. At PyPI, you can find everything from Hello World to advanced\n    deep learning libraries.\n\n    [... The full text of the article ...]\n\nYou can also call the Real Python Feed Reader in your own Python code, by importing from the `reader` package:\n\n    >>> from reader import feed\n    >>> feed.get_titles()\n    ['How to Publish an Open-Source Python Package to PyPI', ...]\n\n\n\n",
