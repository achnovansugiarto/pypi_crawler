Django Drips lets you use the admin to manage drip campaign emails using querysets on Django's User model.\n\nThis project is a fork of the one written by [Zapier](https://zapier.com/z/qO/).\n\n#### You can check out the docs [here](https://django-drip-campaigns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Installation:\n\n1. Install django-drip-campaings using pip:\n\n```\npip install django-drip-campaigns\n```\n\n2. Add `'drip'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list on your settings.\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n    'django.contrib.comments',\n    'django.contrib.sessions',\n    'django.contrib.sites',\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n\n    # ...\n\n    'drip',\n]\n```\n\n3. (Optional) Set `DRIP_FROM_EMAIL = '<your_app_from_email>'` in your settings, where `<your_app_from_email>` is the email account that is going to be shown in the sent emails. Otherwise `EMAIL_HOST_USER` value will be used.\n\n4. Finally, run `python manage.py migrate drip` to set up the necessary database tables.\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you haven't, create a superuser with the [Django createsuperuser command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-an-admin-user). Login with the admin user, and select `Drips` to manage them. You will be able to:\n\n- View created drips.\n- Create a new drip.\n- Select and delete drips.\n\n### Create Drip\n\nIn the Django admin, after select `Drips`, you can click on `ADD DRIP +` button to create a new one. You will see the `add drip` page:\n\n![Add Drip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootstrap/django-drip-campaigns/master/docs/images/add_drip_page.png)\n\nOn the `FIELD NAME OF USER` input, when you click on it, you will be able to view:\n\n- The fields of your user's model.\n- The fields of your user's model in other models that are related with it.\n\nPlease take a look a this example:\n\n![Lookup fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootstrap/django-drip-campaigns/master/docs/images/users_lookup_fields.png)\n\nWith this, you can select one or more fields to create useful drips.  \nAdditionally if you select a field name of user that has a date type, you can enter in the `FIELD VALUE` input, a date value written in natural language that combines operations on the current datetime.  \nFor example, if you have selected the field `last_login` that has a date type, and you want to create a drip to send emails to the users who logged in exactly one week ago; you can enter:\n\n```\nnow-1 week\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nnow- 1 w\n```\n\nPossible operations and values:\n\n- Add (`+`) or subtract (`-`) dates.\n- On the left side of the operation, write the current datetime value: `now`.\n- On the right side of the operation:\n  - `seconds` or `s`.\n  - `minutes` or `m`.\n  - `hours` or `h`.\n  - `days` or `d`.\n  - `weeks` or `w`.\n  - If you enter the number `1`, you can write `second`, `minute`, etc.\n  - Don't enter a space between `now` and the operation symbol. Optionally you can add (or not) a space around the number value.\n\nLet's see some examples of the date values that you can enter:\n\n- `now-1 day`\n- `now+ 8days`\n- `now+ 1 h`\n- `now-4hours`\n- `now- 3 weeks`\n- `now-1 weeks`\n\n### View Timeline\n\nIn the Django admin, you can select a drip and then click on the `VIEW TIMELINE` button to view the mails expected to be sent with the corresponding receivers:\n\n![Timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootstrap/django-drip-campaigns/master/docs/images/view_timeline.png)\n\n### Send drips\n\nTo send the created and enabled drips, run the command:\n\n```\npython manage.py send_drips\n```\n\nYou can use cron to schedule the drips.\n\n### The cron scheduler\n\nYou may want to have an easy way to send drips periodically. It's possible to set a couple of parameters in your settings to do that. First activate the scheduler by adding the `DRIP_SCHEDULE_SETTINGS` dictionary:\n\n```python\n# your settings file\nDRIP_SCHEDULE_SETTINGS = {\n   'DRIP_SCHEDULE': True,\n}\n\n```\n\nAfter that, choose:\n\n- A day of the week: An integer value between `0-6`, or a string: `'mon'`, `'tue'`, `'wed'`, `'thu'`, `'fri'`, `'sat'`, `'sun'`. The name in the settings is `DRIP_SCHEDULE_DAY_OF_WEEK` (default is set to `0`).\n- An hour: An integer value between `0-23`. The name in the settings is `DRIP_SCHEDULE_HOUR` (default is set to `0`).\n- A minute: An integer value between `0-59`. The name in the settings is `DRIP_SCHEDULE_MINUTE` (default is set to `0`).\n\nWith those values, a cron scheduler will execute the `send_drips` command every week in the specified day/hour/minute. The scheduler will use the timezone of your `TIME_ZONE` parameter in your settings (default is set to `'UTC'`). For example, if you have:\n\n```python\nDRIP_SCHEDULE_SETTINGS = {\n   'DRIP_SCHEDULE': True,\n   'DRIP_SCHEDULE_DAY_OF_WEEK': 'mon',\n   'DRIP_SCHEDULE_HOUR': 13,\n   'DRIP_SCHEDULE_MINUTE': 57,\n}\n```\n\nThen every Monday at 13:57 the `send_drips` command will be executed.  \nLast but not least, add this line at the end of your main `urls.py` file to start the scheduler:\n\n```python\n# your main urls.py file\n...\nfrom drip.scheduler.cron_scheduler import cron_send_drips\n\n...\ncron_send_drips()\n```\n\nWe recommend you to do it there because we know for sure that it's a file that is executed once at the beginning.\n\nSome tips:\n\n- If you want to run the command every day in the week, hour, or minute, just set the corresponding parameter to `'*'`.\n- If you want to run the command more than a day in the week, just set the `DRIP_SCHEDULE_DAY_OF_WEEK` to more than one value. For example, if you set that to `'mon-fri'` the command will be executed from Monday to Friday.\n",
