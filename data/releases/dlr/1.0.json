    "description": "# DLR\n\nDLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/neo/), [TVM](https://tvm.ai/), or [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). DLR uses the TVM runtime, Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can include other hardware-specific runtimes. DLR provides unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running compiled models on various devices. DLR currently supports platforms from Intel, NVIDIA, and ARM, with support for Xilinx, Cadence, and Qualcomm coming soon.\n\n## Documentation\nFor instructions on installilng DLR, please refer to [Installing DLR](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n\nFor instructions on using DLR, please refer to [Amazon SageMaker Neo – Train Your Machine Learning Models Once, Run Them Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-neo-train-your-machine-learning-models-once-run-them-anywhere/)\n\nAlso check out the [API documentation](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## License\n\nThis library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0. \n\n\n",
