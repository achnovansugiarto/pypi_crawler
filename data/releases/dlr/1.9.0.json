    "description": "# DLR\n\nDLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/neo/), [TVM](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm), or [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). DLR uses the TVM runtime, Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can include other hardware-specific runtimes. DLR provides unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running compiled models on various devices. DLR currently supports platforms from Intel, NVIDIA, and ARM, with support for Xilinx, Cadence, and Qualcomm coming soon.\n\n## Installation\nOn x86_64 CPU targets running Linux, you can install latest release of DLR package via \n\n`pip install dlr`\n\nFor installation of DLR on GPU targets or non-x86 edge devices, please refer to [Releases](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/releases) for prebuilt binaries, or [Installing DLR](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for building DLR from source.\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\n\nimport dlr\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load model.\n# /path/to/model is a directory containing the compiled model artifacts (.so, .params, .json)\nmodel = dlr.DLRModel('/path/to/model', 'cpu', 0)\n\n# Prepare some input data.\nx = np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n# Run inference.\ny = model.run(x)\n\n```\n\n## Release compatibility with different versions of TVM\n\nEach release of DLR is capable of executing models compiled with the same corresponding release of [neo-ai/tvm](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm). For example, if you used the [release-1.2.0 branch of neo-ai/tvm](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm/tree/release-1.2.0) to compile your model, then you should use the [release-1.2.0 branch of neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/release-1.2.0) to execute the compiled model. Please see [DLR Releases](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/releases) for more information.\n\n## Documentation\nFor instructions on using DLR, please refer to [Amazon SageMaker Neo – Train Your Machine Learning Models Once, Run Them Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-neo-train-your-machine-learning-models-once-run-them-anywhere/)\n\nAlso check out the [API documentation](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n### Call Home Feature\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that DLR collects the following metrics to help improve its performance. \nBy default, Amazon will collect and store the following information from your device: \n\n    record_type: <enum, internal record status, such as model_loaded, model_>, \n    arch: <string, platform architecture, eg 64bit>, \n    osname: <string, platform os name, eg. Linux>, \n    uuid: <string, one-way non-identifable hashed mac address, eg. 8fb35b79f7c7aa2f86afbcb231b1ba6e>, \n    dist: <string, distribution of os, eg. Ubuntu 16.04 xenial>, \n    machine: <string, retuns the machine type, eg. x86_64 or i386>, \n    model: <string, one-way non-identifable hashed model name, eg. 36f613e00f707dbe53a64b1d9625ae7d> \n\nIf you wish to opt-out of this data collection feature, please follow the steps below: \n\n    1. Disable through code\n      ``` \n      from dlr.counter.phone_home import PhoneHome\n      PhoneHome.disable_feature()\n      ```\n    2. Or, create a config file, ccm_config.json inside your DLR target directory path, i.e. python3.6/site-packages/dlr/counter/ccm_config.json, then add below format content in it, ```{ \"enable_phone_home\" : false } ``` \n    3. Restart DLR application. \n    4. Validate this feature is disabled by verifying this notification is no longer displayed, or programmatically with following command: \n        ```\n        from dlr.counter.phone_home import PhoneHome \n        PhoneHome.is_enabled() # false if disabled \n        ```\n\n## Examples\nWe prepared several examples demonstrating how to use DLR API on different platforms\n\n* [Neo AI DLR image classification Android example application](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/main/examples/android/image_classification)\n* [DL Model compiler for Android](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/main/examples/android/tvm_compiler)\n* [DL Model compiler for AWS EC2 instances](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/main/container/ec2_compilation_container)\n\n## License\n\nThis library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0. \n\n\n",
