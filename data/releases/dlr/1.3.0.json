    "description": "# DLR\n\nDLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/neo/), [TVM](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm), or [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). DLR uses the TVM runtime, Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can include other hardware-specific runtimes. DLR provides unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running compiled models on various devices. DLR currently supports platforms from Intel, NVIDIA, and ARM, with support for Xilinx, Cadence, and Qualcomm coming soon.\n\n## Installation\nOn x86_64 CPU targets running Linux, you can install latest release of DLR package via \n\n`pip install dlr`\n\nFor installation of DLR on GPU targets, non-x86 edge devices, or building DLR from source, please refer to [Installing DLR](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\n\nimport dlr\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load model.\n# /path/to/model is a directory containing the compiled model artifacts (.so, .params, .json)\nmodel = dlr.DLRModel('/path/to/model', 'cpu', 0)\n\n# Prepare some input data.\nx = np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n# Run inference.\ny = model.run(x)\n\n```\n\n## Release compatibility with different versions of TVM\n\nEach release of DLR is capable of executing models compiled with the same corresponding release of [neo-ai/tvm](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm). For example, if you used the [release-1.2.0 branch of neo-ai/tvm](https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm/tree/release-1.2.0) to compile your model, then you should use the [release-1.2.0 branch of neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/release-1.2.0) to execute the compiled model. Please see [DLR Releases](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/releases) for more information.\n\n## Documentation\nFor instructions on using DLR, please refer to [Amazon SageMaker Neo – Train Your Machine Learning Models Once, Run Them Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-neo-train-your-machine-learning-models-once-run-them-anywhere/)\n\nAlso check out the [API documentation](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## Examples\nWe prepared several examples demonstrating how to use DLR API on different platforms\n\n* [Neo AI DLR image classification Android example application](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/master/examples/android/image_classification)\n* [DL Model compiler for Android](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/master/examples/android/tvm_compiler)\n* [DL Model compiler for AWS EC2 instances](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/tree/master/container/ec2_compilation_container)\n\n## License\n\nThis library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0. \n\n\n",
