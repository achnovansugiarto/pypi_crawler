Lunch automatically resolves to brunch when necessary.\n\n```python console\n>>> m[\"breakfast\"]\n{'sharples': Sharples Dining Hall [Sharples Dining Hall Breakfast {'title': 'Breakfast', 'startdate': '2022-02-14 07:30:00', 'enddate': '2022-02-14 09:30:00', 'short_time': '7:30am - 9:30am', 'description': \"Soup Island: Oatmeal with Raisins, Craisins &amp;
