    "description": "# Saleae Logic 2 Automation\n\n`logic2-automation` implements a Python client for the [Logic 2 Automation API](https://www.saleae.com/automation/).\n\nDocumentation can be found at https://saleae.github.io/logic2-automation/\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 1.0.5\n\n- The .whl build has been fixed, and now includes the generate protobuf/grpc files.\n\n### 1.0.4\n\n- YANKED!\n  - The protobuf files (`saleae/grpc`) generated during the .whl build were not being included in the .whl file. This was caused by the `saleae/grpc` directory being added to the .gitignore file. These ignored files have been moved to the parent directory's .gitignore, and an empty .gitignore has been added to the python directory.\n- Fix boolean analyzer settings not being sent as the correct type.\n\n### 1.0.3\n\n- Updated the README to link out to the docs, and move build instructions to BUILD.md.\n- Updated the install docs.\n\n### 1.0.2\n\n- Update the distribution to only include a source distribution so that gRPC/protobuf files can be generated at install time, and be based on the installed version of grpcio/grpcio-tools/protobuf.\n\n### 1.0.1\n\n- YANKED!\n  - This release was pulled shortly after it was released due to a conflict between the latest gRPC and the generated protobuf files.\n- Change `grpc` & `grpc-tools` dependency to version `>=1.13.0`. This lowers the minimum version, and doesn't stick it to a specific version.\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n- First release\n",
