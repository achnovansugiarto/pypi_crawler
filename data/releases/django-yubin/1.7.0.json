So django-yubin was born\n(yubin is postal mail in japanese). The name attribution is for @morenosan.\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nYubin replaces the standard Django Email Backend with its own. Instead of sending\nthe e-mail trough the SMTP server Yubin stores the e-mails on the database and\nallows you to sent them using a cron command.\n\nAdvantages\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Your application can answer faster, as other process is going to take care of\n  connecting with the SMTP server and sending the e-mail.\n\n* Yubin stores the e-mail and allows you to retrieve using the admin. Even with\n  the attachments.\n\n* Yubin allows to define prioritary queues, resend e-mails\n\n* Yubin helps in your development.  It's a good way to work when you're developping\n  the application and you don't want to flood your test users with\n  e-mails. With Django Yubin, and without running the cron commands, you can see how\n  your e-mails are, retrieve them and even delete them with out sending it.\n\nOn production mode you'll just nedd to add a cron entry in your server to send the e-mails,\nsometing like\n\n    * * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py send_mail >> $PROJECT/cron_mail.log 2>&1)\n\nThis will send the queued e-mail every minute.\n\nDjango Yubin is a fork from django-mailer2 with some addtions from django-mailviews and\nadditional improvements made from apsl.net that we need for our daly basis workd. It\nhas also contributions from other people, so don't heasitate to read the humans.txt.\n\ndjango-mailer-2 by is a Chris Beaven fork from a fork of\nJames Tauber's django-mailer and is a reusable Django app for queuing the sending of email.\n\ndjango-mailviews from Disqus, allows you to compose e-mails using templates in\nthe same way you compose your html templates, and allows you to preview the\ne-mails.\n\nIf you want to run the test you'll need a test smtpd server, you can find one in\n\n    ./bin/fake-server\n\nrun it in a different console and execute `runtests.py`\n\nYou can read the package documentation at http://django-yubin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\nChangelog\n---------\n* 1.7.0       Add optional ``MAILER_MESSAGE_SEARCH_FIELDS`` setting.
