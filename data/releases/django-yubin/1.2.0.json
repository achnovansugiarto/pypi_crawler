    "description": "===============\ndjango_yubin\n===============\n\nDjango Yubin is used to queue e-mails. This allows the emails to be sent\nasynchronously (by the use of a command extension) rather than blocking the\nresponse.\n\nIt also provides with some classes that allows you to compose e-mails in the same way you compose your django\ntemplates, using different templates for subject, body and html content.\n\n.. toctree::\n\n    install\n    queue\n    mailviews\n    settings\n    contributing\n\nIt's a fork!\n=============\n\nYes, it's a fork, fork, comes from django-mailer-2 fork which is a fork form Chris Beaven fork to of James Tauber's\n`django-mailer`__\n\nThis document is readthedocs version of the fork that Chris and James made\nthe original document with some additional information.\n\n.. __: http://github.com/jtauber/django-mailer\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nChris Beaven started a fork of django-mailer and it got to the point when it\nwould be rather difficult to merge back. The fork was then renamed to the\ncompletely unimaginative \"django mailer 2\".\n\nAs always found myself using this project with the mailviews__ classes, we\nadapted some of the mailviews to add priority and some convenience classes.\n\n.. __: https://github.com/disqus/django-mailviews\n\n\nDifferences\n-----------\n\nSome of the larger differences in django_yubin:\n\n* Needs Django 1.5+\n\n* It saves a rendered version of the email instead - so HTML and other\n  attachments are handled fine\n\n* The models were completely refactored for a better logical separation of\n  data.\n\n* It provides a hook to override (aka \"monkey patch\") the Django ``send_mail``,\n  ``mail_admins`` and ``mail_manager`` functions.\n\n* Added a management command to remove old e-mails, so the database does not\n  increase so much.\n\n* Added a new testing procedure, so you can run the tests without having to\n  install and configure a Django application.\n\n* Added some cron templates ein `bin` folder to help you to configure the\n  cron.\n\n* Improved admin configuration.\n\n* Added a demo project, which shows how we can retrieve an email stored in\n  the database and shows django-mailer in the admin.\n\n* Integrated django-mailviews classes\n\n* Added to CI and code coverage.\n\nCredit\n------\n\nAt the time of the fork, the primary authors of django-mailer were James Tauber\nand Brian Rosner. The additional contributors included Michael Trier, Doug\nNapoleone and Jannis Leidel.\n\nOriginal branch and the django-mailer-2 hard work comes from Chris Beaven.\n\ndjango-mailviews from Disqus\n\nThe name django-yubin was suggested by @morenosan, he says it means \"postal mail\" in japanesse, but who knows! :)\n\n\n\n\n",
