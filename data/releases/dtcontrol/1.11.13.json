    "description": "##########################################################################\ndtControl: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms for Controller Representation\n##########################################################################\n\n\n*******************\nSystem requirements\n*******************\n\nTo run dtControl, you need Python 3.6.8 or higher with several other libraries which are automatically installed if installing with the python-based ``pip`` package manager. We have tested the installation and basic functionality on Ubuntu Linux, MacOS Catalina and Windows 10.\n\n\n************************************\nInstalling dtControl on your machine\n************************************\n\nFor most users, running the following command should install the latest version of dtControl, as long as you have Python 3.6.8 or newer and ``pip`` installed on your system::\n\n    $ pip install dtcontrol\n\nNote that in case you have both Python 2 as well as Python 3 installed, you might have to run ``python3 -m pip install dtcontrol``.\n\n\n*******************\nManual Installation\n*******************\n\n*Note: In case of difficulty when following any of the instructions in this section, please check the section 'Common Installation Issues' below*\n\n1. Make sure you have ``python3.6.8`` (or newer) and ``pip3``.\n\n   On Ubuntu 16.10 or newer::\n\n       $ sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip\n\n   On MacOS::\n\n       $ brew install python3\n\n   On Windows, you could, for example install Python 3 and ``pip`` via `Chocolatey <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/>`_.\n2. Use a virtual environment to make sure that the installation is clean and easy, and does not interfere with any other python packages installed in your system. Create a new folder ``dtcontrol`` and create a virtual environment inside it and activate the virtual environment::\n\n       $ mkdir dtcontrol\n       $ cd dtcontrol\n       $ python3 -m venv venv\n       $ source venv/bin/activate\n\n   Run ``python`` and verify that the displayed version is greater than 3.6.8. Press ``Ctrl+D`` to exit the python console again.\n3. With the virtual environment activated, run::\n\n       $ pip install dtcontrol\n\n   This should install *dtControl* and all its dependencies. Try running *dtControl* by typing dtControl in the console. It should print the help text.\n\n\n**Uninstallation** You can delete the ``dtcontrol`` folder created above to delete all traces of dtcontrol as well as its dependencies.\n\n**************************\nCommon Installation Issues\n**************************\n\n1. If ``sudo apt-get install python3.6`` does not work, this `askubuntu answer <https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get)>`_ might help you.\n2. In case of errors when trying to run ``virtualenv``, check that it is located in a directory that is included in your path; this `stackoverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31133050/virtualenv-command-not-found>`_ might be relevant.\n3. If you don't see what went wrong, leave the virtual environment (run \"deactivate\"), delete the folder ``rm -rf ~/dtcontrol-venv`` and go through all the installation steps again. If errors still occur, please `raise an issue <https://gitlab.lrz.de/i7/dtcontrol/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=>`_ or `contact us <https://dtcontrol.model.in.tum.de>`_.\n\n***********************\nRunning the experiments\n***********************\n\nThis section assumes you have installed *dtControl* so that upon entering dtControl in your command line, the help text is displayed. Additionally it assumes that you have unzip-ed all examples in ``./dtcontrol/examples``. If you installed dtControl via ``pip`` and you do not have the examples folder, you can `download dtControl examples <https://gitlab.lrz.de/i7/dtcontrol/-/archive/master/dtcontrol-master.zip?path=examples>`_ and extract them into ``./dtcontrol/examples``.\n\nTo execute a single algorithm on a single model, run a command like::\n\n    $ dtcontrol --input ./dtcontrol/examples/cartpole.scs --use-preset maxfreq --timeout 30m\n\nIf run successfully, this should create a ``benchmark.html`` file displaying the results of the current run. It should also create a ``decision_trees`` folder containing the output (DOT and C files) decision trees.\n\nWe have pre-defined a few preset methods, which can be listed using::\n\n    $ dtcontrol preset --list\n\nRun ``dtcontrol preset --sample`` or see the `manual <https://dtcontrol.readthedocs.io>`_ for details on how to pick and mix your own presets.\n\nOther commands can be found by running::\n\n    $ dtcontrol --help\n\n******************\nReading the output\n******************\n\nTo get an overview of the results, the file ``benchmark.html`` is created in the directory from which you call dtControl.  You can open it in any browser.\n\n\n",
