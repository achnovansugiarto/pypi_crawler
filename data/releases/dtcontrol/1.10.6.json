    "description": "# dtControl: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms for Controller Representation\n\n### System requirements \n\nTo run dtControl, you need Python 3.6.8 or higher with several libraries, namely numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, jinja2 and tqdm. This README explains how to install all of these on a Linux machine.\n\n\n## Installing dtControl on your machine\n\nFor most users, running\n\n```\n$ pip install dtcontrol\n```\n\ninside a new virtual environment (for details, see next section) should install the latest version of dtControl, as long as you have `python >= 3.6.8` and `pip` installed on your system (if not, install python by following the steps in the next section and try again). In case you have both `python2` as well as `python3` installed on your system, you might have to run `python3 -m pip install dtcontrol`.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n*Note: In case of difficulty when following any of the instructions in this section, please check the section 'Common Installation Issues' below*\n\n1. Make sure you have `python3.6.8` (or newer) and `pip3`\n\nUbuntu 16.10 or newer:\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip\n```\n\nMacOS:\n```\n$ brew install python3\n```\n\n2. We use a virtual environment to make sure that the installation is clean and easy, and does not interfere with the python packages installed in your system. Create a new folder `dtcontrol` and create a virtual environment inside it\n\n```\n$ mkdir dtcontrol\n$ cd dtcontrol\n$ python3 -m venv venv\n```\n\nto create a virtual environment for _dtControl_. This will create the folder `venv` inside your `dtcontrol` folder. To uninstall the tool, you can delete this folder and thereby all traces of the python packages you installed for using it.\n\n4. Run \n\n```\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nto enter the virtual environment. Run `python` and check that the displayed version is greater than 3.6.8 (if not, see (3) in the next section). Press Ctrl+D to exit the python console again.\n\n5. With the virtual environment activated, run \n\n```\n$ pip install dtcontrol\n```\n\nThis should install _dtControl_ and all its dependencies. Try running _dtControl_ by typing `dtcontrol` in the console. It should print the help text.\n\n\n### Common Installation Issues\n\n1. If `sudo apt-get install python3.6` does not work, this might help you: https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get.\n2. In case of errors when trying to run `virtualenv`, check that it is located in a directory that is included in your path; this might help you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31133050/virtualenv-command-not-found.\n3. If you don't see what went wrong, leave the virtual environment (run \"deactivate\"), delete the folder `rm -rf ~/dtcontrol-venv` and go through all the installation steps again. If errors still occur, look at section *Fail safe: Virtual machine*.\n\n\n## Running the experiments\n\nThis section assumes you have installed _dtControl_ so that upon entering `dtcontrol` in your command line, the help text is displayed. Additionally it assumes that you have unzip-ed all examples in `./dtcontrol/examples`.\n\nNote that running all experiments may take several hours, or possibly run out of memory. A sensible subset of case studies which run quickly (less than 5 minutes per case study/algorithm combination) is: `cartpole`, `tworooms`, `10rooms` and `vehicle` (vehicle not for the linsvm method).\n\nTo execute a single algorithm on a single model, run a command like\n```\n$ dtcontrol --input ./dtcontrol/examples/cartpole.scs --use-preset maxfreq --timeout 30m\n```\n\nMore information can be found by running\n\n```\n$ dtcontrol --help\n```\n\n\n## Reading the output\n\nTo get an overview of the results, the file `benchmark.html` is created in the directory from which you call `dtcontrol`.  You can open it in any browser.",
