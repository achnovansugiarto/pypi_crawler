    "description": "# Mandrel (python-mandrel) #\n\nMandrel provides bootstrapping and configuration tools for consistent,\nstraightforward project config management.\n\n**Mandrel is a highly idiosyncratic way to organize stuff and is ultimately\ncounterproductive.  The author and maintainer recommends against its continued\nuse.  This project is in maintenance mode only and the author cannot stress\nenough the degree to which alternate approaches to bootstrapping should be\nfound.  Don't use mandrel for new work.  Deprecate its use where you can.\n(FWIW, the author prefers to drive configuration via environment variables,\ngenerally speaking, and only use specialized file-based config with JSON or\nYAML if the configuration needs are especially nuanced.)**\n\nUse Mandrel to:\n\n* bootstrap your python project configuration\n* manage configuration file location/access\n* manage logging configuration and Logger retrieval\n\nSeparate projects can rely on Mandrel for these purposes, and when they're\nbrought together (as eggs, for instance) to a single application, their\nconfiguration can be managed simply in an easily-configurable way.\n\n# License #\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Ethan Rowe <ethan at the-rowes dot com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
