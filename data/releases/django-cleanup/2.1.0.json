    "description": "django-cleanup automatically deletes files for FileField, ImageField, and subclasses. It will delete\nold files when a new file is being saved and it will delete files on model instance deletion.\n\n**Warning! If you use transactions you may lose files if a transaction will rollback at the right\ninstance. Though this outcome is reduced by our use of post_save and post_delete signals, this\noutcome will still occur if there are errors in signals that are handled after our signals are\nhandled. In this case, the old file will be lost and the new file will not be referenced in a model,\nthough the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are concerned about this behavior you\nwill need another solution for old file deletion in your project. This is fixed in Django 1.9+ if\nyou are using a database that supports transactions.**\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n- Support for Django 1.8, 1.11, 2.0\n- Python 2.7 and 3.4+ support\n- Compatible with sorl-thumbnail and easy-thumbnail\n\nHow does it work?\n=================\n\ndjango-cleanup connects post_init, pre_save, post_save, and post_delete signals to signal handlers\nfor each model that has a FileField and which app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS. In order to tell\nwhether or not a FileField's value has changed a local cache of original values is kept on the model\ninstance.\n\nInstallation\n============\n::\n\n    pip install django-cleanup\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAdd django_cleanup to settings.py ::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'django_cleanup',\n    )\n\nSignals\n=======\n\ndjango-cleanup sends the following signals which can be imported from `django_cleanup.signals`:\n\n- **cleanup_pre_delete** just before a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.\n- **cleanup_post_delete** just after a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.\n\nSignals example for sorl.thumbnail\n----------------------------------\n::\n\n    from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete, cleanup_post_delete\n\n    def sorl_delete(**kwargs):\n        from sorl.thumbnail import delete\n        delete(kwargs['file'])\n\n    cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)\n\nRefresh from DB\n===============\nIn Django 1.8, after a call to the method **refresh_from_db**, you will also need to refresh the\ncleanup cache on the instance. This is not required in Django 1.10+.\n::\n\n    from django_cleanup import cleanup\n\n    ...\n\n    instance.refresh_from_db()\n    cleanup.refresh(instance)\n    ...\n\n\nHow to run tests\n================\n::\n\n    tox\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\ndjango-cleanup is free software under terms of the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Ilya Shalyapin, ishalyapin@gmail.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and\nassociated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\nincluding without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial\nportions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
