    "description": "django-cleanup automatically deletes files for :code:`FileField`, :code:`ImageField`, and\nsubclasses. It will delete old files when a new file is being saved and it will delete\nfiles on model instance deletion.\n\n**Warning! If you are using a database that does not support transactions you may lose files if a\ntransaction will rollback at the right instance. Though this outcome is reduced by our use of\npost_save and post_delete signals, this outcome will still occur if there are errors in signals that\nare handled after our signals are handled. In this case, the old file will be lost and the new file\nwill not be referenced in a model, though the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are\nconcerned about this behavior you will need another solution for old file deletion in your project.**\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n- Support for Django 1.11, 2.0, 2.1\n- Python 2.7 and 3.4+ support\n- Compatible with sorl-thumbnail and easy-thumbnail\n\nHow does it work?\n=================\n\ndjango-cleanup connects :code:`post_init`, :code:`pre_save`, :code:`post_save`, and\n:code:`post_delete` signals to signal handlers for each model that has a :code:`FileField` and which\napp is listed in :code:`INSTALLED_APPS`. In order to tell whether or not a :code:`FileField`'s value\nhas changed a local cache of original values is kept on the model instance.\n\nInstallation\n============\n::\n\n    pip install django-cleanup\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAdd django_cleanup to settings.py ::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig',\n    )\n\nSignals\n=======\n\ndjango-cleanup sends the following signals which can be imported from\n:code:`django_cleanup.signals`:\n\n- **cleanup_pre_delete** just before a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.\n- **cleanup_post_delete** just after a file is deleted. Passes a :code:`file` keyword argument.\n\nSignals example for sorl.thumbnail\n----------------------------------\n::\n\n    from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete, cleanup_post_delete\n\n    def sorl_delete(**kwargs):\n        from sorl.thumbnail import delete\n        delete(kwargs['file'])\n\n    cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)\n\nRefresh the cache\n=================\nRefresh the cleanup cache on the instance.\n::\n\n    from django_cleanup import cleanup\n\n    ...\n\n    cleanup.refresh(instance)\n    ...\n\n\nHow to run tests\n================\n::\n\n    tox\n\nHow to write tests\n==================\nThis library requires the use of django.test.TransactionTestCase_ when writing tests.\n\nFor details on why this is required see\n`here <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/transactions/#use-in-tests>`_:\n\n    Djangoâ€™s :code:`TestCase` class wraps each test in a transaction and rolls back that transaction\n    after each test, in order to provide test isolation. This means that no transaction is ever\n    actually committed, thus your :code:`on_commit()` callbacks will never be run. If you need to\n    test the results of an :code:`on_commit()` callback, use a :code:`TransactionTestCase` instead.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\ndjango-cleanup is free software under terms of the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Ilya Shalyapin, ishalyapin@gmail.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and\nassociated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\nincluding without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial\nportions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
