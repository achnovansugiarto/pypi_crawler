The student can click through two states of the XBlock,\nshown below:\n\n| |mark|\n| |undo|\n\n.. |mark| image:: completionxblock_mark.png\n.. |undo| image:: completionxblock_undo.png\n\nThis can be useful for activities that are self directed or where completion is ambiguous.\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\nYou can see the DoneXBlock in action in the XBlock Workbench.  Running the Workbench requires having docker running.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t  git clone git@github.com:openedx/DoneXBlock\n\t  virtualenv venv/DoneXBlock/\n\t  source venv/DoneXBlock/activate\n\t  make upgrade\n\t  make install\n\t  make dev.run\n\nYou can interact with the DoneXBlock in the Workbench by navigating to http://localhost:8000\n\nFor details regarding how to deploy this or any other XBlock in the lms instance, see the `installing-the-xblock`_ documentation.\n\n.. _installing-the-xblock: https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/edx_platform/devstack.html#installing-the-xblock\n\nGetting Help\n============\n\nIf you're having trouble, we have discussion forums at\nhttps://discuss.openedx.org where you can connect with others in the\ncommunity.\n\nOur real-time conversations are on Slack. You can request a `Slack\ninvitation`_, then join our `community Slack workspace`_.\n\nFor anything non-trivial, the best path is to open an issue in this\nrepository with as many details about the issue you are facing as you\ncan provide.\n\nhttps://github.com/openedx/DoneXBlock/issues\n\nFor more information about these options, see the `Getting Help`_ page.\n\n.. _Slack invitation: https://openedx.org/slack\n.. _community Slack workspace: https://openedx.slack.com/\n.. _Getting Help: https://openedx.org/getting-help\n\nHow to Contribute\n=================\n\nDetails about how to become a contributor to the Open edX project may\nbe found in the wiki at `How to contribute`_\n\n.. _How to contribute: https://openedx.org/r/how-to-contribute\n\nThe Open edX Code of Conduct\n----------------------------\n\nAll community members should familarize themselves with the `Open edX Code of Conduct`_.\n\n.. _Open edX Code of Conduct: https://openedx.org/code-of-conduct/\n\nPeople\n======\n\nThe assigned maintainers for this component and other project details\nmay be found in `Backstage`_ or groked from inspecting catalog-info.yaml.\n\n.. _Backstage: https://open-edx-backstage.herokuapp.com/catalog/default/component/DoneXBlock\n\nReporting Security Issues\n=========================\n\nPlease do not report security issues in public. Please email security@edx.org.\n\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nFutureLearn uses this kind of thing to great effect. Students can read\ntext, watch videos, etc., and indicate when their done. This is\nconvenient both for progress indication to the student (know what\nthey've done, and for honor code grading (indicating to us that they\nbelieve they've finished an activity).\n\nI copied some of the UX patterns from FutureLearn so that users of\nboth platforms would have consistency of user experience between\nMOOCs. I didn't copy them exactly since I wanted to be unambiguously \nin the clear with IP issues around look-and-feel, and this was on a short\nanough timeline that I did not have a chance to reach out to\nFutureLearn for permission. As a footnote, this kind of collaboration\nbetween MOOC providers is probably worth pursuing -- it'd be to the\nbenefit of learners on all platforms, and ultimately, the industry as\na whole if we had consistency of experience between platforms where\nconvenient.\n\n\n",
