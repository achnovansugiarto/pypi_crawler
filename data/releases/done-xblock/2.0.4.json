    "description": "DoneXBlock\n==============\n\nLets a student mark they've finished an activity. The student can\nclick through two states of the XBlock, shown below:\n\n![Done screenshot](completionxblock_mark.png)\n\n![Done screenshot](completionxblock_undo.png)\n\nFutureLearn uses this kind of thing to great effect. Students can read\ntext, watch videos, etc., and indicate when their done. This is\nconvenient both for progress indication to the student (know what\nthey've done, and for honor code grading (indicating to us that they\nbelieve they've finished an activity).\n\nI copied some of the UX patterns from FutureLearn so that users of\nboth platforms would have consistency of user experience between\nMOOCs. I didn't copy them exactly since I wanted to be unambiguously \nin the clear with IP issues around look-and-feel, and this was on a short\nanough timeline that I did not have a chance to reach out to\nFutureLearn for permission. As a footnote, this kind of collaboration\nbetween MOOC providers is probably worth pursuing -- it'd be to the\nbenefit of learners on all platforms, and ultimately, the industry as\na whole if we had consistency of experience between platforms where\nconvenient.\n\n\n",
