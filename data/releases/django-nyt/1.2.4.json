Something happened\"), EVENT_KEY)\n\nAll users subscribing to ``\"my_key\"`` will have a notification created\nin their stack when ``notify()`` is called.\n\nIf you have emails enabled, subscribers receive a summary of notifications at\nan interval of their choice.\n\nData can be accessed easily from Django models or from the included JSON\nviews.\n\nChannels (django-channels)\n--------------------------\n\nStarting from django-nyt 1.0, support for the upcoming\n`channels <https://channels.readthedocs.io/>`_ has been added together with\nDjango 1.9 and 1.10 support.\n\nIn order to install the prerelease, use an extra flag for pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install django-nyt --pre\n\n\nDocs\n----\n\nhttps://django-nyt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\nWhy should you do this?\n-----------------------\n\nUsers need a cleverly sifted stream of events that's highly customizable\nas well. By using django-nyt, your users can subscribe to global events\nor specific events pertaining specific objects.\n\nInstead of inventing your own notification system, use this and you won't have\nto design your own models, and you will have a nice guide that goes through\nthe various steps of implementing notifications for your project.\n\nLet's try to summarize the reasons you want to be using django-nyt:\n\n - Simple API: call ``notify()`` where-ever you want.\n - CLI for sending emails (as cron job, daemon or Celery task)\n - Support for django-channels and Web Sockets (optional, fallback for JSON-based polling)\n - Basic JavaScript / HTML example code\n - Multi-lingual\n - Individual subscription settings for each type of event, for instance:\n   - Event type A spawns instant email notifications, but Event B only gets emailed weekly.\n - Customizable intervals for which users can receive notifications\n - Optional URL for action target for each notification\n - Avoid clutter: Notifications don't get repeated, instead a counter is incremented.\n\nThis project exists with ``django.contrib.messages`` in mind, to serve a simple,\nbest-practice, scalable solution for notifications. There are loads of other\nnotification apps for Django, some focus on integration of specific communication\nprotocols\n\nWhat do you need to do?\n-----------------------\n\ndjango-nyt does everything it can to meet as many needs as possible and\nhave sane defaults.\n\nBut you need to do a lot! Firstly, you need to write some JavaScript that will\nfetch the latest notifications and display them in some area of the\nscreen. Upon clicking that icon, the latest notifications are displayed, and\nclicking an individual notification will redirect the user through a page\nthat marks the notification as read.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/django-wiki/django-nyt/master/docs/misc/screenshot_dropdown.png\n   :alt: Javascript drop-down\n\nJavaScript drop-down: Some examples are provided in the docs, but there\nis no real easy way to place this nifty little thing at the top of your\nsite, you're going to have to work it out on your own.\n\nOther items for your TODO list:\n\n-  Provide your users with options to customize their subscriptions and\n   notification preferences. Create your own ``Form`` inheriting from\n   ``django_nyt.forms.SettingsForm``.\n-  Customize contents of notification emails by overwriting templates in\n   ``django_nyt/emails/notification_email_message.txt`` and\n   ``django_nyt/emails/notification_email_subject.txt``.\n-  Make the mail notification daemon script run either constantly\n   ``python manage.py notifymail --daemon`` or with some interval by invoking\n   ``python manage.py notifymail --cron`` as a cronjob. You can also call it\n   from a Celery task or similar with ``call_command('notifymail', cron=True)``.\n\n\nDevelopment / demo project\n--------------------------\n\nIn your Git fork, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install the\nrequirements.\n\nInstall pre-commit hooks to verify your commits::\n\n    pip install pre-commit\n    pre-commit install\n\nThe folder **test-project/** contains a pre-configured django project and\nan SQlite database. Login for django admin is *admin:admin*::\n\n    cd test-project\n    python manage.py runserver\n\nAfter this, navigate to `http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_\n\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nPlease visit #django-wiki on irc.freenode.net as many django-wiki users\nare also familiar with django-nyt which previously lived inside\ndjango-wiki.\n\n\n",
