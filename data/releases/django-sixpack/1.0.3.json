    "description": "django-sixpack\n==============\n\n``django-sixpack`` is a Django-friendly wrapper for the `sixpack-py <https://github.com/seatgeek/sixpack-py>`_ \nclient library to `SeatGeek <https://github.com/seatgeek/>`_'s `Sixpack <https://github.com/seatgeek/sixpack>`_,\na language-agnostic A/B testing framework.\n\nThis is not a full-fledged client (it relies on ``sixpack-py`` for the actual connection); it's a wrapper\nto make using ``sixpack-py`` more friendly and declarative.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install djsixpack\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nSet ``SIXPACK_HOST`` and (optionally) ``SIXPACK_TIMEOUT`` in your settings file. \n\nIf ``SIXPACK_HOST`` is unset, it will fall back to ``sixpack-py``'s default, which is ``http://localhost:5000``. If ``SIXPACK_HOST`` is set to ``None``, ``django-sixpack`` will\noperate in test mode, which means that the control alternative (the first one listed) will be\nreturned for all ``participate`` calls, all ``convert`` calls will be successful, and the exertnal\nsixpack server will not be contacted.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFirst, define a test somewhere:\n\n.. code:: python\n   \n   from djsixpack.djsixpack import SixpackTest\n   \n   class ButtonColorTest(SixpackTest):\n      alternatives = (\n         'RED',\n         'BLUE'\n      )\n      \nIf you go into the Sixpack web dashboard, you'll see this as a test called ``button_color``, with \nthe control being the alternative ``RED`` (the first alternative listed will be considered the control).\n\nWhen it's time to add a user to the test:\n\n.. code:: python\n   \n   expt = ButtonColorTest(request.user)\n   bucket = expt.participate()\n   \n   context = {}\n   if bucket == ButtonColorTest.RED:\n      context = {'color': '#FF0000'}\n   elif bucket == ButtonColorTest.BLUE:\n      context = {'color': '#0000FF'}\n      \n``SixpackTest.participate`` will return the alternative ``request.user`` is bucketed into - and all alternatives\nwill be available as class properties. \n\nWhen instantiating a ``SixpackTest`` test, the only argument the constructor takes is the model instance\nwhich is used to represent the person seeing this test. By default, ``SixpackTest`` will use the instance's\n``pk`` attribute as the unique identifier to represent this person - but this can be overridden by setting the\n``unique_attr`` class attribute.\n\nFor example, you could have a ``Business`` model class which represents a person, and it has a attribute called \n``global_id`` which represents a cross-platform way of identifying a particular ``Business``. In that case, \nyou could do:\n\n.. code:: python\n   \n   from djsixpack.djsixpack import SixpackTest\n   \n   class ButtonColorTest(SixpackTest):\n      unique_attr = 'global_id'\n      alternatives = (\n         'RED',\n         'BLUE'\n      )\n\nAt any point, you can check the ``SixpackTest.client_id`` property to see what's being used as the ``client_id``.\n\nIf something ever goes wrong - a request times out, the ``sixpack`` server disappears, etc. - all ``participate`` \ncalls will return the control alternative, and all ``convert`` calls will seem successful (and we'll note this happend\nin the log).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n``django-sixpack`` is released under the MIT license.\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug\n- Fork the repository on GitHub to start making your changes to the master branch (or branch off of it)\n- Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published\n- Add yourself to the ``AUTHORS`` file\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\n- `SeatGeek <https://github.com/seatgeek/>`_, for being great",
