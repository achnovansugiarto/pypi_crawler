    "description": "Droit is a simple library for creating bots - [view on GitHub](https://github.com/jarinox/python-droit)  \n\n## Features\n- Advanced definition of question-to-answer rules using Droit Database Script\n- Multiple users supported\n- Integrated history functionallity to understand references to previous inputs\n- Extendable: create your own sub-rules (\"plugins\")\n\n## Learn\n- [Wiki > Introduction to Droit v1.1](https://github.com/jarinox/python-droit/wiki/Introduction-to-Droit-v1.1)\n- [Documentation](https://github.com/jarinox/python-droit/blob/master/docs/droit.md)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/jarinox/python-droit/blob/master/sample/)\n\n\n## What's new about Droit v1.1?\n### 1. Database object\nA new object called `Database` will be now the core of python-droit. It combines the functionallity of `__init__.py`, `tools.py`, `loader.py` and `dumper.py` from Droit v1.0. You can use it to parse and dump a Database, you can load plugins into it and run `useRules()` and `formatOut()` from it. It replaces `rpack` as it also stores `cache` and `history` objects. The `settings` object was removed and replaced by so called sessions.\n\n### 2. Plugins\nRestructuring droit of caurse has an effect on the plugins. There are minimal adjustments that have to be done to make v1.0 plugins work with v1.1. The biggest change is that there are now two types of output plugins. On the one hand there are still those that are called using `EVAL`. The folder they are stored in is from now on called `eval.pluginName`. The new type of output plugins is similar to input plugins. Those plugins use a `block()` function. The `TEXT` and `VAR` blocks are no longer part of the core source code but plugins. Another new feature of plugins are so called \"requirements\". Each plugin can register function that to be used by other plugins.\n\n### 3. DroitIO\nDroitIO will be removed as it is the task of the person who writes the bot to implement a solution for input and output.There is now a ready-to-use telegram bot called [telepyd](https://github.com/jarinox/telepyd).  \n\n### 4. Sessions\nDroit v1.1 is the first version to support multiple users. Therefore so called sessions can be created. The `Database` object stores a `DroitMultiSession` object in it's parameter `sessions`. Using this object you can load and save sessions and switch between users. Plugins can access sessions and store data separately for each user.\n\n## License\nThis library is published under the terms of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
