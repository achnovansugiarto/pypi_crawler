    "description": "> DocOnce is a modestly tagged (Markdown-like) markup language targeting scientific reports, software documentation, books, blog posts, and slides involving much math and code in the text. From DocOnce source you can generate LaTeX, Sphinx, HTML, IPython notebooks, Markdown, MediaWiki, and other formats. This means that you from a single source can get the most up-to-date publishing technologies for paper, tablets, and phones.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n * Tutorial: [Sphinx](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/html/index.html),\n   [HTML](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/tutorial.html),\n   [PDF](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/tutorial.pdf)\n * Manual: [Sphinx](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/index.html),\n   [HTML](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html),\n   [PDF](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.pdf)\n * Quick Reference: [Sphinx](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quickref/html/index.html),\n   [HTML](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quickref/quickref.html),\n   [PDF](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quickref/quickref.pdf)\n * Troubleshooting and FAQ: [Sphinx](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/trouble/html/index.html),\n   [HTML](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/trouble/trouble.html),\n   [PDF](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/trouble/trouble.pdf)\n\nThe tutorial presents the basic syntax and the most fundamental\nelements of a scientific document, while the manual has accumulated\nall the different features available. The most efficient way to get\nstarted is to look at the [report demo](http://doconce.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/index.html) and study\nthe [source code](http://doconce.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.do.txt.html)\n(it has all the basic elements such as title, author, abstract, table\nof contents, headings, comments, inline mathematical formulas,\nsingle/multiple equations, with and without numbering, labels,\ncross-references to sections and equations, bullet lists, enumerated\nlists, copying of computer code from files, inline computer code,\nindex entries, figures, tables, and admonitions).\n\n\n### Installation\n\nDocOnce is a Python 3 package that can be installed with `pip` or `conda`. This procedure installs a minimal number of dependencies. \n\n##### Preliminary steps\n* The `python -V` and `pip -V` commands should refer to Python 3.x. If that is not the case, you might want to use the `pip3` and `python3` commands in the following instructions.\n\n##### Installation using pip\n\nInstall DocOnce and its dependencies:\n\n```\npip install DocOnce --user\n```\n\n##### Installation using conda\n\nCreate a conda environment with `pip`:\n```\nconda create --name doconce python=3\nconda activate doconce\nconda install pip\n```\n\nInstall DocOnce:\n```\npip install DocOnce\n```\n\n##### Installation in a Python virtual environment\n\nA Python virtual environment is an isolated environment for python projects, which makes this option the safest installation. \n\nCreate a virtual environment:\n```\npython -m venv venv\n. venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nInstall DocOnce:\n```\npip install DocOnce\n```\n\n##### Comprehensive installation\n\nFor carrying out a comprehensive installation clone this repository \non the local computer and run `pip install` in that directory:\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:doconce/doconce.git\ncd doconce\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nAlso refer to the [manual](https://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html#install:doconce) to upgrade your DocOnce software to the latest update.\n\n\n### Highlights\n\n * DocOnce is a modestly tagged markup language (see [syntax example](http://doconce.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.do.txt.html)), quite like Markdown, but with many more features, aimed at documents with\n   *much math and code in the text* (see [demo](http://doconce.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/index.html)).\n * There is extensive support for book projects. In addition to classical LaTeX-based paper books one gets for free fully responsive, modern-looking, HTML-based ebooks for tablets and phones. Parts of books can, e.g., appear in blog posts for discussion and as IPython notebooks for experimentation and annotation.\n * For documents with math and code, you can generate *clean* plain LaTeX (PDF), HTML (with MathJax and Pygments - embedded in your own templates), Sphinx for attractive web design, Markdown, IPython notebooks, HTML for Google or Wordpress blog posts, and MediaWiki. The LaTeX output has many fancy layouts for typesetting of computer code.\n * DocOnce can also output other formats (though without support for nicely typeset math and code): plain untagged text, Google wiki, Creole wiki, and reStructuredText. From Markdown or reStructuredText you can go to XML, DocBook, epub, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, MS Word, and other formats.\n * The document source is first preprocessed by Preprocess and Mako, which gives you full programming capabilities in the document's text. For example, with Mako it is easy to write a book with all computer code examples in two alternative languages (say Matlab and Python), and you can determine the language at compile time of the document. New user-specific features of DocOnce can also be implemented via Mako.\n * DocOnce extends Sphinx, Markdown, and MediaWiki output such that LaTeX align environments with labels work for systems of equations. DocOnce also adjusts Sphinx and HTML code such that it is possible to refer to equations outside the current web page.\n * DocOnce makes it very easy to write slides with math and code by stripping down running text in a report or book. LaTeX Beamer slides, HTML5 slides (reveal.js, deck.js, dzslides), and Remark (Markdown) slides are supported. Slide elements can be arranged in a grid of cells to easily control the layout.\n\nDocOnce looks similar to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Pandoc-extended\nMarkdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), and in particular\n[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/).  The main\nadvantage of DocOnce is the richer support for writing large documents\n(books) with much math and code and with\ntailored output both in HTML and\nLaTeX. DocOnce also has special support for exercises, [quizzes](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quiz/quiz.html), and [admonitions](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/._manual017.html#___sec55),\nthree very desired features when developing educational material.\nBooks can be composed of many smaller documents that may exist\nindependently of the book, thus lowering the barrier of writing books\n(see [example](https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce)).\n\n\n\n### News\n\nHere are some of the most recent features and enhancements in DocOnce:\n * October 2020: DocOnce can now produce content files for [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). \n * July 2020: Alessandro Marin at the [Centre for Computing in Science Education](http://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/) at the University of Oslo, assumes the role of developer and principal maintainer.\n * On 10 October 2016, Hans Petter Langtangen, creator of DocOnce, [passed away](https://www.simula.no/news/hans-petter-langtangen-1962-2016). Kristian Gregorius Hustad, supported by the [Centre for Computing in Science Education](http://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/) at the University of Oslo, will assume the role of principal maintainer.\n\nHere are some recent books written in DocOnce:\n\n<!-- <img src=\"doc/src/manual/fig/doconce_books.jpg\" width=600> -->\n![](doc/src/manual/fig/doconce_books.jpg)\n\n### Installation\n\nDocOnce is a pure Python package and can be installed with `pip`.\n\n\n```\nTerminal> pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/doconce/preprocess\nTerminal> pip install --upgrade .\n```\n\n*Notice.* \nIf you first installed DocOnce prior to February 2017, you must remove the old installation before upgrading. See instructions in [issue #110](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/issues/110).\n\n\nHowever, DocOnce has *a lot* of dependencies, depending on what type of\nformats you want to work with and how advanced constructions that are\nused in the text.\n\nWith Anaconda it is trivial to install DocOnce and all dependencies by\n\n```\nTerminal> conda config --add channels conda-forge\nTerminal> conda install doconce\n```\n\n*Warning.* \nAs of March 2017, a few dependencies have yet to be added to the `conda-forge` channel, but most formats should work fine.\n\n\n\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu it is fairly straightforward to get the packages you need. You can run a \n[Python script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doconce/doconce/master/doc/src/manual/install_doconce.py) or an equivalent [Bash script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doconce/doconce/master/doc/src/manual/install_doconce.sh). \nSuch a script installs a very comprehensive bundle of software. You can read the [Installation Guide](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies) to get a more\ndetailed description of what is needed of software for various purposes.\nFor HTML output, for example, you can usually get away with just installing\nthe pure DocOnce source (and perhaps the preprocessors if you use them).\n\n\n### Demo\n\nA [short scientific report](http://doconce.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/index.html)\ndemonstrates the many formats that DocOnce can generate and how\nmathematics and computer code look like. (Note that at the bottom of\nthe page there is a link to another version of the demo with complete\nDocOnce commands for producing the different versions.)\n\n<!-- Note: local links does not work since this README file is a source -->\n<!-- code file and not part of the published gh-pages. Use full URL. -->\n\nAnother demo shows how DocOnce can be used to [create slides](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/slides/demo/index.html) in\nvarious formats (HTML5 reveal.js, deck.js, etc., as well as LaTeX\nBeamer).\n\nDocOnce has support for *responsive* HTML documents with design and\nfunctionality based on Bootstrap styles.  A [Bootstrap demo](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/bootstrap/index.html)\nillustrates the many possibilities for colors and layouts.\n\nDocOnce also has support for exercises in [quiz format](http://doconce.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quiz/quiz.html). Pure quiz files can be *automatically uploaded* to \n[Kahoot!](https://getkahoot.com) online quiz games operated through smart\nphones (with the aid of [quiztools](https://github.com/doconce/quiztools) \nfor DocOnce to Kahoot! translation).\n\n\n\nSeveral books (up to over 1000 pages) have been written entirely in\nDocOnce. The primary format is a publisher-specific LaTeX style, but\nHTML or Sphinx formats can easily be generated, such as [this chapter\nin Bootstrap style](http://doconce.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/looplist/looplist-bootstrap.html),\nor the [solarized color style](http://doconce.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/looplist/looplist-solarized.html)\nas many prefer. Slides can quickly be generated from the raw text in\nthe book.  Here are examples in the [reveal.js](http://doconce.github.io/scipro-primer/slides/looplist/html/looplist-reveal-beige.html)\n(HTML5) style, or the more traditional [LaTeX Beamer](http://doconce.github.io/scipro-primer/slides/looplist/pdf/looplist-beamer.pdf)\nstyle, and even the modern [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/hplgit.github.io/scipro-primer/slides/looplist/ipynb/looplist.ipynb)\ntool, which allows for interactive experimentation and annotation.\n\n\n### License\n\nDocOnce is licensed under the BSD license, see the included `LICENSE` file.\n\n### Authors\n\nDocOnce was originally written by Hans Petter Langtangen at [hpl@simula.no](mailto:hpl@simula.no) in 2006-2016. Alessandro Marin ([email address](mailto:alessandro.marin@fys.uio.no)) has assumed in 2020 the role of developer and principal maintainer. A lot of people have contributed to testing the software and suggesting improvements. \n\n\n### How to cite\n\n#### Link in the copyright\n\nThe command-line option `--cite_doconce` can be used\nto equip the copyright field with a link to the present page.\nHere is an example involving some document `mydoc.do.txt`:\n\n\n```\nTITLE: Some document\nAUTHOR: Joe Doe\n...\n```\n\nCompile to HTML with DocOnce link:\n\n\n```\nTerminal> doconce format html mydoc --cite_doconce\n```\n\nThe footer of the first page will now contain \"Made with DocOnce\".\n\n#### Traditional citation in a bibliography\n\nBibTeX format:\n\n\n```\n@misc{DocOnce,\n  title = {{DocOnce} markup language},\n  author = {H. P. Langtangen},\n  url = {https://github.com/doconce/doconce},\n  key = {DocOnce},\n  note = {\\url{https://github.com/doconce/doconce}},\n}\n```\n\nPublish format:\n\n\n```\n* misc\n** {DocOnce} markup language\n   key:       DocOnce\n   author:    H. P. Langtangen\n   url:       https://github.com/doconce/doconce\n   status:    published\n   sortkey:   DocOnce\n   note:      \\url{https://github.com/doconce/doconce}\n```\n\n\n\n",
