    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\ndjango-ucamlookup is a library which provides useful methods and\ntemplates to integrate your `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__\napplication with the University of Cambridge University `Lookup\nservice <https://www.lookup.cam.ac.uk/>`__.\n\nUse\n---\n\nInstall django-ucamlookup using pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install django-ucamlookup\n\nAdd django-ucamlookup to your installed applications in your project\nconfiguration settings.py:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        INSTALLED_APPS=(\n        ...\n            'ucamlookup', \n        ...\n        ),\n\nand the urls entries in the urls.py file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        urlpatterns = patterns(\n        ...\n            # lookup/ibis urls\n            url(r'^ucamlookup/', include('ucamlookup.urls')),\n        ...\n        )\n\nRequirements and warning\n------------------------\n\nThis module will only work inside the University of Cambridge network.\nMake sure your users are authenticated as University of Cambridge users\n(you can use the django-ucamwebauth module) or you will be exposing\npersonal data to non authorised users.\n\nLookup User\n-----------\n\ndjango-ucamlookup modifies a User object each time is going to be saved,\neither new or update, and assigns to its *last\\_name* property the\nvisible name from lookup for that user. The username is used to search\nfor this user in lookup.\n\nLookup Group\n------------\n\ndjango-ucamlookup includes a new model called LookupGroup that it is\nused to cache lookup models. It is used to store the lookup group id and\nits name, and therefore used to reduce the number of call to the lookup\nservice. It can also be used to create relation with other models. For\nexample, let's say we have a model called Secret and we only want to let\naccess to it to users inside a certain group or groups. We will create a\nManyToMany relation from Secrets to LookupGroup.\n\nThe name of the group is retrieve from the lookup service each time the\ngroup is saved (new or updated). The name is stored in the *name*\nproperty of the class and the id of the lookup group is stored in\n*lookup\\_id*.\n\nIt is important to say that this model is not used to cache relations\nbetween lookup users and lookup groups. These relations are always\nqueried to the live lookup service. The model is only used to let the\ndeveloper make relations between models that include lookup groups and\ncache the name of the group.\n\nTemplate macros\n---------------\n\nTwo macros are available to be used in a template: ucamlookup\\_users,\nand ucamlookup\\_groups. These macros have javascript functions that will\nmodify a html input tag to an interactive ajax box with interaction to\nthe lookup service that will let the user use autocomplete and search\nfor lookup users and groups.\n\nIf you want to include an input box to let the user search and introduce\na single user or a list of users, use the ucamlookup\\_users macro. You\nshould pass as parameters to the macro the html input tag *id* that you\nwant to modify/use and if you want to let the user select one or more\nusers with the parameter *multiple*:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        {% include 'ucamlookup_users.html' with input_tag_id=\"lookup_users\" multiple=true user_list=\"authors\" %}\n\nIf you want to show existing records in the input tag you will need to\npass to the view the list of crsids. This list needs to be passed inside\na dictionary called *loockup\\_lists*. The key entry name of the\ndictionary where the list is located it is passed to the macro using the\nvariable *user\\_list* as shown previously. In this example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        lookup_lists = {\n            'authors': post.users.all(),\n        }\n\nYou will also have to include the following macro in the head of your\ntemplate to load the js and css files associated. These macros require\njquery if you want to include your own jquery library or you are already\nusing it in your template use the parameter *jquery* to specify it.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        {% include 'ucamlookup_headers.html' with jquery=True %}\n\nAnd your input tag will be transform into an ajax box that allows the\nuser to search for users using lookup either using their username or\ntheir complete name. A list of crsids will be sent as the value of the\ninput tag.\n\nThe same will work for lookup groups, just substitute user by group in\nthe id and in the include.\n\nAdmin interface\n---------------\n\nThe admin interface is tunned to add managing options for the\nLookupGroup model. The *add* option will show the same\najax-lookup-integrated-input as the template macros described above.\n\nIt also changes the add form for the user and it also shows an\ninteractive ajax lookup-integrated input form when the admin wants to\nadd a new user to the app.\n\nThese input forms allow to search for name and crsid in the case of a\nnew user and for name in the case of a lookup group.\n\nAvailable functions\n-------------------\n\nThe module also provides some useful functions to use in your app that\ndo all the calls to the lookup service needed.\n\n*get\\_group\\_ids\\_of\\_a\\_user\\_in\\_lookup(user)*: Returns the list of\ngroup ids of a user\n\n*user\\_in\\_groups(user, lookup\\_groups)*: Check in the lookup webservice\nif the user is member of any of the groups in the LookupGroup list\npassed by parameter. Returns True if the user is in any of the groups or\nFalse otherwise\n\n*def get\\_institutions(user=None)*: Returns the list of institutions\nusing the lookup ucam service. The institutions of the user passed by\nparameters will be shown first in the list returned\n\n*validate\\_crsids(crsids\\_text)*: It receives a list of crsids (comming\nfrom input tag from the template macros described previously) [wich\nformat is separated by commas and with no spaces in between] and returns\na list of Users corresponding to the crsids passed.\n\n*get\\_or\\_create\\_user\\_by\\_crsid(crsid)*: Returns the User\ncorresponding to the crsid passed. If it does not exists in the\ndatabase, it is created.\n\n*get\\_institution\\_name\\_by\\_id(institution\\_id,\nall\\_institutions=None)*: Returns the name of an institution by the id\npassed. If all\\_institutions is passed (the result from\nget\\_institutions) then the search is done locally using this list\ninstead of a lookup call.\n\nThe last two methods can be used to add institutions to a model and show\nthe name instead of the code in the admin interface\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n        all_institutions = get_institutions()\n        \n        model = MyModel\n        list_display = ('institution', )\n        list_filter = ('institution_id', )\n\n        def institution(self, obj):\n            return get_institution_name_by_id(obj.institution_id, self.all_institutions)\n            \n        institution.admin_order_field = 'institution_id'",
