    "description": "django-disqus-sync\n=================\n\nThis app is lightweight SEO optimizer for DISQUS comment system for your Django\napplication.\n\nIt features Django management command/Celery task to sync comments from DISQUS to\nyour database and to embed them to the page for web crawlers like Google. DISQUS\ncomment system is JS based and Google still has issues indexing it.\n\nThis app also features template tag to embed prerendered comments to your page.\n\nInstallation & usage\n-----\n\nFirst, install using pip:\n\n\n```\npip install django-disqus-sync\n```\n\nNext, you need to create DISQUS app in order to be able to use their API to download\ncomments.\n\nYou can create your app here: https://disqus.com/api/applications/\n\nThen, configure in your django `settings.py` using keys you were given:\n\n```\nDISQUS_API_KEY = '...'\nDISQUS_API_SECRET = '...'\nDISQUS_WEBSITE_SHORTNAME = '[NAME OF YOUR DISQUS FORUM HERE]'\n```\n\nAlso make sure you have **some cache configured** since this apps needs it to\nsave queries and load temporary URL to THREAD list.\n\nNext, you need to setup period updates of comments in your forum. Either set up\na cron to run management command:\n\n```\nmanage.py disqus_sync\n```\n\nOr, you can use Celery to run it. Celery task should be auto-registered and you\nonly need to configure Celerybeat to fire it up from time to time.\n\n\nLast, use the templatetag in your templates to embed comments:\n\n```\n{% load disqus_sync %}\n{% render_disqus_comments %}\n```\n\nThat's it, comments should be rendered to your page. **They will not be seen\nin browser, because they are by default wrapped in \"display: none;\" div.**\n\nYou can override template used to render the comments by creating\n`disqus_sync/comments.html`, `disqus_sync/comment.html` or both.\n",
