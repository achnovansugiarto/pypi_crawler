    "description": "LiveMonitor\nby Ryan Birmingham\n\n==note that testing is underway==\nLiveMonitor allows for you to check on the status of your network services and devices. Check port status, see networked host information, and check log summaries.\n\nCheck ports: Define hosts and ports to check; check specific ports on specitic hosts, or ports on all hosts. LiveMonitor will asyncrounously check so you can get a concice picture of your network.\n\nCheck hosts: Quickly determine what's new and what's missing on your network.\n\nCheck logs: Write a rule to parse a log format, or use one of the existing ones. See warnings, errors, and odd behavior on multiple services on multiple hosts in one place.\n\n\n==Currently under development==\nCustomize output: Want to use LiveMonitor as an api? Want a command line output? Create your own outputs to match your workflow.",
