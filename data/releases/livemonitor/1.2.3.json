    "description": "LiveMonitor\nby Ryan Birmingham\n(docs here: http://www.rbirm.us/LiveMonitor/)\n\nLiveMonitor allows for you to check on the status of your network services and devices. Check port status, see networked host information, and check log summaries.\n\nCheck ports: Define hosts and ports to check; check specific ports on specitic hosts, or ports on all hosts. LiveMonitor will asyncrounously check so you can get a concice picture of your network.\n\nCheck hosts: Quickly determine what's new and what's missing on your network.\n\nCheck logs: Write a rule to parse a log format, or use one of the existing ones. See warnings, errors, and odd behavior on multiple services on multiple hosts in one place.\n\nUse the built in Monitor.serve() command to serve all of your monitor results as an API.\n\nDevelop with me: https://github.com/birm/LiveMonitor\n\n==TODO==\nBuild/Run testing",
