    "description": "# Netcdf driver\nThis drb-driver-netcdf module implements netcdf format access with DRB data model. It is able to navigates among the netcdf contents.\n\n## Netcdf Factory and Netcdf Node\nThe module implements the basic factory model defined in DRB in its node resolver. Based on the python entry point mechanism, this module can be dynamically imported into applications.\n\nThe entry point group reference is `drb.driver`.<br/>\nThe driver name is `netcdf`.<br/>\nThe factory class `DrbNetcdfFactory` is encoded into `drb.drivers.factory`\nmodule.<br/>\n\n\nThe netCDF 4.0 data model is based on recursive structure of Groups each containing a set of Attributes, Dimensions and Variables. It also includes User-defined set of types.\nThe Drb structure implemented here, reproduces this representation.\nAttributes are reported in node as node attributes whereas Dimensions and Values are reported as node children. The raw content is available in Variable node requesting array (xarray, or numpy ndarray types)\n\n## limitations\nThe current version does not manage child modification and insertion. `DrbNetcdfNode` is currently read only.\nThe factory to build DrbNetcdfNode supports file directly opening it with path, for other implementation ByteIO or BufferedIOBase, they are manged with a local temporary file, removed when the node is closed..\n\n## limitations HDF-EOS file\nWhen open a HDF-EOS file in HDF4 format\nIf fails with message:`[Errno -128] NetCDF: Attempt to use feature that was not turned on when netCDF was built`\nThis means that NetCDF system library linked with netCDF4 python wasn't compiled with HDF4 support.\nYou can try to install netCDF4 python by conda\n```commandline\nconda install -c conda-forge netcdf4\n```\nOr rebuild netCDF4 locally with netCDF library with support hdf4 turned ON\n\n## Using this module\nTo include this module into your project, the `drb-driver-netcdf` module shall be referenced into `requirements.txt` file, or the following pip line can be run:\n```commandline\npip install drb-driver-netcdf\n```\n\n\n\n\n",
