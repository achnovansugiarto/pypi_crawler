    "description": "# mcipc\nA Minecraft inter-process communication API implementing the [RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) and [Query](http://wiki.vg/Query) protocols.\n\n## News\n\n### 2020-12-21 - mcipc-2.0\nGreat news: `mcipc` is now available in version 2.  \nThe version 2 update includes the outsourcing of the RCON protocol and client implementation into an [own project](https://github.com/conqp/rcon).  \nThis allowes for the RCON library to be used independently of mcipc, e.g. for other games which support the RCON protocol.  \nFurthermore `mcipc`'s RCON client implementations have been overhauled. They now provide functions to interact with the respective server.  \nIt was therefor necessary to not have one implementation of `mcipc.rcon.Client`, but three:\n\n*  `mcipc.rcon.be.Client` Client for Bedrock Edition servers.\n*  `mcipc.rcon.ee.Client` Client for Education Edition servers.\n*  `mcipc.rcon.je.Client` Client for Java Edition servers.\n\nTo provide some backwards compatibility, the `mcipc.rcon.Client` is now an alias for `mcipc.rcon.je.Client`.  \nYou'll find a full documentation of each client's capabilities, i.e. methods in the [documentation](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\n## Requirements\n`mcipc` requires Python 3.8 or higher.  \nIt also depends on [rcon](https://github.com/conqp/rcon) which has been split from this project.  \nIf you install `mcicp` via `pip`, it will automatically be installed as a dependency.\n\n## Documentation\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mcipc/badge/?version=latest)](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)  \nDocumentation is available on [readthedocs](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\n## Quick start\n\nInstall mcipc from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-mcipc/) or via:\n\n    pip install mcipc\n\n### Query protocol\nThe `Query` protcol is used to query a Minecraft server for server information.  \nThe Minecraft query protocol has two query modes: *basic stats* and *full stats*.\n\n```python\nfrom mcipc.query import Client\n\nwith Client('127.0.0.1', 25565) as client:\n    basic_stats = client.basic_stats    # Get basic stats.\n    full_stats = client.full_stats      # Get full stats.\n\nprint(basic_stats)\nprint(full_stats)\n```\n\n### RCON protocol\nThe `RCON` protocol is used to remotely control a Minecraft server, i.e. execute\ncommands on a Minecraft server and receive the respective results.\n\n```python\nfrom mcipc.rcon.je import Biome, Client     # For Java Edition servers.\n#from mcipc.rcon.be import Client           # For Bedrock Edition servers.\n#from mcipc.rcon.ee import Client           # For Education Edition servers.\n\nwith Client('127.0.0.1', 5000, passwd='mysecretpassword') as client:\n    seed = client.seed                              # Get the server's seed.\n    players = client.players                        # Get the server's players info.\n    mansion = client.locate('mansion')              # Get the next mansion's location.\n    badlands = client.locatebiome(Biome.BADLANDS)   # Get the next location of a badlands biome.\n\nprint(seed)\nprint(players)\nprint(mansion)\nprint(badlands)\n```\n\nExample output of the above commands with a Java Edition client:\n\n```python\n-8217057902979500137\nPlayers(online=1, max=20, players=(Player(name='coNQP', uuid=None, state=None),))\nLocation(name='mansion', x=-7216, y=None, z=-1952, distance=7479)\nLocation(name='minecraft:badlands', x=1512, y=None, z=3388, distance=3634)\n```\n\n## Credits\nMany thanks to all contributers to the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/) and the [Wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Main_Page).\n\n## License\nCopyright (C) 2018-2020 Richard Neumann <mail at richard dash neumann period de>\n\nmcipc is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nmcipc is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
