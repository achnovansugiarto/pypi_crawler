    "description": "# mcipc\n\nA Minecraft inter-process communication API implementing the [RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) and [Query](http://wiki.vg/Query) protocols.\n\n## Requirements\n`mcipc` requires Python 3.8 or higher.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Query protocol\nThe `Query` protcol is used to query a Minecraft server for server information.  \nThe Minecraft query protocol has two query modes: *basic stats* and *full stats*.\n\n#### Basic stats\nTo get *basic stats* from a Minecraft server, it must enable the `Query` protocol.  \nYou can enable the query protocol on a Minecraft server by setting `enable-query = true` in the server's `server.properties` file.\nTo specify a deviating port, you can set `query.port = <port>` in the same file.  \nThe following example assumes a server running on `127.0.0.1` and on the default query port `25565`:\n\n    from mcipc.query import Client\n\n    with Client('127.0.0.1', 25565) as client:\n        basic_stats = client.basic_stats\n\n    print(basic_stats)\n\nThe type of `basic_stats` is a named tuple with the following properties:\n\n* `type`: The packet type (`Type`, protocol information).\n* `session_id`: The query's session ID (`int`, protocol information).\n* `motd`: The server's message of the day (`str`).\n* `game_type`: The game type (`str`).\n* `map`: The current map (`str`).\n* `num_players`: The amount of online players (`int`).\n* `max_players`: The amount of maximally allowed players (`int`).\n* `host_port`: The server's port (`int`).\n* `host_ip`: The server's IP address (`ipaddress.IPv4Address`).\n\n#### Full stats\nFor retrieving full stats of a server, the same premises apply.\n\n    from mcipc.query import Client\n\n    with Client('127.0.0.1', 25565) as client:\n        full_stats = client.full_stats\n\n    print(full_stats)\n\nThe type of `full_stats` is a named tuple with the following properties:\n\n* `type`: The packet type (`Type`, protocol information).\n* `session_id`: The query's session ID (`int`, protocol information).\n* `host_name`: The server's message of the day (`str`, same as BasicStats.motd).\n* `game_type`: The game type (`str`).\n* `game_id`: The game ID (`str`).\n* `version`: The game version (`str`).\n* `plugins`: The used plugins (`dict`).\n* `map`: The current map (`str`).\n* `num_players`: The amount of online players (`int`).\n* `max_players`: The amount of maximally allowed players (`int`).\n* `host_port`: The server's port (`int`).\n* `host_ip`: The server's IP address (`ipaddress.IPv4Address`).\n* `players`: The names of online players (`tuple` of `str`).\n\n### RCON protocol\nThe `RCON` protocol is used to remotely control a Minecraft server, i.e. execute\ncommands on a Minecraft server and receive the respective results.  \nTo enable `RCON` on a Minecraft server, you must set `enable-rcon = true` in the\nserver's `server.properties` file.\nFurthermore, you need to specify a port for the RCON server by setting `rcon.port = <port>`\nand a password by setting `rcon.password = <password>` in the same file.  \nThe following example assumes a server running on `127.0.0.1` and on the RCON port `5000` with password `'mysecretpassword'`:\n\n    from mcipc.rcon import Client\n\n    with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000) as client:\n        client.login('mysecretpassword')    # Perform initial login.\n        seed = client.seed                  # Get the server's seed.\n        players = client.players            # Get the server's players info.\n        mansion = client.locate('Mansion')  # Get the next mansion's location.\n\n    print(seed)\n    print(players)\n    print(mansion)\n\n\nThe type of `seed` is `Seed` which is derived from `int` and can be used just like the latter.  \nThe type of `players` is `Players`, a named tuple:\n\n* `online`: The amount of online players (`int`).\n* `max`: The amount of maximally allowed players (`int`).\n* `names`: The names of online players (`tuple` of `str`).\n\nThe type of `mansion` is `Location` which describes the x-y-z location of the next located object.\n\n* `x`: x-coordinate (`int`).\n* `y`: y-coordinate (`int` or `None`).\n* `z`: z-coordinate (`int`).\n\n*HINT:* The y-component of a location may be `None`, which represents the special Minectaft vector component `'~'`.\n\n### Handling connection timeouts.\nSince version 1.2.1, you can specify an optional `timeout=<sec>` parameter on both `Query` and `RCON` clients.  \nIf a timout is reached during a connection attempt, it will raise a `socket.timeout` exception.  \nThe following example will raise a connection timeout after 1.5 seconds:\n\n    try:\n        with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000, timeout=1.5) as client:\n            <do_stuff>\n    except socket.timeout as timeout:\n        <handle_connection_timeout>\n\n## Scripts\nThis library also ships a couple of scripts intended as a proof-of-concept.\n\n* `rconclt`: An `RCON` client.\n* `rconshell`: An interactive `RCON` shell.\n\n### `rconclt`\nThe script `rconclt` is an RCON client script to communicate with minecraft servers using the shell.  \nTo invoke a pre-defined server configuration (see below):\n\n    rconclt my_server <command> [<args>...] [options]\n\n## Configuration\n`rconclt` can be configured in `/etc/mcipc.d/rcon.conf`:\n\n    [my_server]\n    host = 127.0.0.1\n    port = 5000\n    passwd = mysecretpassword\n\nThe `passwd` entry is optional.\n\n## License\nCopyright (C) 2018 Richard Neumann <mail at richard dash neumann period de>\n\nmcipc is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nmcipc is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
