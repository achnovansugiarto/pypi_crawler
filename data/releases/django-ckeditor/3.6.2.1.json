    "description": "Django CKEditor\n================\n**Django admin CKEditor integration.**\n\nProvides a ``RichTextField`` and ``CKEditorWidget`` utilizing CKEditor with image upload and browsing support included.\n\n.. contents:: Contents\n    :depth: 5\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nRequired\n~~~~~~~~\n#. Install or add django-ckeditor to your python path.\n\n#. Add ``ckeditor`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.\n\n#. Run the ``collectstatic`` management command: ``$ /manage.py collectstatic``. This'll copy static CKEditor require media resources into the directory given by the ``STATIC_ROOT`` setting. See `Django's documentation on managing static files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files>`_ for more info.\n\n#. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies an absolute filesystem path to your CKEditor media upload directory. Make sure you have write permissions for the path, i.e.::\n\n    CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = \"/home/media/media.lawrence.com/uploads\"\n\n#. Add CKEditor URL include to your project's ``urls.py`` file::\n    \n    (r'^ckeditor/', include('ckeditor.urls')),    \n\nOptional\n~~~~~~~~\n#. Set the CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER setting to ``True`` in the project's ``settings.py`` file (default ``False``). This restricts access to uploaded images to the uploading user (e.g. each user only sees and uploads their own images). Superusers can still see all images. **NOTE**: This restriction is only enforced within the CKEditor media browser. \n\n#. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies a URL prefix to media uploaded through CKEditor, i.e.::\n\n       CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX = \"http://media.lawrence.com/media/ckuploads/\n       \n   (If CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX is not provided, the media URL will fall back to MEDIA_URL with the difference of MEDIA_ROOT and the uploaded resource's full path and filename appended.)\n\n#. Add a CKEDITOR_CONFIGS setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This specifies sets of CKEditor settings that are passed to CKEditor (see CKEditor's `Setting Configurations <http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Setting_Configurations>`_), i.e.::\n\n       CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {\n           'awesome_ckeditor': {\n               'toolbar': 'Basic',\n           },\n       }\n   \n   The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a RichTextField::\n\n       content = RichTextField(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')\n\n   The name of the settings can be referenced when instantiating a CKEditorWidget::\n\n       widget = CKEditorWidget(config_name='awesome_ckeditor')\n   \n   By specifying a set named ``default`` you'll be applying its settings to all RichTextField and CKEditorWidget objects for which ``config_name`` has not been explicitly defined ::\n       \n       CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {\n           'default': {\n               'toolbar': 'Full',\n               'height': 300,\n               'width': 300,\n           },\n       }\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nField\n~~~~~\nThe quickest way to add rich text editing capabilities to your models is to use the included ``RichTextField`` model field type. A CKEditor widget is rendered as the form field but in all other regards the field behaves as the standard Django ``TextField``. For example::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField\n\n    class Post(models.Model):\n        content = RichTextField()\n\n\nWidget\n~~~~~~\nAlernatively you can use the included ``CKEditorWidget`` as the widget for a formfield. For example::\n\n    from django import forms\n    from django.contrib import admin\n    from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget\n\n    from post.models import Post\n\n    class PostAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):\n        content = forms.CharField(widget=CKEditorWidget())\n        class Meta:\n            model = Post\n\n    class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n        form = PostAdminForm\n    \n    admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)\n\nManagment Commands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncluded is a management command to create thumbnails for images already contained in ``CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH``. This is useful to create thumbnails when starting to use django-ckeditor with existing images. Issue the command as follows::\n    \n    $ ./manage.py generateckeditorthumbnails\n\n**NOTE**: If you're using custom views remember to include ckeditor.js in your form's media either through ``{{ form.media }}`` or through a ``<script>`` tag. Admin will do this for you automatically. See `Django's Form Media docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/media/>`_ for more info.\n\nAUTHORS\n=======\n\nCreated By\n----------\n#. `shaunsephton <http://github.com/shaunsephton>`_\n\nContributors\n------------\n#. `3point2 <https://github.com/3point2>`_\n#. `buchuki <http://github.com/buchuki>`_\n#. `chr15m <http://github.com/chr15m>`_\n#. `hedleyroos <https://github.com/hedleyroos>`_\n#. `jeffh <https://github.com/jeffh>`_\n#. `loop0 <http://github.com/loop0>`_\n#. `mwcz <https://github.com/mwcz>`_\n#. `tomwys <https://github.com/tomwys>`_\n#.
