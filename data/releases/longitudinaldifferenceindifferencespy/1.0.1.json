The problem is that there are potentially many other effects at play. One analysis method for doing this is called a difference in differences analysis. If I had done nothing, then what would have happened to the numbers I care about or \"key performance indicators\" (KPI) after people started using my product.\n\nIt's not always feasible (e.g. due to cost or lack of necessary infrastructure) or ethical (e.g. randomly assigning a cancer-causing drug to a subgroup of the population sample) to run a fully randomized experiment when building a product. If you're looking to measure impact on some quantitative KPIs and you can't run experiments/\"randomized control trials\"/\"AB Testing\", then this type of analysis is for you.\n\nThanks to Sol Sadeghi (Cosine Data Science team @ Microsoft) for informing me about this analysis technique and helping with the initial code review!\n\n# Case Study\n\nExample of how this tool was used inside of Microsoft to show the (5+%) impact of a product on internal/\"1st party\" developer productivity within the Windows division at Microsoft coming soon.\n\n# Getting Started\n[Our documentation is available on this repository's wiki.](https://github.com/microsoft/LongitudinalDifferenceInDifferencesPy/wiki)\n\n\n# Demo\n\nTo see a full demonstration of the tool with some example data, \n1. Navigate to the `example` directory.\n2. Run the following command:\n```python\npython exampleDIDAnalysis.py\n```\n\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
