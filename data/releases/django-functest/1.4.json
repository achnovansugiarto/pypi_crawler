If such\nan approach seems old-fashioned to you, have a look at `htmx.org\n<https://htmx.org/>`_ or `hotwire <https://hotwired.dev/>`_ and get with the new\nkids! (OK most of are actually quite old but we make fast web sites...)\n\nUnder the hood, the WSGI-based method uses and builds upon `WebTest\n<http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/>`_ and `django-webtest\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-webtest>`_.\n\ndjango-functest provides its functionality as mixins, so that you can have your\nown base class for tests.\n\nContributing and tests\n----------------------\n\nSee `CONTRIBUTING.rst <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for information about running the test suite and\ncontributing to django-functest.\n\n\nPaid support\n------------\n\nSome of the maintainers are able to provide support on a paid basis for this\nOpen Source project. This includes the following kinds of things:\n\n* Paying for bug fixes or new features (with the understanding that these\n  changes will become freely available as part of the project and are not\n  'owned' by the person who paid for them).\n\n* Debugging or other support for integrating django-functest into your project.\n\n* Writing a test suite for you from scratch using django-functest.\n\nIf you are interested in these, you can contact the following developers:\n\n* Luke Plant - long time Django expert and contributor - `info and status <https://lukeplant.me.uk/development-work.html>`_.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis library was written originally by `spookylukey <https://github.com/spookylukey/>`_,\nfurther improved by developers at `Wolf & Badger\n<https://www.wolfandbadger.com/>`_, and released with the kind permission of that\ncompany.\n\nTools used in rendering this package:\n\n*  Cookiecutter_\n*  `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_\n\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`cookiecutter-djangopackage`: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage\n\n\n",
