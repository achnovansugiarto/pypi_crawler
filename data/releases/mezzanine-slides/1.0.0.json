    "description": "# mezzanine-slides\n\nAdd simple slide functionality to your Mezzanine based website allowing for\nbeautiful banners at the tops of pages.\n\n\n# Setup\n\nAdd `mezzanine_slides` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and syncdb. Migrations are\nincluded if you use South. You can use the templates included by running\n`collecttemplates` but this will overwrite any changes you have made to your\n`base.html` and `pages/page.html` templates. If you wish to add the template\nmarkup yourself see Templates below.\n\n\n# Templates\n\nAdd this to your `pages/page.html` anywhere as long as it's not inside another\nblock:\n\n    {% block slides %}{% if page.slide_set.all %}\n    <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"span12\">\n        <ul class=\"rslides\">{% for image in page.slide_set.all %}\n            <li><img src=\"{{ image.file.url }}\" alt=\"{{ image.description }}\"/></li>\n        {% endfor %}</ul>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    {% endif %}{% endblock %}\n\nAdd this to `base.html` where you would like the slides to appear, which is\nusually between your main content and the navigation:\n\n    {% block slides %}{% endblock %}\n\nNotice that I include the `row` and `span12` classes on the `pages/page.html`\ntemplate so that if you don't have any slides then nothing is added to the page.\n\nNow you'll need to include the CSS and JS in your compress areas of your\n`base.html` template:\n\n    {% compress css %}\n    ...\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}css/responsiveslides.css\">\n    {% endcompress %}\n\n    \n    {% compress js %}\n    ...\n    <script src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}js/responsiveslides.min.js\"></script>\n    {% endcompress %}\n\nLastly you'll need to invoke the slides JavaScript by putting\n`$('.rslides').responsiveSlides();` on in your JavaScript somewhere. In the\n`base.html` template I put this in the header around line 34 where I found some\nother JavaScript functions to just make it easy and try to conform to the\noriginal Mezzanine as much as possible, here is an excerpt of the area:\n\n    <script>\n    $(function() {\n        ...\n        $('.rslides').responsiveSlides();\n    });\n    </script>\n\n## License (Simplified BSD)\n\nCopyright (c) Isaac Bythewood  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
