    "description": "GLUE: Grid LSC User Environment\n\nGlue is a collection of utilities for running data analysis pipelines\nfor online and offline analysis as well as accessing various grid\nutilities.  It also provides the infrastructure for the segment\ndatabase.\n\nThe Glue web site:\n\n   http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/glue.html\n\ncontains many useful links for Glue users and developers.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about Glue, please send them to the\nlal-discuss mailing list. You may join this list at: There are two\nLALApps mail lists/archives which are shared with LAL. These are:\n\n  http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/lal-discuss\n\nThis README file explains how to build and install Glue.\n\nGLUE is distributed under the GNU General Public, version 3. See the\nfile LICENSE for more information.\n\nIf you use GLUE in published scientific work, we request that you\ninclude a reference in your work as follows:\n\n\"Workflows were generated using the Grid LSC User Environment (GLUE)\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Determine your Python version\n\nPython version 2.7 or greater is required to install Glue. Type:\n\n  python -V\n\nto determine the version of python installed on your machine. For\nexample:\n\n  [duncan@contra lalapps]$ python -V\n  Python 2.7\n\nIf you do not have version 2.7 or greater installed, contact your system\nadministrator for help installing Python.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Get Glue from Git\n\nGlue is part of the LALSuite Git repository. First choose a directory in\nwhich to install the LALSuite sources. In this example, we install the\nsources into ${HOME}/src. If you decide to install somewhere else,\nchange ${HOME}/src to the directory you have chosen. Change\nalbert.einstein in the git clone below to your ligo.org kerberos\nprinciple, if you have one. Type:\n\n  mkdir -p ${HOME}/src\n  cd ${HOME}/src\n  git clone git+ssh://albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/usr/local/git/lalsuite.git\n\nIf you do not have a ligo.org kerberos principle you can get the source\ncode anonymously using:\n\n  git clone git://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/lalsuite.git\n\nThis will create a directory ${HOME}/src/lalsuite containing the\nLALSuite sources.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Build and Install Glue\n\nChoose a location in which to install Glue. In this example we choose\n/opt/glue. You must have write access to this directory, so you may wish\nto install in ${HOME}, for example. Set the environment variable\n${GLUE_LOCATION} to point to your chosen install directory. Bash or sh\nusers should type:\n\n  export GLUE_LOCATION=/opt/glue\n\nand csh users should type:\n\n  setenv GLUE_LOCATION /opt/glue\n\nAssuming you have installed the glue sources in ${HOME}/src/glue, type:\n\n  cd ${HOME}/src/lalsuite/glue\n  ${PYTHON} setup.py install --prefix=${GLUE_LOCATION}\n\nThis will build and install all the glue modules and programs.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Set up your Environment for Using Glue\n\nIf you are a bash or sh user, edit your .profile (or .bash_profile) file\nand add the lines (changing /opt/glue to wherever you installed Glue):\n\n  export GLUE_LOCATION=/opt/glue\n  if [ -f ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.sh ] ; then\n    source ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.sh\n  fi\n\nIf you are a csh user, edit your .login file and add the lines (changing\n/opt/glue to wherever you installed Glue):\n\n  setenv GLUE_LOCATION /opt/glue\n  if ( -f ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.csh ) then\n    source ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.csh\n  endif\n\nNow log out and log back in to ensure that all environment variables\nhave been updated.\n\nYou may now use Glue! Please report any problems via the Gnats database\nlinked from the Glue home page.\n",
