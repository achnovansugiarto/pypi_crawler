    "description": "# Maze Solver\n#### Created by Tommy Dougiamas  \n\nThis algorithm finds the shortest path through black and white maze images. It outputs an image with the path marked in green.\n\n\n### Installing\n\n**Easy Installation**\n\nCheck that your python version is >=3.5 with `python3 -V`. (You might have to use `python3.5` or similar).\nAlso make sure that pip is installed with `python3 -m pip -V`.\n\nTo install, simply run `python3 -m pip install mazesolver` on the command line as root/admin. \n\nYou can run the tool using `mazesolver`.\n\n**Install from source**\n\n##### For GNU/Linux:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/exciteabletom/mazesolver.git`\n\n`cd mazesolver`\n\n`python3 setup.py build`\n\n`sudo python3 setup.py install`\n\n##### For Windows CMD:\n\nMake sure your prompt has admin permissions.\n\n`git clone https://github.com/exciteabletom/mazesolver.git`\n\n`chdir mazesolver`\n\n`python3 setup.py build`\n\n`python3 setup.py install`\n\n\n\n### What are the rules for maze images?\n- Walls marked with black pixels and paths marked with white pixels\n\n- Walls around the entire maze\n\n- One entrance on the top row and one exit on the bottom row\n\n*If this is confusing, check out some of the example mazes in the **pics** directory.*\n\n\n\n### How do I use it?\n\nYou can use `mazesolver --help` to get a list of commands.\n\nMake sure that your image meets the specifications above.\n\nNormal usage will look something like this: `mazesolver -i path/to/input_img -o path/to/output_dir`\n\n\n\n### How does the algorithm work?\n\n- Start at the entrance and label it zero.\n\n- Move to any neighbouring cells and mark them with 1\n\n- Move to any of the cells neighbouring the ones marked 1 and label them 2\n\n- Continue doing this until all cells are marked\n\n- Start from the exit of the maze and move to any neighbouring cell that == the current cell's number -1. Until we reach 0 (the entrance).\n\nWe now have the shortest path from the entrance to the exit!\n\n\n> Licensed under GNU GPLv3",
