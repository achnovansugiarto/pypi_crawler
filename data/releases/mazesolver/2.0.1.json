It outputs an image with the path marked in green.   \n\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exciteabletom/mazesolver/master/pics/crazyMazeBig.jpg\"/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exciteabletom/mazesolver/master/pics/crazyMazeBig_out.jpg\"/>\n\n## Installing\n\nCheck that your python version is >=3.5 with `python3 -V`.\nAlso make sure that pip is installed with `python3 -m pip -V`.\n\nTo install, simply run `python3 -m pip install mazesolver --user` on the command line.\n\nYou can run the tool using `mazesolver` or `mazesolver.exe`.\n\n## What are the rules for maze images?\n- Walls marked with black pixels and paths marked with white pixels\n\n- Walls around the entire maze\n\n- One entrance on the top row and one exit on the bottom row\n\n*If this is confusing, check out some of the example mazes in the **pics** directory.*\n\n\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nYou can use `mazesolver --help` to get a list of commands.\n\nMake sure that your image meets the specifications above.\n\nNormal usage will look something like this: `mazesolver -i path/to/input_img -o path/to/output_dir/`\n\n\n\n## How does the algorithm work?\n\n- Start at the entrance and label it zero.\n\n- Move to any neighbouring cells and mark them with 1\n\n- Move to any of the cells neighbouring the ones marked 1 and label them 2\n\n- Continue doing this until all cells are marked\n\n- Start from the exit of the maze and move to any neighbouring cell that == the current cell's number -1. Until we reach 0 (the entrance).\n\nWe now have the shortest path from the entrance to the exit!\n\n\n",
