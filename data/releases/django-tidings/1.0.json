    "description": "==============\ndjango-tidings\n==============\n\ndjango-tidings is a framework for sending email notifications to users who have\nregistered interest in certain events, such as the modification of some model\nobject. Used by support.mozilla.com, it is optimized for large-scale\ninstallations. Its features include...\n\n* Asynchronous operation using the ``celery`` task queue\n* De-duplication of notifications\n* Association of subscriptions with either registered Django users or anonymous\n  email addresses\n* Optional confirmation of anonymous subscriptions\n* Hook points for customizing any page drawn and any email sent\n\nPlease see the full documentation at http://packages.python.org/django-tidings/\n\nVersion History\n===============\n\n1.0 (2015-03-03)\n  * Support Django 1.6.\n  * Fix a bug in reconstituting models under (perhaps) Django 1.5.x and up.\n  * Remove rate limit on ``claim_watches`` task.\n  * Add tox to support testing against multiple Django versions.\n\n0.4\n  * Fix a deprecated celery import path.\n  * Add support for newer versions of Django, and drop support for older ones.\n    We now support 1.4 and 1.5.\n  * Add an initial South migration.\n\n.. warning::\n\n  If you're already using South in your project, you need to run the following\n  command to create a \"fake\" migration step in South's migration history::\n\n      python path/to/manage.py migrate tidings --fake\n\n0.3\n  * Support excluding multiple users when calling\n    ``fire()``.\n\n0.2\n  * API change: ``_mails()`` now receives,\n    in each user/watch tuple, a list of ``Watch``\n    objects rather than just a single one. This enables you to list all\n    relevant watches in your emails or to make decisions from an\n    ``EventUnion``'s ``_mails()`` method based on\n    what kind of events the user was subscribed to.\n  * Expose a few attribute docs to Sphinx.\n\n0.1\n  * Initial release. In production on support.mozilla.com. API may change.",
