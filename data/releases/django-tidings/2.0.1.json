    "description": "==========================================================\nFramework for asynchronous email notifications from Django\n==========================================================\n\ndjango-tidings is a framework for sending email notifications to users who have\nregistered interest in certain events, such as the modification of some model\nobject. Used by support.mozilla.org_ and developer.mozilla.org_, it is\noptimized for large-scale installations. Its features include...\n\n* Asynchronous operation using the celery_ task queue\n* De-duplication of notifications\n* Association of subscriptions with either registered Django users or anonymous\n  email addresses\n* Optional confirmation of anonymous subscriptions\n* Hook points for customizing any page drawn and any email sent\n\nPlease see the full documentation at django-tidings.readthedocs.io_.\n\n.. _celery: http://www.celeryproject.org/\n.. _support.mozilla.org: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/\n.. _developer.mozilla.org: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\n.. _django-tidings.readthedocs.io: https://django-tidings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\nVersion History\n===============\n\n2.0.1 (2018-02-14)\n  * Fix a bug where asynchronously firing a task (the default) would\n    raise an exception when run via Celery.\n\n2.0 (2018-02-10)\n  * Added support for Django 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, and 2.0.\n  * Dropped support for Django 1.7 and South.\n  * Dropped support for jingo_. Templates for the ``unsubscribe`` view are now\n    standard Django templates.\n  * Added ``Event.fire(delay=False)``, to avoid using the\n    pickle serializer, which has `security concerns`_.\n  * Added setting ``TIDINGS_TEMPLATE_EXTENSION`` to allow changing the\n    template extension used by the ``unsubscribe`` view from ``html`` to\n    ``jinja``, ``j2``, etc.\n  * Migrated Watch.email from a maximum length of 75 to 254, to follow the\n    EmailField update in Django 1.8.\n\n.. _`security concerns`: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/security.html#serializers\n.. _jingo: https://github.com/jbalogh/jingo\n\n1.2 (2017-03-22)\n  * Added support for Django 1.8 and Python 3\n  * Dropped support for Python 2.6\n\n1.1 (2015-04-23)\n  * Added support for Django 1.7\n  * Dropped support for Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6\n  * Dropped mock, Fabric and django-nose dependencies.\n  * Moved tests outside of app and simplified test setup.\n  * Added Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/django-tidings\n  * Moved to ReadTheDocs: https://django-tidings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n1.0 (2015-03-03)\n  * Support Django 1.6.\n  * Fix a bug in reconstituting models under (perhaps) Django 1.5.x and up.\n  * Remove rate limit on ``claim_watches`` task.\n  * Add tox to support testing against multiple Django versions.\n\n0.4\n  * Fix a deprecated celery import path.\n  * Add support for newer versions of Django, and drop support for older ones.\n    We now support 1.4 and 1.5.\n  * Add an initial South migration.\n\n.. warning::\n\n  If you're already using South in your project, you need to run the following\n  command to create a \"fake\" migration step in South's migration history::\n\n      python path/to/manage.py migrate tidings --fake\n\n0.3\n  * Support excluding multiple users when calling\n    ``fire()``.\n\n0.2\n  * API change: ``_mails()`` now receives,\n    in each user/watch tuple, a list of ``Watch``\n    objects rather than just a single one. This enables you to list all\n    relevant watches in your emails or to make decisions from an\n    ``EventUnion``'s ``_mails()`` method based on\n    what kind of events the user was subscribed to.\n  * Expose a few attribute docs to Sphinx.\n\n0.1\n  * Initial release. In production on support.mozilla.com. API may change.\n\n\n\n",
