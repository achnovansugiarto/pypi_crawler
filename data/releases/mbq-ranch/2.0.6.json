    "description": "Ranch\n=====\n\nStandardized tooling, monitoring, and retry logic for use with Celery\n\n## Installation\n\nRanch is a Django application. To use Ranch with Celery, add the following to your settings file:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n    'mbq.ranch'\n]\n\nRANCH = {\n    'env': ENV_NAME,  # e.g. production, development\n    'service': MY_SERVICE_NAME,  # e.g. os-core\n}\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Metrics\n\nAny application with Ranch installed will have Celery metrics available in [the Celery/Ranch DataDog Dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/930140/celery--ranch).\n\n### Monitors\n\n*TODO: Include link to Invoice's monitors once they're built*\n\nYou may set up monitors for your application using the metrics provided by Ranch. To get started, you might want to copy Invoicing's monitors.\n\n### Dead Letter Queue\n\nCelery jobs that fail will be stored in the application's database for inspection and reprocessing. Ranch provides an Admin interface for this.\n\nSee [OS Core's Ranch Admin](https://api.managedbyq.com/admin/ranch/loggedtask/) for an example.\n\n### Correlation IDs\n\nRanch can flow correlation IDs through your Celery jobs. Ranch will *not* change any of your logging configuration, so you'll still need to do that as part of your correlation ID implementation.\n\nTo use the correlation ID functionality, add the following settings:\n\n```python\nRANCH = {\n    ...,\n    'correlation': {\n        'getter': getter_fn,  # callable with no args that returns the current correlation ID\n        'setter': setter_fn,  # callable with one arg which should be set as the current correlation ID\n    },\n}\n```\n\n### Supplemental Error Tagging\n\nRanch provides a hook to add additional tagging information to error item metrics. This is used in OS Core to tag each error as belonging to a specific team.\n\nTo use this feature, add the following settings:\n\n```python\nRANCH = {\n    ...,\n    # tags_fn takes a single arg (the Ranch Task object that failed)\n    # and should return a list of strings in the format \"tag_name:tag_value\"\n    # See OS Core's usage for an example\n    'extra_error_queue_tags_fn': tags_fn,\n}\n```",
