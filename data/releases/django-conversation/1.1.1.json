    "description": "Django Conversation\n===================\n\nA reusable Django app that provides threaded conversations between users.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo get the latest stable release from PyPi\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install django-conversation\n\nTo get the latest commit from GitHub\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/bitmazk/django-conversation.git#egg=conversation\n\nTODO: Describe further installation steps (edit / remove the examples below):\n\nAdd ``conversation`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...,\n        'conversation',\n    )\n\nAdd the ``conversation`` URLs to your ``urls.py``\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        ...\n        url(r'^conversation/', include('conversation.urls')),\n    )\n\nDon't forget to migrate your database\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    ./manage.py migrate conversation\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe conversations in this app are threaded, that means a conversation is\nrelated to one object. In this case the object is a user. So if ``user1``\nstarts a conversation with ``user2`` all messages between those users are\nstored in one conversation (you know it, if your are e.g. a Facebook user).\n\nThis app allows another relation, so you can also add a content object to a\nconversation between two users. Let's say you built a sports app. ``user1``\nwants to talk with ``user2`` about a fight called ``Klitschko vs. Tyson``. They\ncan now start a conversation, which is also related to that fight. But, they\ncan also start a new conversation about other fights or talk to each other\nwithout another relation, for sure.\n\nIf you have executed the tasks written above, the app is ready to work.\nNote: The templates are based on Twitter Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/).\nIf you don't use it, simply overwrite them.\n\nIn almost every case you want to customize stuff, add jQuery/JavaScript, add\nCSS, your own templates and so on, so this app is kept very simple.\n\n\nSettings\n--------\n\nCONVERSATION_MESSAGE_FORM\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nDefault: None\n\nIf you want to use your own message form, you can define it here::\n\n    CONVERSATION_MESSAGE_FORM = 'my_app.forms.MyMessageForm'\n\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project, please perform the following steps\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    # Fork this repository\n    # Clone your fork\n    $ mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 django-conversation\n    $ python setup.py install\n    $ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt\n\n    $ git co -b feature_branch master\n    # Implement your feature and tests\n    $ git add . && git commit\n    $ git push -u origin feature_branch\n    # Send us a pull request for your feature branch",
