    "description": "DjangoOpenInviter\n=================\n\nAllows users of django and python to access the open inviter system.\n`OpenInviter.com <http://openinviter.com/>`_ is a widely used contact\nimporter. It allows you to import your contacts from a wide scala of\nemail services and social networks.\n\nby:\n    thierryschellenbach at gmail.com\n\n    http://www.mellowmorning.com/\n\nAttempts to port the undocumented open inviter API to python :)\n\n\nUnderstanding the PHP API\n-------------------------\n\nThere are tons of files, but ``plugins/_hosted.plg.php`` overwrites almost\neverything.\n\n\nHosted API\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- Post XML to http://hosted.openinviter.com/hosted/hosted.php.\n- ::\n\n    <import>\n      <service>{{ service }}</service>\n      <user>{$user}</user>\n      <password>{$pass}</password>\n    </import>\n\n- Authentication by private key, used to sign the XML with an md5 hash.\n- Supported services are requested and cached every now and then.\n\n\nTODO\n^^^^\n\n- Can't get hosted services lookup to work (`services()` function)\n- Contacts and services for a function name is ugly... import_contacts\n  might be better",
