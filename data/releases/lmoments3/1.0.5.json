    "description": "lmoments3\n=========\n\nA Python 3.x library to estimate linear moments for statistical distribution functions.\n\nRequires the packages `numpy` and `scipy`.\n\nFor the Python 2.x compatible package see `lmoments` on the Python Package Index.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nlmoments3 can be installed via `pip`\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install lmoments3\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation is available on `Read the Docs <http://lmoments3.readthedocs.io/latest>`_.\n\nSource code can be found at `GitHub <https://github.com/OpenHydrology/lmoments3>`_.\n\nOrigin\n------\n\nThis package contains a Python 3.x implementation of the lmoments.f library created by J. R. M. Hosking.

Hollebrandse\n<f.a.p.hollebrandse@protonmail.ch>.\n\nThe software remains licenced under the GNU General Public License, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\n\nThe Python 3 port, is based on the original `lmoments package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lmoments/0.2.2>`_, version\n0.2.2.\n\nThe Ouranosinc package was forked from `OpenHydrology's lmoments3 <https://github.com/OpenHydrology/lmoments3>`_. The primary aims of this fork are to provide maintenance for the existing codebase as well as update the project to benefit from more modern Python coding conventions, maintain compatibility with existing Python dependencies.\n",
