    "description": "# DonatelloPyzza\n\nA simple environment to help beginners learn Python in high school. \nA turtle can move through a grid and touch each cell until it finds the pizza.\n\nYou can manually create the grid world in which the turtle moves or generate it automatically (soon).\n\n# Documentation\n\nFirst, import the right modules to run the game:\n\n\n```python\nfrom donatellopyzza import Game\nfrom donatellopyzza import Action\nfrom donatellopyzza import Feedback\n```\n\n`Game` is a class that you will use to create a game instance. `Action` and `Feedback` define the different actions and feedbacks types. You can use the following actions in your code:\n\n    FORWARD -> make your turtle go one step forward\n    TURN_RIGHT -> your turtle will turn on its right\n    TURN_LEFT -> on its left\n    TOUCH -> the turtle will touch the cell in front of it to know its type\n\n\nDepending on your action, the game can provide you one of the following feedback:\n\n    COLLISION -> you just tried to walk in a wall !\n    MOVED -> you successfully moved\n    IS_ON_PIZZA -> your turtle is on the pizza (congratulation!)\n    TOUCHED_WALL -> you just touched a wall\n    TOUCHED_NOTHING -> the touched cell is empty (no wall, no pizza, you can walk on it)\n    TOUCHED_PIZZA -> the turtle touched the pizza\n\n\nNow you know how to play, let's create the game and its environment:\n\n```python\n# specify the name of the environment\n__ENVIRONMENT__ = \"maze\"\n# display the interface (or not)\n__GUI__ = True\n\ngame = Game(__ENVIRONMENT__, __GUI__)\n# returns a turtle that execute actions on its environment\nturtle = game.start()\n```\n\n\nOnce the game has started, you get a turtle instance which you can move around the board.\nTo do this, the following instruction can be used:\n\n```python\nfeedback = turtle.execute(Action.FORWARD)\nprint(feedback)\n```\n\nYou can use the feedback from the `execute()` method to see what happened after your action.\n\nFor more details, you can find several complete examples of the game loop in the `examples` folder on the github repository for this project.\n\n\nHave fun!\n",
