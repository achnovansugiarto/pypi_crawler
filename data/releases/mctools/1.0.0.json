    "description": "# Minecraft Connection Tools\nA python implementation for interacting with Minecraft servers.\n\n# Introduction\n\nmctools allows you to interact with Minecraft servers via [rcon](https://wiki.vg/RCON), \n[query](https://wiki.vg/Query), and [server list ping protocol](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping).\n\nThis allows you to the following:\n\n - Send and receive Minecraft server commands\n - Get player count(max and currently playing)\n - Get server version\n - Get the message of the day\n - Get currently installed plugins\n - And much more!\n\nAll of this can be achieved using simple, intuitive calls to mctools. mctools does all the heavy lifting for you!\nAlso, mctools has no external dependencies(Unless you are a windows user and need color support),\nand only uses the python standard library. Just download and go!\n\n# Example\n\nSend a command to the Minecraft server via rcon:\n\n    from mctools import RCONClient  # Import the RCONClient\n\n    HOST = 'mc.server.net'  # Hostname of the Minecraft server\n    PORT = 1234  # Port number of the RCON server\n\n    # Create the RCONClient:\n\n    rcon = RCONClient(HOST, port=PORT)\n\n    # Login to RCON:\n\n    if rcon.login(\"password\"):\n\n        # Send command to RCON - broadcast message to all players:\n\n        resp = rcon.command(\"broadcast Hello RCON!\")\n\n # Instillation\n\n You can install mctools via pip:\n\n    $ pip install mctools\n\n If you are a windows user and want color support, then install mctools like so:\n\n    $ pip install mctools[color]\n\n For more information on installing mctools, check out the instillation section in our \n [documentation](https://mctools.readthedocs.io/).\n\n # Formatting\n\n mctools has support for handling Minecraft formatting codes. \n You can decide weather mctools replaces formatting charcters with intended values, removes them, or leaves them be.\n\n For example, lets say you received the following content during a rcon session:\n\n    §e--------- §fHelp: Index (1/40) §e--------------------\n    §7Use /help [n] to get page n of help.\n    §6Aliases: §fLists command aliases\n    §6Bukkit: §fAll commands for Bukkit\n    §6ClearLag: §fAll commands for ClearLag\n    §6Essentials: §fAll commands for Essentials\n    §6LuckPerms: §fAll commands for LuckPerms\n    §6Minecraft: §fAll commands for Minecraft\n    §6Vault: §fAll commands for Vault\n    §6WorldEdit: §fAll commands for WorldEdit\n\n As you can see, this text is somewhat hard to read. If you told mctools to remove the formatting characters, \n then the output will look like this:\n\n    --------- Help: Index (1/40) --------------------\n    Use /help [n] to get page n of help.\n    Aliases: Lists command aliases\n    Bukkit: All commands for Bukkit\n    ClearLag: All commands for ClearLag\n    Essentials: All commands for Essentials\n    LuckPerms: All commands for LuckPerms\n    Minecraft: All commands for Minecraft\n    Vault: All commands for Vault\n    WorldEdit: All commands for WorldEdit\n\n Much easier to read and process. mctools handles this operation automatically, so you don't have to.\n mctools also handels situations where content is sent in ChatObject notation, and can extract messages from the \n player sample list.\n\n To learn more about formatters, and how to create your own, \n then please check out the [formatting documentation](https://mctools.readthedocs.io/).\n\n # Command line tool\n\n mctools is shipped with a CLI front end called mcli, which you can use to start rcon sessions, get stats\n via query/ping, check if a Minecraft server is up, ect. \n\n After installing mctools(through pip or setuptools), you can invoke mcli like so:\n\n    $ mcli --help\n\n You can also run mcli.py(which is located in the parent directory) if you downloaded the source code and did not\n install via pip/setuptools.\n\n This will generate the help menu for mcli. To learn more about mcli, please check out the \n [mcli documentation](https://mctools.readthedocs.io/).\n\n # Documentation\n\n mctools has an extensive documentation. It contains tutorials, the API reference, and best practice recommendations.\n You can find the [documentation here](https://mctools.readthedocs.io/).\n\n Be sure to also check out the [mctools PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/mctools/) for more information.\n\n # Conclusion\n\n mctools offers a pythonic, reliable way to interact with Minecraft servers, without being too complicated.\n If you have any questions or issues, then please open an issue. Pull requests of any kind a welcome and encouraged!\n\n Thank you for reading!\n\n",
