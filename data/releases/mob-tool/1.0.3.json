    "description": "# Mob-Tool\n\nMob-Tool is a command-line tool to manage mob programming sessions for teams working remotely. The tool helps the team\nto manage the session by controlling the timer and switching the driver role among the team members and also by\nsimplifying\nthe necessary Git commands to hand over the work to the next team member.\n\n\n> Mob programming is a development technique where a team of developers works together on the same task at the same\n> time.\n\n## What changes does the tool make to the repository?\n\n- **No changes are done in main branch.** All the changes are done in a new feature branch. You choose the name of the\n  branch\n  when you start the mob session.\n- **All Git command executed by the tool are logged in the output.** This way, the team can easily see what changes are\n  being done to their repository.\n- **All commands are rollback if any error occurs.** The commands to rollback are also logged in the output.\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\npip install mob-tool\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start a new mob programming session, with the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt start <branch-name>\n```\n\nSee below an example of the output of the `start` command:\n![Example of mobt start output](docs/start-output.png)\n\nWhen your time is up, the driver role to the next team member with the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt next\n```\n\nSee below an example of the output of the `next` command:\n![Example of mobt next output](docs/next-output.png)\n\nYou must call this command even if you didn't make any changes in the code so the mob tool can manage whose turn is\nnext. The next drive (in this example, Erik) can start working by running the same `mobt start <branch-name>` command:\n\nWhen your feature is ready, you can end the mob programming session with the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt done\n```\n\nIt will squash all the commits, and push all the changes to the remote. All git hooks will be executed for this final\ncommit. The hooks are always ignored during for the `start` and `next` commands.\n\nSee below an example of the output of the `done` command:\n![Example of mobt done output](docs/done-output.png)\n\n### Output example with rollback\n\n![Example of output with rollback](docs/rollback-example.png)\n",
