    "description": "# Mob-Tool: `mobt`\n\nMob-Tool is a command-line tool designed to facilitate mob programming sessions for remote teams. The tool provides\nseveral features to help teams manage their sessions, including controlling the timer, switching the driver\nrole among team members, and simplifying the necessary Git commands to hand over the work to the next team member.\n\n> Mob programming is a software development approach where a team of developers works together on the same task at the\n> same time.\n\n## What changes does the tool make to the repository?\n\n- **No changes are made in the `main` branch:** All changes are made in a new feature branch, and you can choose the\n  name of the branch when you start the mob session.\n- **All Git commands executed by the tool are logged in the output:** This way, the team can easily see what changes are\n  being made to their repository.\n- **All commands are rolled back if any error occurs:** The commands to rollback are also logged in the output.\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\npip install mob-tool\n```\n\n**Important!**\n> Please note that some operating systems might be equipped with the `python3` and `pip3` commands instead of `python`\n> and `pip` (but they should be equivalent). If you donâ€™t have `pip` or `pip3` available in your system, please check\n> out [pip installation docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting a new session\n\nTo start a new session, use the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt start <branch-name>\n```\n\nHere's an example of the output of the `start` command:\n![Example of mobt start output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stavarengo/mob-tool/main/docs/start-output.png)\n\n### Handing over to the next driver\n\nWhen your time is up, pass the driver role to the next team member with the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt next\n```\n\nHere's an example of the output of the `next` command:\n![Example of mobt next output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stavarengo/mob-tool/main/docs/next-output.png)\n\nNote that you must call `mob next` even if you didn't make any changes in the code, so the Mob-Tool can manage whose\nturn is next.\n\nThe next driver (in this example, Erik) can start working by running the same `mobt start <branch-name>` command.\n\n### Finishing the session when the feature is done\n\nWhen your feature is ready, you can end the session with the following command:\n\n```shell\nmobt done\n```\n\nThis will squash all the commits and push all the changes to the remote. All Git hooks will be executed for this final\ncommit. The hooks are always ignored during the `start` and `next` commands.\n\nHere's an example of the output of the `done` command:\n![Example of mobt done output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stavarengo/mob-tool/main/docs/done-output.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What happens if one of the Git commands fails?\n\nIf one of the Git commands fails, all changes made to the repository are rolled back. Here's an example of the output\nwith a rollback in action:\n![Example of output with rollback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stavarengo/mob-tool/main/docs/rollback-example.png)\n",
