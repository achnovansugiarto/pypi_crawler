    "description": "\n***********\nMetabolinks\n***********\n\n``Metabolinks`` is a Python package that provides a set of tools for high-resolution\nMS metabolomics data analysis.\n\nMetabolinks aims at providing several tools that streamline most of\nthe metabolomics workflow. These tools were written having ultra-high\nresolution MS based metabolomics in mind.\n\nFeatures are a bit scarce right now:\n\n- peak list alignment\n- common metabolomics data-matrix preprocessing, based on ``pandas`` and ``scikit-learn``\n- compound taxonomy retrieval\n\nBut our road map is clear and we expect to stabilize in a beta version pretty soon.\n\nStay tuned, and check out the examples folder (examples are provided as\njupyter notebooks).\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\n``Metabolinks`` is distributed on PyPI_ and can be installed with pip on\na Python 3.6+ installation::\n\n   pip install metabolinks\n\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/metabolinks\n\n\nHowever, even if ``Metabolinks`` is written in Python, it requires some of the powerful scientific\npackages that are pre-installed on \"Scientific/Data Science Python\" distributions.\n\nOne of these two products is highly recommended:\n\n- `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ (or `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ followed by the necessary ``conda install``'s)\n- `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_\n\nThe formal requirements are:\n\n- Python 3.6 and above\n- ``setuptools``, ``pip``, ``requests``, ``pandas-flavor`` and ``pytest``\n\nFrom the Python scientific ecossystem:\n\n- ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``, ``pandas`` and ``scikit-learn``\n\nThe installation of the ``Jupyter`` platform is also recommended since\nthe examples are provided as *Jupyter notebooks*.\n\n\n\n",
