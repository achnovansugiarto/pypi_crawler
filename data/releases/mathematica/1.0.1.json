It includes modules for calculating mean, standard deviation & probability distribution function of various statistical distributions. The latest released stable version of elxsi is v1.0.4\n\nThis project was started in 2021 by [Ashwin Raj](https://www.github.com/thisisashwinraj), as an academic project. The resources for this package, and the pull requests are maintained, and reviewed by a team of volunteers from [Workspace](https://github.com/workspacedevelopers). Learn more about elxsi v1.0.4 [here](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2021/showcase/436)\n\n\n# SubDirectories and Dependencies\n### Dependencies\n- Python (>= 3.9.0) - Learn more about the python programming from [here](https://www.python.org/), and download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- NumPy (>=1.20.3) - Learn about the NumPy package [here](https://numpy.org/), and install the package following the guidelines [here](https://numpy.org/install/)\n\n**Note:**\nElxsi runs on all operating systems, is quick to install, and is available for free use. No versions of Elxsi supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4. Elxsi's plotting capabiliies requires [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (>= 2.1.1) and seaborn (>= 0.9.0) packages.\n\n### Files and Folders\nThe directories, and subdirectories used, that are of critical importance to the Elxsi python package are as mentioned:\n- [dist](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/dist): This sub-directory contains the entire source distribution for the package that needs to be uploaded to PyPi\n- [elxsi.egg-info](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/elxsi.egg-info): This subdirectory contains the entire package's metadata, including a PKG-INGFO, and the sources\n- [elxsi](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/tree/main/elxsi): This subdirectory contains the entire code for performing operations and visualizing statistical distributions\n\n# Python Package Build Commands\nTo install the elxsi python package, just run the following command to create an .egg file (python distribution format):\n```\npython setup.py bdist_egg\n```\nTo create raw source distribution file for this package, run the following command in your command prompt/terminal:\n```\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\nRunning this file creates the following sub-directories: dist, and elxsi.egg-info. Executable installer can also be created for installing the package in the Microsoft Windows environment. \nTo create an executable installer, run this command:\n```\npython setup.py bdist_wininst\n```\n# User Installation and Source Code\nLatest stable release of elxsi can either be downloaded from the repo or be simply installed from PyPi, using the code:\n```\npip install elxsi\n```\nOnce this package has succesfully installed, a large array of different statistical distributions can be imported from the package by specifying the name of the distribution (seprated by a ','), with first letter of each word typed in uppercase\n\n![pip install elxsi](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package/blob/main/doc/gifs/elxsiReadmeGIF.gif)\n\nElxsi development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Elxsi-Mathematical-Python-Package).
