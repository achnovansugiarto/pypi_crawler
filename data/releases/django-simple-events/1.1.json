    "description": "Overview\n--------\n\n``django-simple-events`` lets you bind your models to events. This events have the\nfollowing configuration options:\n\n- beginning\n- time\n- frecuency: single time, daily, weekly, montly, yearly\n- interval: times between frecuencies\n- repetitions\n- end\n\nThe event occurrences are stored in the DB when an event gets saved. If you don't \nspecify a maximum repetitions number or the end datetime, the event occurrences are \nupdated periodically with the ``update_occurrences`` command.\n\nInstalation\n-----------\n\nAdd ``events`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'events',\n        ...\n        )\n\nSet ``EVENTS_MAX_FUTURE_OCCURRENCES`` to indicate the maximum of future occurrences to\nrecolect in the DB if an event is endless ::\n\n    EVENTS_MAX_FUTURE_OCCURRENCES = 50\n\nYou can also set ``EVENTS_MAX_PAST_OCCURRENCES``\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIn the following examples we are going to relate ``Study`` objects to events.\n\nModels\n~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to access from ``Study`` the events, it's recommendable to add a \ngeneric relation ::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic\n    from events.models import Event\n\n    class Study(models.Model):\n        ...\n        events = generic.GenericRelation(Event)\n        ...\n\n\nAPI\n~~~\n\nGet the events related to a ``Study``::\n\n    study = Study.objects.get(pk=1)\n    study.events.all()\n\nAdd an event to a ``Study``::\n    \n    from events.models import Event\n    from datetime import date, time\n\n    study = Study.objects.get(pk=1)\n    event = Event(date.today(), time.now())\n\n    event.related_object = study\n    event.save()\n\n    study.events.get(pk=event.pk)\n\nPlay with the occurrences of an event::\n    \n    from events.models import Event\n\n    event = Event.objects.get(pk=1)\n    \n    #get all the occurrences as an iter of datetimes\n    event.get_occurrences()\n\n    #get all of past occurrences as a list of datetimes\n    event.get_past_occurrences()\n\n    #get the last 20 past occurrences as a list of datetimes\n    event.get_past_occurrences(20)\n\n    #get the next 20 future occurrences as a list of datetimes\n    event.get_future_occurrences(20)\n\n    #update the Occurrence objects of an event\n    event.update_occurrences(event.get_occurrences)\n\n    #get the Occurrence objects of an event\n    event.occurrence_set.all()\n\n    #get all the Study objects that have occurrences in the future\n    from datetime import datetime\n    Study.objects.filter(events__occurrence__datetime__gt=datetime.now())\n\nAdmin\n~~~~~\n\nIf, when you are editing a ``Study`` in admin, you want to also edit the\nrelated events, you are easilly done::\n\n    from django.contrib import admin\n\n    from events.admin import EventInline\n\n    class StudyAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n        ...\n        inlines = EventInline,\n        ...\n    admin.site.register(Study, StudyAdmin)\n\nForms\n~~~~~\n\nYou can also use the event form::\n\n    from events.forms import EventForm",
