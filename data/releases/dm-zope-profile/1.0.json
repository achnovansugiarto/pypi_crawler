    "description": "The package allows the profiling of Zope applications.\nIt is the successor of ``Products.ZopeProfiler`` for ``Zope>=4``.\nIt uses Python's standard profiling support from its runtime\nlibrary  modules ``cProfile`` and ``pstats`` and integrates it with ``Zope``.\nRead the corresponding documentation to learn how to interact with\nand interpret the collected profiling information.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install this package in the same way as you have installed\n``Zope``, i.e. either via ``pip`` or via ``buildout``.\n\nEnsure that its ``configure.zcml`` gets executed on startup.\nIt defines request subscribers to collect profiling data\nand the page ``@@profile`` to manage profiling or present collected data.\n\n\nProfiling\n=========\n\nWhen you start a ``Zope`` instance, profiling is disabled.\nYou can enable the collection of profiling data via\nthe page ``@@profile``. This page also allows you to configure\nthe profiling and present the collected data in various\nalternative ways.\n\nThe configuration is split into 2 parts: the ``Profiler`` part\ncontrols the collection of profiling base data, the ``Statistics`` part\ncontrols how this information is presented.\n\nThe ``Profiler`` configuration allows you to specify which timer\n(real time or CPU time) is used for profiling and\nwhich requests should be profiled. For the latter task,\nyou can define 2 collections of regular expressions: ``include``\nand ``exclude``. A request is not profiled if any regular expression\nin ``exclude`` matches; if ``include`` is not empty, then a\nrequest is only profiled if it matches at least one of those.\nMatching is always performed in search mode on the request's\n``PATH_INFO``. When you change the timer, the\ncollected profiling data is cleared.\n\nThe ``Statistics`` configuration essentially provides parameters\nfor Python's ``pstats``.\nEspecially, you can select various views (``stats``, ``caller``, ``callee``),\nsort according to various criteria (e.g. ``cumulative``, ``internal``, ...),\nstrip directory information and control the amount of data shown.\nRead the Python documentation for ``pstats`` to get details.\n\nNote that profiling usually does not see thread switches.\nThis is always the case when you use a real time timer\nand can also be the case with a CPU time timer (e.g. for Python 2\nor on Windows). In those cases, time spend in a foreign thread\nmay be wrongly accounted for a profiled request. You may\nconsider configuring Zope to use a single worker thread\nto reduce this problem.\n\nNote that both configuration and collected profiling data\nis maintained in process memory; i.e. in a multi instance\nZope installation, each instance has its own private data.\n\nNote that profiling reveals important implementation details.\nYou should take appropriate measures to avoid that it can be\naccessed by a hacker. One option is to\nmake it only available in development installations behind a firewall.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n``dm.zope.profile`` maintains its configuration in RAM.\nAs a consequence, configuration changes are lost when the process\nis shut down.\nYou can define the initial configuration on start up via ZCML. \nFor this purpose, the package's ``meta.zcml`` defines the\ndirective ``config`` in namespace\n``http://namespaces.zope.org/dm.zope.profile``.\n\nThe configuration uses options with either simple values\n(``timer``, ``type`` and ``strip_dirs``) or collection values\n(``include``, ``exclude``, ``sort_by``, ``restrictions``).\nOptions with simple values are specified via attributes of\nthe ``config`` directive. Individual elements of collection\nvalues are specified via ``element`` subdirectives.\nThose subdirectives specify the option they provide a partial value for\nvia their ``name`` attribute and their contribution\nvia their ``value`` attribute.\n\n``example_config.zcml`` contains an example. It recreates the\ncode defined default conflguration (and thus serves only as an\na demontration).\n\nNote:\nCurrently, you cannot omit options in order to inherit them from the\nthe code defined default configuration: if the ``config`` directive\nis used, then the code defined default configuration becomes\ncompletely irrelevant. This might change in the future.",
