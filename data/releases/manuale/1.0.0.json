    "description": "# ManuaLE\n\nmanuale is a fully manual [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)/[ACME](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/) client for advanced users. It is intended to be used by a human in a manual workflow and contains no automation features whatsoever.\n\n## Why?\n\nIsn't the point of Let's Encrypt to be automatic and seamless? Maybe, but here's some reasons:\n\n* You're not comfortable with an automatic process handling something as critical, or your complex infrastructure doesn't allow it in the first place.\n\n* You already have perfect configuration management with something like Ansible. Renewing is a matter of dropping in a new certificate. With a manual client that works, it's literally a minute of work.\n\n* You want the traditional and authentic SSL installation experience of copying files you don't understand to your server, searching for configuration instructions and praying that it works.\n\n## Features\n\n* Simple interface with no hoops to jump through. Keys and certificate signing requests are automatically generated: no more cryptic OpenSSL one-liners. (However, you do need to know what to do with generated certificates and keys yourself!)\n\n* Support for DNS validation. No need to figure out how to serve challenge files from a live domain. (In fact, that's the only validation method supported).\n\n* Authorization is separate from certificate issuance. Authorizations last for months on Let's Encrypt: there's no need to waste time validating the domain every time you renew the certificate.\n\n* Obviously, runs without root access. Use it from any machine you want, it doesn't care. Internet connection recommended.\n\n* Awful, undiscoverable name.\n\n* And finally, if the `openssl` binary is your spirit animal after all, you can still bring your own keys and/or CSR's. Everybody wins.\n\n## Installation\n\nGet it from your package manager if available. If not, install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/manuale) with `pip3 install manuale`.\n\nOr live on the edge with the git repository:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/veeti/manuale ~/.manuale\n    cd ~/.manuale\n    python3 -m venv env\n    env/bin/python setup.py install\n    ln -s env/bin/manuale ~/.bin/\n\nPython 3.3 or above is required.\n\n## Quick start\n\nRegister an account (once):\n\n    $ manuale register me@example.com\n\nAuthorize one or more domains:\n\n    $ manuale authorize example.com\n    DNS verification required. Make sure these records are in place:\n      _acme-challenge.example.com. \"(some random gibberish)\"\n    Press enter to continue.\n    ...\n    1 domain(s) authorized. Let's Encrypt!\n\nGet your certificate:\n\n    $ manuale issue --output certs/ example.com\n    ...\n    Certificate issued.\n\n    Expires: 2016-06-01\n     SHA256: (more random gibberish)\n\n    Wrote key to certs/example.com.pem\n    Wrote certificate to certs/example.com.crt\n    Wrote certificate with intermediate to certs/example.com.chain.crt\n    Wrote intermediate certificate to certs/example.com.intermediate.crt\n\nSet yourself a reminder for renewal!\n\n## Usage\n\nYou need to create an account once. To do so, call `manuale register [email]`. This will create a new account key for you. Follow the registration instructions.\n\nOnce that's done, you'll have your account saved in `account.json` in the current directory. You'll need this to do anything useful. Oh, and it contains your private key, so keep it safe and secure.\n\n`manuale` expects the account file to be in your working directory by default, so you'll probably want to make a specific directory to do all your certificate stuff in. Likewise, created certificates get saved in the current path by default.\n\nNext up, verify the domains you want a certificate for with `manuale authorize [domain]`. This will show you the DNS records you need to create and wait for you to do it. For example, you might do it for `example.com` and `www.example.com`.\n\nOnce that's done, you can finally get down to business. Run `manuale issue example.com www.example.com` to get your certificate. It'll save the key, certificate and certificate with intermediate to the working directory.\n\nThere's plenty of documentation inside each command. Run `manuale -h` for a list of commands and `manuale [command] -h` for details.\n\n## See also\n\n* [Best practices for server configuration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)\n* [Configuration generator for common servers](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/)\n* [Test your server](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)\n* [Other clients](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/list-of-client-implementations/2103)\n\n## License\n\n**The MIT License (MIT)**\n\nCopyright Â© 2016 Veeti Paananen\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
