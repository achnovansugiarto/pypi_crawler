    "description": "# XBRL US Data Quality Committee Rules\n\ndqc_us_rules is a plugin for Arelle\n\n## dqc_us_rules contains:\n\n* Final rules that the XBRL US Data Quality Committee approved for public release\n* Draft rules that the XBRL US Data Quality Committee approved to expose for public comment\n* Reference implementation of the rules, using Arelle as an XBRL processor\n* Unit tests for the reference implementation\n* Test suite\n\n## Deployment\n\n* Deploy with Arelle\n* Specify the sec directory as a plugin with Arelle\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Python 3.x (3.2 or greater is preferred)\n* Git 1.7+\n* C compiler toolchain (for LXML)\n* libxml2 (also for LXML)\n* Arelle\n\n## Development\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one uses a python virtual environment, such as [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/), to do development.  To make development and management of virtual environments easier, we recommend checking out [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n\nThe rest of this setup will assume you have installed [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n\n### Creating a virtual environment\n\nTo create a virtual environment, change your directory to the root of this project, and execute the following command:\n\n    mkvirtualenv dqc -a $PWD -p <path_to_python3>\n\nThis will give you a virtual environment that you can then work within by inputting\n\n    workon dqc\n\nany time you need to work in it.\n\n### Installing dependencies\n\nTo install the dependencies for development of only the DQC ruleset, you will use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) to install the requirements.  Install Arelle as a package first\n\n    pip install -r arelle-requirements.txt\n\nWhen that is finished, then install the remainder of the development requirements\n\n    pip install dev-requirements.txt\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nTo run the unit tests, simply run the included shell script\n\n    ./run-unit-tests.sh\n\n### Running test suite\n\nSee documentation in the test suite\n\n## Rule Index\n\nThe rule definition index is [here](docs/README.md).\n\n## Change Management\n\nWe actively accept, and encourage, pull requests for code changes.  An explanation of the change is required, and the request will be reviewed by the technical leads of the project.  If the request is accepted it will be merged into the master branch. Some requests may require Committee approval which may take longer to implement.  If the request is found to be missing parts or is otherwise incomplete, comments will be noted regarding the missing or incomplete parts.\n\n## License\n\nSee [License](License.md) for license information.\nSee [Patent Notice](PatentNotice.md) for patent infringement notice.\n\nCopyright 2015, XBRL US Inc, All rights reserved",
