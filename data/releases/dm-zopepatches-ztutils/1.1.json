    "description": "This package patches Zope's ``ZTUtils`` to enhance its ``make_query`` and\n``make_hidden_input`` functions. Those functions are used to pass values across\ntwo requests and allow the target request to get the value in approximately\nthe same way (e.g. in the same type) as it has been in the source request,\navoiding tedious fixups in the target request.\n\nThe standard Zope versions are quite limited. They support\n(binary) strings, integers, floats and ``DateTime.DateTime`` as\nelementary data types and lists and namespaces (i.e. something\nwith an ``items`` method) of those elemantary types for structured\nvalues.\n\nThis package replaces Zope's ``ZTUtils.Zope.complex_marshal`` by a variant\nthat correctly handles unicode and tuples. In addition, empty lists\n(and tuples) are retained. Tuples are marshalled as lists. This\npatch makes \"make_query\" and \"make_hidden_input\" more reliable.\n\nFrom version 1.1 on, the application can register extensions\nto support additional elementary data types or to support\npassing structured values which are more deeply nested. For details,\nplease see the docstrings of class ``Extension`` and the functions\n``register_extension`` and ``unregister_extension``.\n\nBy default, the extension framework is used to register\nan extension handling ``None`` values. Note that this changes\nthe behavior for ``None`` passing relative to pre 1.1 versions.\nUse ``unregister_extension(\"none\")`` to keep the old behavior.\n\nThe extension framework is used to define the function\n``register_json_extension``.\nIt uses JSON marshalling to represent subvalues in\nstructured data which are too deeply nested to be handled by\nbasic mashalling. Should you need customization\nfor the JSON marshalling, take the implementation of\n``register_json_extension`` as a blueprint for your own definition.\n\n\nVersion history\n===============\n\n1.1\n\n   Extension framework to optionnaly support application specific\n   handling of new data types and deeper data structures\n\n   ``None`` is (by default) passed on as the object ``None`` not as\n   the string ``\"None\"``.\n\n1.0\n\n   Lets ``make_query`` and ``make_hidden_inputs``\n   reliably handle unicode, tuples and empty lists.",
