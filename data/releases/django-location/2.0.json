Do you track\nyour runs or bike commutes with\n`Runmeter <http://www.abvio.com/runmeter/>`__? Do you use an IOS device?\nWhy let third-party interfaces be your only window into your day-to-day\nmovements?\n\nThis Django application will consume location information provided by\nFoursquare, iCloud, and, if you happen to be a user of it, Runmeter, and\nstore it in your database for display at will.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can either install from pip::\n\n    pip install django-location\n\n*or* checkout and install the source from the `bitbucket\nrepository <https://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-location>`__::\n\n    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-location\n    cd django-location\n    python setup.py install\n\n*or* checkout and install the source from the `github\nrepository <https://github.com/latestrevision/django-location>`__::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/latestrevision/django-location.git\n    cd django-location\n    python setup.py install\n\nYou'll want to add both django-social-auth and django-location to your\nproject's ``urls.py``; you can technically use whatever URL you'd like,\nbut for the purposes of the instructions below, we'll expect that you'll\nadd them like::\n\n    url(r'^location/', include('location.urls')),\n    url(r'', include('social_auth.urls')),\n\nRecommended Extra Packages\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEach point gathered will also be able to provide to you what\nneighborhood and city it is in if the following two packages are\ninstalled:\n\n-  `django-neighborhoods <http://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-neighborhoods/>`__\n-  `django-census-places <http://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-census-places/>`__\n\nIf you'd like to consume Runmeter information, you'll need:\n\n-  `django-mailbox <http://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-mailbox/>`__\n   (for reading incoming e-mail messages sent from the Runmeter app)\n\nDisplaying Location Using a Template Tag\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou can use the ``current_location`` template tag to gather the most\nrecent location for a given user.\n\nSimple example::\n\n    {% load current_location %}\n    {% current_location of 'adam' as location_of_adam %}\n\n    <p>\n        {{ location_of_adam.user.username }} is at {{ location_of_adam.location.coords.1 }}, {{ location_of_adam.location.coords.0 }}\n    </p>\n\nIf you have installed 'django-neighborhoods' and 'django-census-places',\nyou can also print city and neighborhood information::\n\n    {% load current_location %}\n    {% current_location of 'adam' as location_of_adam %}\n\n    <p>\n        {{ location_of_adam.user.username }} is in the {{ location_of_adam.neighborhood.name }} neighborhood of {{ location_of_adam.city.name }}, {{ location_of_adam.city.get_state_display }}.\n    </p>\n\nYou might not always have neighborhood or city information for a given\npoint, and maybe you would like to display a map using the Google Maps\nAPI; here's a fleshed-out version::\n\n    {% load current_location %}\n    <script src=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n    {% current_location of 'somebody' as location %}\n    {{ location.user.username }} is\n    {% if location.neighborhood %}\n        in the {{ location.neighborhood.name }} neighborhood of {{ location.neighborhood.city }},\n        {{ location.neighborhood.state }}:\n    {% elif location.city %}\n        in {{ location.city.name }}, {{ location.city.get_state_display }}:\n    {% else %}\n        ({{ location.get_nearest_city.distance.mi }} miles from {{ location.get_nearest_city.name }}):\n    {% endif %}\n    <div id=\"my_location_map\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px;\"></div>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var myLocation = document.getElementById('my_location_map');\n        myLocation.gmap({\n            'center': '{{ location.location.coords.1 }},{{ location.location.coords.0 }}',\n            'zoom': 10,\n            'mapTypeId': google.maps.MapTypeId.HYBRID\n        });\n        myLocation.gmap('addMarker', {\n            'position': '{{ location.location.coords.1 }},{{ location.location.coords.0 }}',\n        });\n    </script>\n\nLocation Sources\n----------------\n\nFor some of the below consumers, iCloud and Runmeter specifically, you will\nneed to set up a cron job that will handle certain periodic tasks, you can\ndo this by adding a cron job running::\n\n    python /path/to/your/manage.py location_consumer\n\nI'd suggest running this at five or ten minute intervals, but selecting longer\nintervals will have only minor effects; either reducing sample frequency \n(in the case of the iCloud consumer) or increasing update latency (in the\ncase of the Runmeter consumer).\n\nFoursquare\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`Foursquare <http://foursquare.com/>`__ has options in its consumer\nsettings to allow it to instantly post check-in information to an API\nendpoint that this application provides. To support that, you'll need to\ndo the following:\n\n1. Go to the `Foursquare developer\n   site <http://developer.foursquare.com/>`__ and create a new consumer.\n\n   -  Enter the callback URL for django-social-auth's Foursquare backend\n      (generally http://yourdomain.com/complete/foursquare/).\n   -  Turn on Push API notifications ('Push checkins by this consumer's\n      users').\n   -  Enter the push URL for the django-location app (usually\n      https://yourdomain.com/location/foursquare/). Note: Foursquare\n      requires that the connection be made via HTTPs.\n\n2. Configure the following settings::\n\n       FOURSQUARE_CONSUMER_KEY = \"THECLIENTIDYOUJUSTGENERATED\"\n       FOURSQUARE_CONSUMER_SECRET  = \"THECLIENTSECRETYOUJUSTGENERATED\"\n\n3. Go to the configuration URL for the django-location app (usually\n   http://yourdomain.com/admin/location/locationsource/configure-accounts/)\n   while logged-in to the admin, and click on the 'Authorize Foursquare'\n   button. This will bring you to Foursquare's site using your\n   configured options, and authorize your web application to receive\n   check-ins from the user with which you log-into Foursquare.\n4. If everything is set-up, you shouldn't need to do anything more, but\n   Foursquare does offer a 'Send a test push' button on their consumer\n   console that you can use to verify that everything is properly\n   connected.\n\nRunmeter\n~~~~~~~~\n\n`Runmeter <http://www.abvio.com/runmeter/>`__ does not provide an API,\nbut does allow you to configure the application to send out e-mail\nnotifications when you begin (and finish, etc) your run, bike, or\nanything else. To consume information from Runmeter, we'll configure it\nto e-mail to an otherwise-unused e-mail inbox (important), and configure\ndjango-location to consume those e-mail messages and extract coordinates\nfrom the linked-to KML file.\n\n1. Configure the Runmeter application to send start and finish\n   notifications to a mailbox accessible by POP3 or IMAP.\n2. Set-up Django Mailbox to consume mail from such a mailbox (consult\n   `django-mailbox's\n   documentation <http://bitbucket.org/latestrevision/django-mailbox/>`__).\n3. Update users' Location Consumer Settings record to set the field \n   ``runmeter_email`` to match the e-mail address from which a user's device\n   will be sending Runmeter updates.\n\niCloud\n~~~~~~\n\n`iCloud <https://www.icloud.com/>`__ provides a service named 'Find my iPhone'\nthat allows you to request your device's location at-will.  This library\nprovides you with an easy way to use this service's location information\nas one of your location sources.\n\n1. Identify the devices associated with your account, you can\n   do that by using the ``list_icloud_devices`` management command::\n\n    python /path/to/your/manage.py list_icloud_devices <icloud username> <icloud password>\n\n   replacing ``<icloud username>`` and ``<icloud password>`` with your\n   iCloud username and password.\n   \n   This will print a list of devices and their IDs; in my case, it prints\n   something like this::\n\n    Name: MacBook Air 11\": sinclair -- ID: reGYDh9XwqNWTGIhNBuEwP1ds0F/Lg5t/fxNbZ3V939hhXawByErk+HYVNSUzmWV\n    Name: iPhone 4S: Adam Coddingtons iPhone -- ID: i9vbKRGIcLYqJnXMc1b257kUWnoyEBcEh6yM+IfmiMLh7BmOpALU+w==\n\n2. Update users' Location Consumer Settings records to include the user's\n   ``iCloud username``, ``iCloud password``, and ``iCloud device ID`` from\n   which you would like to gather location information.\n",
