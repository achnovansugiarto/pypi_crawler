    "description": "=====================\nDjango MarkWhat\n=====================\n\n.. note::\n\n    Extracted from `Django 1.4 since markup deprecation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.5/#django-contrib-markup>`_\n\n------\n\nA collection of template filters that implement common markup languages.\n\nprovides template filters that implement the following markup\nlanguages:\n\n* ``textile`` -- implements `Textile`_ -- requires `PyTextile`_\n* ``markdown`` -- implements `Markdown`_ -- requires `Python-markdown`_\n* ``restructuredtext`` -- implements `reST (reStructured Text)`_\n  -- requires `doc-utils`_\n\nIn each case, the filter expects formatted markup as a string and\nreturns a string representing the marked-up text. For example, the\n``textile`` filter converts text that is marked-up in Textile format\nto HTML.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n``django-markwhat`` is available on pypi:\n\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-markwhat\n\nSo easily install it by ``pip``:\n::\n    \n    pip install django-markwhat\n\nOr by ``easy_install``\n::\n    \n    $ easy_install django-markwhat\n\nAnother way is by cloning ``django-markwhat``'s `git repo <https://github.com/Alir3z4/django-markwhat>`_ :::\n    \n    git clone git://github.com/Alir3z4/django-markwhat.git\n\nThen install it by running:\n::\n    \n    $ python setup.py install\n\nConfiguration\n******************\n\nTo activate these filters, add ``'django_markwhat'`` to your\n``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. Once you've done that, use\n``{% load markup %}`` in a template, and you'll have access to these filters.\n\n.. warning::\n\n    The output of markup filters is marked \"safe\" and will not be escaped when\n    rendered in a template. Always be careful to sanitize your inputs and make\n    sure you are not leaving yourself vulnerable to cross-site scripting or\n    other types of attacks.\n\n.. _Textile: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29\n.. _Markdown: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\n.. _reST (reStructured Text): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText\n.. _PyTextile: http://loopcore.com/python-textile/\n.. _Python-markdown: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown\n.. _doc-utils: http://docutils.sf.net/\n\nreStructured Text\n-----------------\n\nWhen using the ``restructuredtext`` markup filter you can define a\n`RESTRUCTUREDTEXT_FILTER_SETTINGS` in your django settings to\noverride the default writer settings. See the `restructuredtext writer\nsettings`_ for details on what these settings are.\n\n.. warning::\n\n   reStructured Text has features that allow raw HTML to be included, and that\n   allow arbitrary files to be included. These can lead to XSS vulnerabilities\n   and leaking of private information. It is your responsibility to check the\n   features of this library and configure appropriately to avoid this. See the\n   `Deploying Docutils Securely\n   <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/security.html>`_ documentation.\n\n.. _restructuredtext writer settings: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/config.html#html4css1-writer\n\nMarkdown\n--------\n\nThe Python Markdown library supports options named \"safe_mode\" and\n\"enable_attributes\". Both relate to the security of the output. To enable both\noptions in tandem, the markdown filter supports the \"safe\" argument.\n::\n    \n    { markdown_content_var|markdown:\"safe\" }}\n\n.. warning::\n\n    Versions of the Python-Markdown library prior to 2.1 do not support the\n    optional disabling of attributes and by default",
