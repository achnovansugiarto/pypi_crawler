    "description": "=======\nmlbgame\n=======\n\nmlbgame is a Python API to retrieve and read MLB GameDay XML data.\nmlbgame works with real time data, getting information as games are being played.\n\nmlbgame uses the same data that MLB GameDay uses,\nand therefore is updated as soon as something happens in a game.\n\nmlbgame currently comes pre-loaded with every game\nfrom 2012 to the end of the 2015 season,\nbut will be updated regularly during the season.\nTherefore, accessing this data does not actually make a request to mlb.com.\n\nIf you try to get data from a game that is not cached,\nmlbgame will download the data from mlb.com.\n\nThere are a lot of extra data for individual games that do not come\npre-installed with mlbgame, but can be installed by running update scripts\nshown below. This data is not included becuase it takes up too much space, \nand therefore a request to mlb.com every time is a better option \nbecause not everyone will want to access this data.\n\nmlbgame `documentation <http://zachpanz88.github.io/mlbgame>`__\n\nmlbgame on `Github <https://github.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame>`__  (Source Code)\n\nIf you have a question or need help, the quickest way to get a response \nis to file an issue on the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame/issues/new>`__\n\nmlbgame's submodules (except for ``statmap``) should not really be used other than as \nused by the main functions of the package (in ``__init__.py``).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nmlbgame is in the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlbgame/>`__.\nInstalling with ``pip`` is recommended for all systems.\n\nmlbgame can be installed by running:\n\n::\n\n    pip install mlbgame\n\nAlternatively, the latest release of mlbgame can be downloaded as a \n`zip <https://github.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame/archive/master.zip>`__ or \n`tarball <https://github.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame/archive/master.tar.gz>`__.\nIf you do not install with ``pip``, you must also install `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`__ for mlbgame to work.\n\nUpdating the Game Database\n--------------------------\n\nSince games happen every day, new game data exists that is not stored on disk from the original install.\nThe database can be updated by running the following command:\n\n::\n\n    mlbgame-update\n\nThere are some optional arguments that will cache extra data that is not included with the original install.\nThis extra data may take up a lot of disk space, so only cache if you really need it (it will make processes much faster).\nIf this data is not cached, mlbgame will make a request to mlb.com every time you try to access the data.\n\n::\n\n    usage: mlbgame-update <arguments>\n    \n    Arguments:\n    --help (-h): display this help menu\n    --hide: hides output from update script\n    --stats: saves the box scores and individual game stats from every game\n    --events: saves the game events from every game\n    --overview: saves the game overview from every game\n    --start (-s) <MM-DD-YYYY>: date to start updating from (default: 01-01-2012)\n    --end (-e) <MM-DD-YYYY>: date to update until (default: current day)\n\nUse of mlbgame must follow the terms stated in the \n`license <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachpanz88/mlbgame/master/LICENSE>`__ \nand on `mlb.com <http://gd2.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt>`__",
