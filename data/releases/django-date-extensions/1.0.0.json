    "description": "django-date-extensions\nby Matthew Somerville\n\nThis code adds a few small extensions to Django's DateField, to handle both\napproximate dates (e.g. \"March 1963\") and default year dates (e.g. assume\n\"24th June\" is the most recent such).\n\nexample contains a hopefully self-contained Django project that simply shows\noff a form with these methods of entry.\n\nApproximate dates\n=================\n\nA new object, ApproximateDate, is used to represent dates that might not have a\nmonth or a day. ApproximateDateField is the model field used to represent these\nobjects in a Model, and ApproximateDateFormField is the field used in a Django\nform. Everything should work seamlessly simply by specifying a model field as\nApproximateDateField rather than DateField.\n\nDefault year dates\n==================\n\nPrettyDateField is a form field to be used on DateField model fields. It takes\none argument, future, which is a nullable boolean. If True, a date input that\nis missing a year will be taken to be the next possible occurrence of that date\n- e.g. on 24th November 2009, entering 24th December will be taken to be\n2009-12-24, whilst entering 3rd March will be taken to be 2010-03-03. If future\nis False, the reverse occurs, with year-less dates being assumed to be the\nclosest occurrence of that date in the past.\n\nIf future is not set, then PrettyDateField acts the same as a DateField, only\nallows suffixes on ordinals, and assumes D/M/Y rather than M/D/Y. \n\nTodo\n====\n\nImprove date parsing to take more inputs like my traintimes.org.uk PHP, such as\n\"next Friday\".\n\n\nAny queries or comments, do get in touch. Something's probably broken, as I tried\nto tidy up the code a little for public release :)\n\nMatthew Somerville.",
