    "description": "**Multi-Agent Accelerator for Data Science Using Transactional Machine Learning (MAADSTML)**\n\n*Revolutionizing Data Stream Science with Transactional Machine Learning*\n\n**Overview**\n\n*MAADSTML combines Artificial Intelligence, Auto Machine Learning with Data Streams Integrated with Apache Kafka to create frictionless and elastic machine learning solutions.*  \n\nThis library allows users to harness the power of agent-based computing using hundreds of advanced linear and non-linear algorithms. Users can easily integrate Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics and Optimization in any data stream solution by wrapping additional code around the functions below. It connects with **Apache KAFKA brokers** for cloud based computing using Kafka as the data backbone. \n\nIt uses VIPER as a **KAFKA connector and seamlessly combines Auto Machine Learning, with Real-Time Machine Learning, Real-Time Optimization and Real-Time Predictions** while publishing these insights in to a Kafka cluster in real-time at scale, while allowing users to consume these insights from anywhere, anytime and in any format.  We also provide management of algorithms and insights using our AiMS product integrated with VIPER and Kafka, to **help businesses reduce cloud compute and storage costs by tracking and controlling what algorithms are producing, and who is consuming these insights.**  If no one is consuming these insights, AiMS can **automatically deactivate** these algorithms thus STOPPING its use of storage and compute, saving organizations upto 20% in cloud costs. \n\nIt also HPDE as the AutoML technology for TML.  Linux/Windows/Mac versions can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/smaurice101/transactionalmachinelearning)\n\nIt uses VIPERviz to visualize streaming insights over HTTP(S). Linux/Windows/Mac versions can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/smaurice101/transactionalmachinelearning)\n\nMAADSTML details can be found in the forthcoming book: [Transactional Machine Learning with Data Streams and AutoML](https://github.com/smaurice101/transactionalmachinelearning_Book)\n\n\nTo install this library a request should be made to **support@otics.ca** for a username and a MAADSTOKEN.  Once you have these credentials then install this Python library.\n\n**Compatibility**\n    - Python 3.5 or greater\n    - Minimal Python skills needed\n\n**License**\n   - Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhD\n   - OTICS Advanced Analytics Inc.\n\n**Installation**\n   - At the command prompt write:\n     **pip install maadstml**\n     - This assumes you have [Downloaded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed it on your computer.  \n\n\n**MAADS-VIPER Connector to Manage Apache KAFKA:** \n  - MAADS-VIPER python library connects to VIPER instances on any servers; VIPER manages Apache Kafka.  VIPER is REST based and cross-platform that can run on windows, linux, MAC, etc.. It also fully supports SSL/TLS encryption in Kafka brokers for producing and consuming.\n\n- **viperlisttopics** \n  - List all topics in Kafka brokers\n\n- **viperdeactivatetopic**\n  - Deactivate topics in kafka brokers and prevent unused algorithms from consuming storage and computing resources that cost money \n\n- **viperactivatetopic**\n  - Activate topics in Kafka brokers \n\n- **vipercreatetopic**\n  - Create topics in Kafka brokers \n\n- **viperstats**\n  - List all stats from Kafka brokers allowing VIPER and KAFKA admins with a end-end view of who is producing data to algorithms, and who is consuming the insights from the algorithms including date/time stamp on the last reads/writes to topics, and how many bytes were read and written to topics and a lot more\n\n- **vipersubscribeconsumer**\n  - Admins can subscribe consumers to topics and consumers will immediately receive insights from topics.  This also gives admins more control of who is consuming the insights and allows them to ensures any issues are resolved quickly in case something happens to the algorithms.\n\n- **viperunsubscribeconsumer**\n  - Admins can unsubscribe consumers from receiving insights, this is important to ensure storage and compute resources are always used for active users.  For example, if a business user leaves your company or no longer needs the insights, by unsubscribing the consumer, the algorithm will STOP producing the insights.\n\n- **viperhpdetraining**\n  - Users can do real-time machine learning (RTML) on the data in Kafka topics. This is very powerful and useful for \"transactional learnings\" on the fly using our HPDE technology.  HPDE will find the optimal algorithm for the data in less than 60 seconds.  \n\n- **viperhpdepredict**\n  - Using the optimal algorithm - users can do real-time predictions from streaming data into Kafka Topics.\n\n- **viperhpdeoptimize**\n  -  Users can even do optimization to MINIMIZE or MAXIMIZE the optimal algorithm to find the BEST values for the independent variables that will minimize or maximize the dependent variable.\n\n- **viperproducetotopic**\n  - Users can produce to any topics by injesting from any data sources.\n\n- **viperconsumefromtopic**\n  - Users can consume from any topic and graph the data. \n\n- **viperconsumefromstreamtopic**\n  - Users can consume from a multiple stream of topics at once\n\n- **vipercreateconsumergroup**\n  - Admins can create a consumer group made up of any number of consumers.  You can add as many partitions for the group in the Kafka broker as well as specify the replication factor to ensure high availaibility and no disruption to users who consume insights from the topics.\n\n- **viperconsumergroupconsumefromtopic**\n  - Users who are part of the consumer group can consume from the group topic.\n\n- **viperproducetotopicstream**\n  - Users can join multiple topic streams and produce the combined results to another topic.\n\n- **vipercreatejointopicstreams**\n  - Users can join multiple topic streams\n\n- **vipercreatetrainingdata**\n  - Users can create a training data set from the topic streams for Real-Time Machine Learning (RTML) on the fly.\n\n- **vipermodifyconsumerdetails**\n  - Users can modify consumer details on the topic.  When topics are created an admin must indicate name, email, location and description of the topic.  This helps to better manage the topic and if there are issues, the admin can contact the individual consuming from the topic.\n\n- **vipermodifytopicdetails**\n  - Users can modify details on the topic.  When topics are created an admin must indicate name, email, location and description of the topic.  This helps to better manage the topic and if there are issues, the admin can contact the developer of the algorithm and resolve issue quickly to ensure disruption to consumers is minimal.\n\n- **vipergroupdeactivate**\n  - Admins can deactive a consumer group, which will stop all insights being delivered to consumers in the group.\n\n- **vipergroupactivate**\n  - Admins can activate a group to re-start the insights.\n\n- **viperdeletetopics**\n  - Admins can delete topics in VIPER database only.\n\n- **viperanomalytrain**\n  - Perform anomaly/peer group analysis on text or numeric data stream using advanced unsupervised learning. VIPER automatically joins \n    streams, and determines the peer group of \"usual\" behaviours using proprietary algorithms, which are then used to predict anomalies with \n\t*viperanomalypredict* in real-time.  Users can use several parameters to fine tune the peer groups.  \n\n\t*VIPER is one of the very few, if not only, technology to do anomaly/peer group analysis using unsupervised learning on data streams \n\twith Apache Kafka.*\n\n- **viperanomalypredict**\n  - Predicts anomalies for text or numeric data using the peer groups found with *viperanomalytrain*.  VIPER automatically joins streams\n  and compares each value with the peer groups and determines if a value is anomalous in real-time.  Users can use several parameters to fine tune\n  the analysis. \n\n  *VIPER is one of the very few, if not only, technology to do anomaly detection/predictions using unsupervised learning on data streams\n  with Apache Kafka.*\n\n\n**First import the Python library.**\n\n**import maadstml**\n\n\n**1. maadstml.viperstats(vipertoken,host,port=-999,brokerhost='',brokerport=-999,microserviceid='')**\n\n**Parameters:**\t\n\n*VIPERTOKEN* : string, required\n\n- A token given to you by VIPER administrator.\n\n*host* : string, required\n\n- Indicates the url where the VIPER instance is located and listening.\n\n*port* : int, required\n\n- Port on which VIPER is listenting.\n\n\n*brokerhost* : string, optional\n\n- Address where Kafka broker is running -
