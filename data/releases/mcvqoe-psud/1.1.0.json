    "description": "# PURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of this software is to measure the Probability of Successful Delivery\n(PSuD) of a push-to-talk network. PSuD generally describes the likelihood that\na message of a given length. \n\nCurrently there is no published paper on PSuD, check back with PSCR@PSCR.gov \nfor more information.\n\n## OBTAINING SOFTWARE\n\n- Probability of successful delivery measurement software available at:  https://github.com/usnistgov/psud\n- MCV QoE GUI software available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe\n- Core MCV QoE library available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base\n\n\n# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n- 1 computer able to run Python 3.9 or newer\n- 1 audio interface\n- 2 push-to-talk communications devices for testing\n- QoE hardware\n- cables to connect test devices to QoE hardware\n- Audio cables to connect QoE hardware to audio interface\n\n# RUNNING MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE\n\nThe easiest way to use the measurement system is to run the GUI (https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe).\n\n## Installation and Software\n\nTo install the `mcvqoe-psud` package, clone this repository and run the \nfollowing from the root of the git repository:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n# TECHNICAL SUPPORT\nFor more information or assistance on access delay measurements please contact:\n\nPublic Safety Communications Research Division\\\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\\\n325 Broadway\\\nBoulder, CO 80305\\\nPSCR@PSCR.gov\n\n# DISCLAIMER\n**Much of the included software was developed by NIST employees, for that software the following disclaimer applies:**\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
