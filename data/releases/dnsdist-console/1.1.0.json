You can use it to execute remote commands, \ndisplay a dashboard or easily extract statistics.\n\n\n## Table of contents\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Generate key](#generate-key)\n* [Handshake](#handshake)\n* [Run command](#run-command)\n* [Get statistics](#get-statistics)\n* [Display dashboard](#display-dashboard)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module can be installed from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dnsdist_console/) website\n\n```python\npip install dnsdist_console\n```\n\n## Generate key\n\nYou must configure your dnsdist load balancer to accept remote connection to the console.\nThis module can be used to generate the secret key as below.\n\nThe command in one line \n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"from dnsdist_console import Key;print(Key().generate())\"\nOTgmgAR6zbrfrYlKgsAAJn+by4faMqI1bVCvzacXMW0=\n```\n\nSave-it in your `/etc/dnsdist/dnsdist.conf` with the `setKey` directive.\n\n```\ncontrolSocket('0.0.0.0:5199')\nsetKey(\"GQpEpQoIuzA6kzgwDokX9JcXPXFvO1Emg1wAXToJ0ag=\")\n```\n\n## Handshake\n\nConfigure the client with the IP address and the TCP port of your dnsdist as well as the associated secret key.\nIf the provided key is incorrect, an exception will be raised.\n\n```python\nfrom dnsdist_console import Console\n\nconsole_ip = \"127.0.0.1\"\nconsole_port = 5199\nconsole_key = \"GQpEpQoIuzA6kzgwDokX9JcXPXFvO1Emg1wAXToJ0ag=\"\n\nconsole = Console(host=console_ip,\n                  port=console_port, \n                  key=console_key)\n```\n\n## Run command\n\nPlease refer to the [dnsdist documentation](https://dnsdist.org/reference/config.html) for all available commands.\n\n```python\no = console.send_command(cmd=\"showVersion()\")\nprint(o)\ndnsdist 1.4.0\n\n```\n\n## Get statistics\n\nUse this module to extract some statistics on your dnsdist load balancer.\nStatistics are stored in a python dictionary.\n\n```python\nfrom dnsdist_console import Statistics\n\ns = Statistics(console=console)\nprint(s[\"global\"][\"queries\"])\n3993\n```\n\nStatistics available:\n\n- globals (dict):\n    -
