If the provided key is incorrect, an exception will be raised.\n\n```python\nfrom dnsdist_console import Console\n\nconsole_ip = \"127.0.0.1\"\nconsole_port = 5199\nconsole_key = \"GQpEpQoIuzA6kzgwDokX9JcXPXFvO1Emg1wAXToJ0ag=\"\n\nconsole = Console(host=console_ip,\n                  port=console_port, \n                  key=console_key)\n```\n\nPlease refer to the [dnsdist documentation](https://dnsdist.org/reference/config.html) for all available commands.\n\n```python\no = console.send_command(cmd=\"showVersion()\")\nprint(o)\ndnsdist 1.4.0\n\n```\n\n## Get statistics\n\nUse this module to extract some statistics on your dnsdist load balancer.\nStatistics are stored in a python dictionary.\n\n```python\nfrom dnsdist_console import Statistics\n\ns = Statistics(console=console)\nprint(s[\"global\"][\"queries\"])\n3993\n\n# get top queries\nprint(s[\"top-queries\"])\n[\n    {'entry': 'www.apple.com.', 'hits': '9'},\n    {'entry': 'www.facebook.com.', 'hits': '3'},\n    {'entry': 'www.microsoft.com.', 'hits': '3'}\n]\n\n\n# get top nx domain\nprint(s[\"top-nxdomain\"])\n[\n    {'entry': 'www.nxdomain.com.', 'hits': '1'}\n    \n]\n\n# get top clients\nprint(s[\"top-clients\"])\n[\n    {'entry': '127.0.0.1', 'hits': '21'}\n]\n```\n\nStatistics available:\n\n- globals (dict):\n    -
