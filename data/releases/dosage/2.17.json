    "description": "# Dosage\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webcomics/dosage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webcomics/dosage)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/webcomics/dosage/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/webcomics/dosage)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/webcomics/dosage/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/webcomics/dosage)\n[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2020.svg)]()\n\nDosage is designed to keep a local copy of specific webcomics and other\npicture-based content such as Picture of the Day sites. With the dosage\ncommandline script you can get the latest strip of a webcomic, or catch-up to\nthe last strip downloaded, or download a strip for a particular date/index (if\nthe webcomic's site layout allows this).\n\nMultiple webcomics can be downloaded in parallel, making the update of comic\nstrips faster.\n\n## Notice\n\nThis software is in no way intended to publically \"broadcast\" comic strips, it\nis purely for personal use. Please be aware that by making downloaded strips\npublically available (without the explicit permission of the author) you may be\ninfringing upon various copyrights.\n\nAdditionally, Dosage respects the robots.txt exclusion protocol. This makes\nsure no content is accessed in an automatic way without consent by the\npublishers.\n\nIn any case, you should support the authors of the comics you are downloading,\neither by buying some of their products or even donating them some money since\nthey provide the comics you like and read.\n\nIf you are a publisher of comics and want Dosage to access your files,\nadd the following entry to your robots.txt file:\n\n    User-agent: Dosage\n    Allow: *\n\n## Usage\n\nList available comics (ca. 3000 at the moment):\n\n    $ dosage --list\n\nGet the latest comic of for example CalvinAndHobbes and save it in the \"Comics\"\ndirectory:\n\n    $ dosage CalvinAndHobbes\n\nIf you already have downloaded several comics and want to get the latest strip\nof all of them:\n\n    $ dosage @\n\n\nTo help others find good comics, you can vote for your favourite ones:\n\n    $ dosage --vote @\n\nFor advanced options and features execute `dosage --help`.\n\n### Adult content\n\nSome comics contain adult content and require age confirmation. These comics\ncan only be downloaded by using the `--adult` option, which confirms that you\nare old enough to view them.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies\n\nSince dosage is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), a Python\ninstallation is required: for Python 2.x at least 2.7.0, for Python 3.x at\nleast Python 3.5. Dosage requires some Python modules from PyPI, so\ninstallation with `pip` is recommended.\n\n### Using the Windows binary\n\nWindows users can download a complete binary (including Python) from the\n[release page].\n\n[release page]: https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/releases/latest\n\n### Install with pipx\n\nThe simplest way to install and upgrade dosage is with [pipx]. To install the\nnewest stable version with all optional features use:\n\n    pipx install --spec dosage[css,bash] dosage\n\nTo install the newest development version, use:\n\n    pipx install --spec \"dosage[css,bash] @ git+https://github.com/webcomics/dosage.git\" dosage\n\nTo upgrade such installations, just run:\n\n    pipx upgrade dosage\n\n### Installation for development\n\nIf you want to run dosage directly from the source code, you should install\nit in \"[editable]\" mode, preferable in a [virtual environment]:\n\n    pip install -e .[css,bash]\n\nYou can invoke Dosage directly from the source code as `./dosage`, but this\nmode of operation is discouraged, since dependencies might be missing.\n\n[pipx]: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx\n[editable]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs\n[virtual environment]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nYou can report bugs, patches or requests at the [GitHub issue\ntracker](https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/issues) - Dosage currently\nsupports a large number of comics and that number grows on a regular basis. If\nyou feel that there are comics that Dosage does not currently support, but\nshould support, please feel free to request them.\n\n## Extending Dosage\n\nIn order to add a new webcomic, a new module class has to be created in one of\nthe *.py files in the `dosagelib/plugins` subdirectory. Look at the\n[documentation for adding modules](doc/adding_new_comics.md) and at\nexisting module classes for examples.\n\n### Test suite status\n\nDosage has extensive unit tests to ensure the code quality.\n[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is used for continuous build and test\nintegration. See the badges at the top of this page for the current status.\n\n\n",
