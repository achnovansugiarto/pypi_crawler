    "description": "# MirahezeBots\n\nMirahezeBots is an IRC bot mainly used by [Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org)\n([#miraheze on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=miraheze)).\n\nIt is simple and easy to customize.\nMirahezeBot uses [Sopel](https://sopel.chat).\n\nTo use this bot, simply type install 'MirahezeBot-Plugins' from PyPi and then run 'sopel configure --plugins'\n\nTo make use of the beta branch, clone the repo and check the 'dev' branch out and use pip's \"install .\" function to install it. You can then use 'sopel configure --plugins' as normal.\n\nPlease note that in line with our security policy, we can only support Sopel 7.0.5 - 8.0 installations running Python 3.6+.\n\n[Source Github](http://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel)\n\n[More info](https://bots.miraheze.wiki)\n\n[Documentation](https://bots.miraheze.wiki/documentation.html)\n\n\n\n**Changelog**\n\nPlease see below for changes to MirahezeBot-Plugins\n# Version 9.1.1\n- Fixed developer requirements blocking newer versions of channelmgnt.\n# Version 9.1.0\n- CI: Migrate to GitHub-Actions\n- CI: Support Python 3.9, Windows and MacOS\n- dbclean: style changes\n- example-db: rename\n- adminlist: split to own package\n- joinall: split to own package\n- phab: use new jsonparser\n- pingpong: split to own package\n- responses: style changes and switch to VERSION keyword\n- rss: style changes\n- status: style changes & new jsonparser\n- welcome: style changes and remove get_filename, replace with bot.known_users_filename\n- jsonparser: split to own package\n- version: introduce VERSION, VERSIONARRAY and SHORTVERSION keywords\n- Security: Drop support for Sopel 7.0.5 & 7.0.6\n- requirements: update some and slacken others\n- build: style changes\n# Version 9.0.3\n- Fixed an issue affecting new installs due to a transient dependancy\n# Version 9.0.2\n## Security fixes\n# Version 9.0.0\n## Miscellaneous\n- travis: changed test configuration\n- responses: corrections and style changes\n- rss: style improvements\n- test models: style tweaks\n- test general: up'd max line length\n- test rss: style changes & replaced http:// with https://\n## Requirements\n- mwclient no longer required\n- Setuptools bumped from 49.5.0 to 49.6.0\n- flake8 is now required for developers\n- SQLAchemy is now at 1.3.19\n## Plugins\n- all: removed future imports\n- channelmgnt: switched to caching the json config\n- channelmgnt: introduced a makemodechange system\n- channelmgnt: added support_channel config\n- status: replaced mwclient with a new util script, introduced cached json config, renamed other config\n- phab: Introduced channel specific configuration\n\n\n# Version 8.0.3\n## Miscellaneous\n- Changes to the gitignore file & manifest to ensure proper handling of downloads & uploads\n- Changes to build configuration to prevent wasted checks\n- Cleaner Changelog\n## requirements\n- Setuptools was bumped from 49.2.0 to 49.2.1 for developers\n## phab\n- A bug was fixed with the task regex (T57)\n\n# Version 8.0.1 & 8.0.2\n- Changes to the build configuartion to prevent PyPi errors\n\n# Version 8.0.0\nIn this update, we switch to using PyPi to install rather than copying to the plugins/modules folder.
