    "description": "# MirahezeBots\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MirahezeBots/MirahezeBots.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/MirahezeBots/MirahezeBots)\n\nMirahezeBots is an IRC bot mainly used by [Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org)\n([#miraheze on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=miraheze)).\n\nIt is simple and easy to customize.\nMirahezeBot uses [Sopel](https://sopel.chat).\n\nTo use this bot, simply type install 'MirahezeBot-Plugins' from PyPi and then run 'sopel configure --plugins'\n\nTo make use of the beta branch, clone the repo and check the 'dev' branch out and use pip's \"install .\" function to install it. You can then use 'sopel configure --plugins' as normal.\n\nPlease note that in line with our security policy, we can only support Sopel 7.0.5 - 8.0 installations running Python 3.6+.\n\n[Source Github](http://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel)\n\n[More info](https://bots.miraheze.wiki)\n\n[Documentation](https://bots.miraheze.wiki/documentation.html)\n\n\n\n**Changelog**\n\nPlease see below for changes to MirahezeBot-Plugins\n\n# Version 8.0.3\n## Miscellaneous\n- Changes to the gitignore file & manifest to ensure proper handling of downloads & uploads\n- Changes to build configuration to prevent wasted checks\n- Cleaner Changelog\n## requirements\n- Setuptools was bumped from 49.2.0 to 49.2.1 for developers\n## phab\n- A bug was fixed with the task regex (T57)\n\n# Version 8.0.1 & 8.0.2\n- Changes to the build configuartion to prevent PyPi errors\n\n# Version 8.0.0\nIn this update, we switch to using PyPi to install rather than copying to the plugins/modules folder.
