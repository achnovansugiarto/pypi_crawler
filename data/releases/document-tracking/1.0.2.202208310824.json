    "description": "# `document_tracking`\n\nThis project is originaly based on the Miranda et al.’s implementation of a news tracking algorithm published in the following paper (original code: [![](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/badge/directory/2b5a159195789c76ecb01692b70bdd3a9e63dbf2/)](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/directory/2b5a159195789c76ecb01692b70bdd3a9e63dbf2/\n))\n\n    Miranda, Sebastião, Artūrs Znotiņš, Shay B. Cohen, et Guntis Barzdins. \n    2018. “Multilingual Clustering of Streaming News”. In 2018 \n    Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 4535‑44.\n    Brussels, Belgium: Association for Computational Linguistics. \n    https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1483/.\n\nThis work is a reimplementation of the original work from these authors where the entire API was rewritten to be used by external projects. The idea of this reimplementation is to propose the news tracking algorithms with industrial standards, such as allowing automation and quality.\n\nThe package also includes alternative algorithms and baselines, currently only K-Means is provided.\n\n|     **Algorithm**     | **Supervised** |                  **Main Class**                 |\n|:---------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|\n| Miranda et al. (2018) | Yes            | `document_tracking.miranda.StreamingAggregator` |\n| K-Means               | No             | `document_tracking.kmeans.KMeansAggregator`     |\n\nUse the [`news_tracking`](https://gitlab.univ-lr.fr/cross-lingual-event-tracking/developpement/from-documents-to-events/news_tracking) package in order to use this library if you’re not a developer.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install document_tracking\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nSome parts, provided by Miranda et al. in their original paper remain under the BSD-3 clause. The code that is reused from the original code is provided under a `third_party` package and remains under its own license. Other part are released under the GPLv3 licence. To make it easier distinguish both licenses, headers were added on top of files. Both licenses are included in this repository.\n\n\n",
