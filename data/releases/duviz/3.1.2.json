Use it how you want it.\n- Only uses standard library and just depends on ``du`` and ``ls`` utilities,\n  which are available out of the box on a typical Unix platform (Linux, macOS)\n- Speed. No need to wait for a GUI tool to get up and running, let alone scanning your disk.\n  The hard work is done by ``du`` (or ``ls``), which run an C-speed.\n- Progress reporting while you wait. Be hypnotized!\n- Detects your terminal width for maximum visualization pleasure.\n- Apart from file size (the default), you can also just count files (inodes)\n- Option to use terminal colors for the boxes instead of ASCII art\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPip based\n    duviz can be installed with pip in a desired virtual environment::\n\n        pip install duviz\n\n    which will install a ``duviz`` command line utility in your environment.\n\n    If you already have `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_ on your toolbelt,\n    you might prefer to install duviz in an automatically managed,\n    isolated environment with ``pipx install duviz``.\n\nWith Homebrew\n    duviz can also be installed with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_::\n\n        brew install https://raw.github.com/soxofaan/duviz/master/extra/homebrew/duviz.rb\n\nNo installation\n    The file ``duviz.py`` is also designed to be usable as a standalone Python script,\n    without having to install it.\n    Download ``duviz.py`` and just run it::\n\n        python path/to/duviz.py\n\n\nPython 2 Support\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``duviz`` was originally (2009) a Python 2 script, and started supporting Python 3 around 2016.\nWith the end of life of Python 2 nearing in 2019, support for Python 2 was dropped.\nThe Python 2 compatible version can be found in the ``py2-compatible`` branch (last release: 1.1.1).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIf you run ``duviz`` without arguments, it will render the disk usage of the current working folder.\nIf you specify one or more directories, it will render the usage of those directories, how intuitive is that!\n\nInstead of size in bytes, you can also get inode usage: just use the option ``--inodes`` (or ``-i`` in short).\n\nRun it with option ``--help`` for more options.\n",
