Django uses some Python \"magic\" that makes having precise types for some code patterns problematic. This is why we need this project. The final goal is to be able to get precise types for most common patterns.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install django-stubs\n```\n\nTo make mypy aware of the plugin, you need to add\n\n```ini\n[mypy]\nplugins =\n    mypy_django_plugin.main\n\n[mypy.plugins.django-stubs]\ndjango_settings_module = \"myproject.settings\"\n```\n\nin your `mypy.ini` or `setup.cfg` [file](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html).\n\n[pyproject.toml](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#using-a-pyproject-toml-file) configurations are also supported:\n\n```toml\n[tool.mypy]\nplugins = [\"mypy_django_plugin.main\"]\n\n[tool.django-stubs]\ndjango_settings_module = \"myproject.settings\"\n```\n\nTwo things happening here:\n\n1. We need to explicitly list our plugin to be loaded by `mypy`\n2. Our plugin also requires `django` settings module (what you put into `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable) to be specified\n\nThis fully working [typed boilerplate](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template) can serve you as an example.\n\n## Version compatibility\n\nWe rely on different `django` and `mypy` versions:\n\n| django-stubs | mypy version | django version | python version\n| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 1.9.0 | 0.910 | 3.2.x | ^3.6\n| 1.8.0 | 0.812 | 3.1.x | ^3.6\n| 1.7.0 | 0.790 | 2.2.x \\|\\| 3.x | ^3.6\n| 1.6.0 | 0.780 | 2.2.x \\|\\| 3.x | ^3.6\n| 1.5.0 | 0.770 | 2.2.x \\|\\| 3.x | ^3.6\n| 1.4.0 | 0.760 | 2.2.x \\|\\| 3.x | ^3.6\n| 1.3.0 | 0.750 | 2.2.x \\|\\| 3.x | ^3.6\n| 1.2.0 | 0.730 | 2.2.x | ^3.6\n| 1.1.0 | 0.720 | 2.2.x | ^3.6\n| 0.12.x | old semantic analyzer (<0.711), dmypy support | 2.1.x | ^3.6\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is this an official Django project?\n\nNo, it is not. We are independent from Django at the moment.\nThere's a [proposal](https://github.com/django/deps/pull/65) to merge our project into the Django itself.\nYou can show your support by liking the PR.\n\n### Is it safe to use this in production?\n\nYes, it is! This project does not affect your runtime at all.\nIt only affects `mypy` type checking process.\n\nBut, it does not make any sense to use this project without `mypy`.\n\n### mypy crashes when I run it with this plugin installed\n\nThe current implementation uses Django's runtime to extract information about models, so it might crash if your installed apps or `models.py` are broken.\n\nIn other words, if your `manage.py runserver` crashes, mypy will crash too.\nYou can also run `mypy` with [`--tb`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-show-traceback)\noption to get extra information about the error.\n\n### I cannot use QuerySet or Manager with type annotations\n\nYou can get a `TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable`\nwhen you will try to use `QuerySet[MyModel]`, `Manager[MyModel]` or some other Django-based Generic types.\n\nThis happens because these Django classes do not support [`__class_getitem__`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0560/#class-getitem) magic method in runtime.\n\n1. You can go with our [`django_stubs_ext`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/tree/master/django_stubs_ext) helper, that patches all the types we use as Generic in django.\n\nInstall it:\n\n```bash\npip install django-stubs-ext  # as a production dependency\n```\n\nAnd then place in your top-level settings:\n\n```python\nimport django_stubs_ext\n\ndjango_stubs_ext.monkeypatch()\n```\n\nNote: This monkey patching approach will only work when using Python 3.7 and higher, when the `__class_getitem__` magic method was introduced.\n\n2. You can use strings instead: `'QuerySet[MyModel]'` and `'Manager[MyModel]'`, this way it will work as a type for `mypy` and as a regular `str` in runtime.\n\n### How can I create a HttpRequest that's guaranteed to have an authenticated user?\n\nDjango's built in `HttpRequest` has the attribute `user` that resolves to the type\n```python\nUnion[User, AnonymousUser]\n```\nwhere `User` is the user model specified by the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting.\n\nIf you want a `HttpRequest` that you can type-annotate with where you know that the user is authenticated you can subclass the normal `HttpRequest` class like so:\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpRequest\nfrom my_user_app.models import MyUser\n\nclass AuthenticatedHttpRequest(HttpRequest):\n    user: MyUser\n```\n\nAnd then use `AuthenticatedHttpRequest` instead of the standard `HttpRequest` for when you know that the user is authenticated. For example in views using the `@login_required` decorator.\n\n\n### My QuerySet methods are returning Any rather than my Model\n\n`QuerySet.as_manager()` is not currently supported.\n\nIf you are using `MyQuerySet.as_manager()`, then your `Manager`/`QuerySet` methods will all not be linked to your model.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModelQuerySet(models.QuerySet):\n  pass\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n  bar = models.IntegerField()\n  objects = MyModelQuerySet.as_manager()\n\ndef use_my_model():\n  foo = MyModel.objects.get(id=1) # This is `Any` but it should be `MyModel`\n  return foo.xyz # No error, but there should be\n```\n\nThere is a workaround: use `Manager.from_queryset` instead.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModelQuerySet(models.QuerySet):\n  pass\n\nMyModelManager = models.Manager.from_queryset(MyModelQuerySet)\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n  bar = models.IntegerField()\n  objects = MyModelManager()\n\ndef use_my_model():\n  foo = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)\n  return foo.xyz # Gives an error\n```\n\n### How do I annotate cases where I called QuerySet.annotate?\n\nDjango-stubs provides a special type, `django_stubs_ext.WithAnnotations[Model]`, which indicates that the `Model` has\nbeen annotated, meaning it allows getting/setting extra attributes on the model instance.\n\nOptionally, you can provide a `TypedDict` of these attributes,\ne.g. `WithAnnotations[MyModel, MyTypedDict]`, to specify which annotated attributes are present.\n\nCurrently, the mypy plugin can recognize that specific names were passed to `QuerySet.annotate` and\ninclude them in the type, but does not record the types of these attributes.\n\nThe knowledge of the specific annotated fields is not yet used in creating more specific types for `QuerySet`'s\n`values`, `values_list`, or `filter` methods, however knowledge that the model was annotated _is_ used to create a\nbroader type result type for `values`/`values_list`, and to allow `filter`ing on any field.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict\nfrom django_stubs_ext import WithAnnotations\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.expressions import Value\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n\ndef func(m: WithAnnotations[MyModel]) -> str:\n    return m.asdf # OK, since the model is annotated as allowing any attribute\n\nfunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(foo=Value(\"\")).get(id=1))  # OK\nfunc(MyModel.objects.get(id=1))  # Error, since this model will not allow access to any attribute\n\n\nclass MyTypedDict(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\ndef func2(m: WithAnnotations[MyModel, MyTypedDict]) -> str:\n    print(m.bar) # Error, since field \"bar\" is not in MyModel or MyTypedDict.\n    return m.foo # OK, since we said field \"foo\" was allowed\n\nfunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(foo=Value(\"\")).get(id=1))  # OK\nfunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(bar=Value(\"\")).get(id=1))  # Error\n```\n\n## Related projects\n\n- [`awesome-python-typing`](https://github.com/typeddjango/awesome-python-typing) - Awesome list of all typing-related things in Python.\n- [`djangorestframework-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/djangorestframework-stubs) - Stubs for Django REST Framework.\n- [`pytest-mypy-plugins`](https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins) - `pytest` plugin that we use for testing `mypy` stubs and plugins.\n- [`wemake-django-template`](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template) - Create new typed Django projects in seconds.\n\n\n\n## To get help\n\nWe have Gitter here: <https://gitter.im/mypy-django/Lobby>\nIf you think you have more generic typing issue, please refer to <https://github.com/python/mypy> and their Gitter.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is open source and community driven.
