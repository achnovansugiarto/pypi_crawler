    "description": "About the Neural Network MLPClassifier\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe *Neural Network MLPClassifier* software package is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package\nthat provides a supervised classification method for multi-band passive optical remote sensing data.\nIt uses an MLP (Multi-Layer Perception) Neural Network Classifier and is based on the Neural Network MLPClassifier\nby scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html.\n\nThe program was originally developed by Lieven P.C. Verbeke (Ghent University, Laboratory of Forest Management and\nSpatial Information Techniques). It was written in C++ and ported to PyQGIS in 2019 - 2020. It has been developed in an\nopen source environment to encourage further development of the tool.\n\nThe **instruction pages** can be found at https://mlp-image-classifier.readthedocs.io and include guidance for\ninstallation, a user manual, exercises and an API.\n\nThe **repository** and **testdata** can be found at https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/lnns.\n\nReferencing the Neural Network MLPClassifier\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWhen using the Neural Network MLPClassifier, please use the following citation:\n\nCrabbé, A.
