    "description": "[![PyPi Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/maestral.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/maestral/)\n[![Pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/maestral.svg)](https://pypi.org/pypi/maestral/)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/maestral/badge/?version=latest)](https://maestral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n# Maestral <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/maestral/resources/maestral.png\" align=\"right\" title=\"Maestral\" width=\"110\" height=\"110\">\n\nA light-weight and open-source Dropbox client for macOS and Linux.\n\n## About\n\nMaestral is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. The project's main goal is to\nprovide a client for platforms and file systems that are no longer directly supported by\nDropbox.\n\nMaestral currently does not support Dropbox Paper, the management of Dropbox teams and\nthe management of shared folder settings. If you need any of this functionality, please\nuse the Dropbox website or the official client. Maestral does support syncing\nmultiple Dropbox accounts and excluding local files from sync with a \".mignore\" file.\n\nThe focus on \"simple\" file syncing does come with advantages: on macOS, the Maestral App\nbundle is significantly smaller than the official Dropbox app (20 MB vs 290 MB) and uses\nmuch less memory (100 MB vs 800 MB for a medium sized Dropbox on macOS). The memory usage\nwill depend on the size of your synced Dropbox folder and can be further reduced when\nrunning Maestral without a GUI.\n\nMaestral uses the public Dropbox API which, unlike the official client, does not support\ntransferring only those parts of a file which changed (\"binary diff\"). Maestral may\ntherefore use more bandwidth that the official client. However, it will avoid uploading\nor downloading a file if it already exists with the same content locally or in the cloud.\n\n## Warning\n\n- Never sync a folder with both the offical Dropbox client and Maestral at the same time.\n- Network drives and some external hard drives are not supported as locations for the\n  Dropbox folder.\n\n## Installation\n\nAn app bundle is provided for macOS High Sierra and higher and can be downloaded from the\nReleases tab. On other platforms, please download and install the Python package from PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade maestral\n```\n\nIf you intend to use the graphical user interface, you also need to specify the GUI option\nduring installation or upgrade. This will install the `maestral-qt` frontend and `PyQt5`\non Linux and `maestral-cocoa` on macOS:\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade maestral[gui]\n```\n\nMore detailed installation instructions are given in the\n[Wiki](https://github.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/wiki/Installation-Requirements).\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `maestral gui` in the command line (or open the Maestral app on macOS) to start\nMaestral with a graphical user interface. On its first run, Maestral will guide you\nthrough linking and configuring your Dropbox and will then start syncing.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/macOS_light.png\" alt=\"screenshot macOS\" width=\"840\"/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/Ubuntu.png\" alt=\"screenshot Fedora\" width=\"840\"/>\n\n### Command line usage\n\nAfter installation, Maestral will be available as a command line script by typing\n`maestral` in the command prompt. Type `maestral --help` to get a full list of available\ncommands. The most important are:\n\n- `maestral gui`: Starts the Maestral GUI. Creates a sync daemon if not already running.\n- `maestral start|stop`: Starts or stops the Maestral sync daemon.\n- `maestral pause|resume`: Pauses or resumes syncing.\n- `maestral autostart -Y|-N`: Sets the daemon to start on log in.\n- `maestral status`: Gets the current status of Maestral.\n- `maestral file-status LOCAL_PATH`: Gets the sync status of an individual file or folder.\n- `maestral excluded add|remove|list`: Command group to manage excluded folders.\n- `maestral ls DROPBOX_PATH`: Lists the contents of a directory on Dropbox.\n- `maestral notify snooze N`: Snoozes desktop notifications for N minutes.\n\nMaestral supports syncing multiple Dropbox accounts by running multiple instances\nwith different configuration files. This needs to be configured from the command\nline by passing the option `--config-name` to `maestral start` or `maestral gui`.\nMaestral will then select an existing config with the given name or create a new one.\nFor example:\n\n```console\n$ maestral start --config-name=\"personal\"\n$ maestral start --config-name=\"work\"\n```\n\nThis will start two instances of Maestral, syncing a private and a work account,\nrespectively. Configs will be automatically cleared when unlinking an account and you can\nlist all currently linked accounts with `maestral configs`:\n\n```console\n$ maestral configs\n\nConfig name  Account\npersonal     user@gmail.com\nwork         user@mycorp.org\n\n```\n\nBy default, the Dropbox folder names will contain the capitalised config-name in braces.\nIn the above case, this will be \"Dropbox (Personal)\" and \"Dropbox (Work)\".\n\n### Docker usage\n\nThe Docker image is available for x86, arm/v7 (32bit) and arm64 platforms. You can do\neverything that you supposed to do in the command line, except running the GUI.\n\nFor the first run, get access to the shell within the Docker container \n\n```console\n$ docker run -it -v /mnt/dropbox:/dropbox maestraldbx/maestral:latest ash\n```\n\nwhere `/mnt/dropbox` is the directory that which contains the `Dropbox` directory.\nMaestral runs with `UID` 1000, make sure that the user owns `/mnt/dropbox` and the\ncontents within (`chown -R 1000 /mnt/dropbox`).\n\nLater, if you want just a `maestral start`, just execute\n\n```console\n$ docker run \\\n  -d \\\n  --name maestral \\\n  --rm \\\n  -v /mnt/dropbox:/dropbox \\\n  maestraldbx/maestral:latest\n```\n\n- To step into the Maestral container: `docker exec -it maestral ash`\n- List the logs of the container: `docker logs maestral`\n- Get the build info of a running container: `docker inspect maestral | jq \".[].Config.Labels\"`\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are multiple topics that could use your help. Some of them are easy, such as adding\nnew CLI commands, others require more experience, such as packaging for non-macOS platforms.\nLook out for issues marked with \"good first issue\" or \"help wanted\". Pull requests should be\nmade against the develop branch.\n\nRelevant resources are:\n\n- [Maestral API docs](https://maestral.readthedocs.io)\n- [Dropbox API docs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation)\n- [Dropbox Python SDK docs](https://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\nIf you are using the macOS app bundle, please consider sponsoring the project with Â£1 per \nmonth to offset the cost of an Apple Developer account to sign and notiarize the bundle.\n\n## System requirements\n\n- macOS (10.13 or higher for binary) or Linux\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n- For the system tray icon on Linux:\n  - [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator)\n    on Gnome 3.26 and higher\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n- The config module uses code from the [Spyder IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide)\n- The DropboxClient is inspired by work from [Orphilia](https://github.com/ksiazkowicz/orphilia-dropbox)\n- Error reporting is powered by bugsnag:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://bugsnag.com\"> <img src=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c741219fd0819540590e785/5c741219fd0819856890e790_asset%2039.svg\" title=\"Bugsnag text\" height=\"20\"></a>",
