    "description": "[![PyPi Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/maestral.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/maestral/)\n[![Pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/maestral.svg)](https://pypi.org/pypi/maestral/)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/maestral/badge/?version=latest)](https://maestral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n# Maestral <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/maestral/resources/maestral.png\" align=\"right\" title=\"Maestral\" width=\"110\" height=\"110\">\n\nA light-weight and open-source Dropbox client for macOS and Linux.\n\n## About\n\nMaestral is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. The project's main goal is to\nprovide a client for platforms and file systems that are no longer directly supported by\nDropbox.\n\nMaestral currently does not support Dropbox Paper, the management of Dropbox teams and\nthe management of shared folder settings. If you need any of this functionality, please\nuse the Dropbox website or the official client. Maestral does support syncing\nmultiple Dropbox accounts and excluding local files from sync with a \".mignore\" file.\n\nThe focus on \"simple\" file syncing does come with advantages: on macOS, the Maestral App\nbundle is significantly smaller than the official Dropbox app (20 MB vs 290 MB) and uses\nmuch less memory (100 MB vs 800 MB for a medium sized Dropbox on macOS). The memory usage\nwill depend on the size of your synced Dropbox folder and can be further reduced when\nrunning Maestral without a GUI.\n\nMaestral uses the public Dropbox API which, unlike the official client, does not support\ntransferring only those parts of a file which changed (\"binary diff\"). Maestral may\ntherefore use more bandwidth that the official client. However, it will avoid uploading\nor downloading a file if it already exists with the same content locally or in the cloud.\n\n## Installation\n\nAn app bundle is provided for macOS High Sierra and higher and can be downloaded from the\nReleases tab. On other platforms, please download and install the Python package from PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade maestral\n```\n\nIf you intend to use the graphical user interface, you also need to specify the GUI option\nduring installation. This will install the `maestral-qt` frontend and `PyQt5`:\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade maestral[gui]\n```\n\nMore detailed installation instructions are given in the\n[Wiki](https://github.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/wiki/Installation-Requirements).\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `maestral gui` in the command line (or open the Maestral app on macOS) to start\nMaestral with a graphical user interface. On its first run, Maestral will guide you\nthrough linking and configuring your Dropbox and will then start syncing.\n\n![screenshot macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/macOS_light.png)\n![screenshot Fedora](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/Ubuntu.png)\n\n## Command line usage\n\nAfter installation, Maestral will be available as a command line script by typing\n`maestral` in the command prompt. Type `maestral --help` to get a full list of available\ncommands. The most important are:\n\n- `maestral gui`: Starts the Maestral GUI. Creates a sync daemon if not already running.\n- `maestral start|stop`: Starts or stops the Maestral sync daemon.\n- `maestral pause|resume`: Pauses or resumes syncing.\n- `maestral autostart`: Sets the daemon to start on log in.\n- `maestral status`: Gets the current status of Maestral.\n- `maestral file-status LOCAL_PATH`: Gets the sync status of an individual file or folder.\n- `maestral excluded add|remove|list`: Command group to manage excluded folders.\n- `maestral ls DROPBOX_PATH`: Lists the contents of a directory on Dropbox.\n- `maestral notify snooze N`: Snoozes desktop notifications for N minutes.\n\nMaestral supports syncing multiple Dropbox accounts by running multiple instances\nwith different configuration files. This needs to be configured from the command\nline by passing the option `--config-name` to `maestral start` or `maestral gui`.\nMaestral will then select an existing config with the given name or create a new one.\nFor example:\n\n```console\n$ maestral start --config-name=\"personal\"\n$ maestral start --config-name=\"work\"\n```\n\nThis will start two instances of Maestral, syncing a private and a work account,\nrespectively. Configs will be automatically cleared when unlinking an account and you can\nlist all currently linked accounts with `maestral configs`:\n\n```console\n$ maestral configs\n\nConfig name  Account\npersonal     user@gmail.com\nwork         user@mycorp.org\n\n```\n\nBy default, the Dropbox folder names will contain the capitalised config-name in braces.\nIn the above case, this will be \"Dropbox (Personal)\" and \"Dropbox (Work)\".\n\n## Contribute\n\nA documentation for developers is available at\n[https://maestral.readthedocs.io](https://maestral.readthedocs.io).\nThe following tasks could need your help:\n\n- [ ] Packaging for non-macOS platforms.\n- [ ] Write tests for Maestral.\n- [ ] A native GTK frontend. Maestral currently uses PyQt5.\n\n## Warning\n\n- Maestral is still in beta status. Even though unlikely, using it may potentially\n  result in loss of data.\n- Network drives and some external hard drives are not supported as locations for the\n  Dropbox folder.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- macOS (10.13 or higher for binary) or Linux\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n- For the GUI only:\n  - PyQt 5.9 or higher\n  - [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator)\n    on Gnome 3.26 and higher\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n- The config module uses code from the [Spyder IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide)\n- The MaestralApiClient is based on work from [Orphilia](https://github.com/ksiazkowicz/orphilia-dropbox)\n- Error reporting is powered by bugsnag:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://bugsnag.com\"> <img src=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c741219fd0819540590e785/5c741219fd0819856890e790_asset%2039.svg\" title=\"Bugsnag text\" height=\"20\"></a>",
