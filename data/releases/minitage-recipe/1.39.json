    "description": "******************************************************************************\nRecipe for compiling and installing software with or without minitage\n******************************************************************************\n\n.. contents::\n\n=======================\nIntroduction\n=======================\n\nThis was a collection of recipes which can be use inside or outside a minitage environment.\n\nAs they are now all splitted out from this package, we keep only left the\nentry points for asccendant compatibility purpose.\nthe build environment automaticly.\n\nThe egg has those entry point:\n    - *cmmi*: install configure/make/make install softwares\n    - *fetch*: fetch something, somewhere, with git, http, frp, static, hg, svn or bzr.\n    - *egg*: install python eggs / packages 'setuptoolisables'\n    - *printer*: print or dump to a file all versions needed to achieve eggs\n      requirements (versions.cfg made easy)\n    - *scripts*: install scripts from an egg and install egg dependencies if they\n      are not already in the cache\n    - *wsgi*: Make a Python paste configuration file eatable by mod_wsgi with\n      all the eggs dependencies you need.\n\nYou can browse the code on minitage's following resources:\n\n    - http://git.minitage.org/git/minitage/eggs/minitage.recipe/\n    - http://www.minitage.org/trac/browser/minitage/eggs/minitage.recipe\n\nYou can migrate your buldouts without any effort with buildout.minitagificator:\n\n    * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.minitagificator\n\n\n\n=======================\nCHANGELOG\n=======================\n\nUP\n----------\n    - integrate other recipes\n\n1.35\n--------\n\n    - split recipes into separate packages\n\n\n1.34\n-------\n\nall:\n\n    - fix rst doc\n\n    - add ``ldflags`` and ``ldflags`` options\n\nminitage.recipe.cmmi:\n\n    - ``install-in-place`` option added and pivot on make install slightly\n      modified\n    - ``skip-flags`` option added\n    - ``prefix`` option added\n\nminitage.recipe.fetch:\n\n    - ``unpack`` option added\n    - md5sum un revision for static fetcher check added\n\nminitage.recipe.printer:\n\n    - remove fake eggs and develop eggs from fixed versions.\n\n-> 1.20\n---------\n\nMinitage.recipe.egg:\n\n    - better errors handling\n    - In particular for eggs and url, now md5 urls are preferred.\n    - Also when we can't download a distribution from somewhere, we try to\n      fallback to other distributions which achieve the desired requirement\n    - In the same way, try to compile eggs from any other sdist fullfilling the\n      requirement if an error occurs on the first found.\n\nMinitage.recipe.cmmi:\n\n    - new patch selection for freebsd:\n        freebsd-patches\n\n    - Fix some double spaces left in compilation flags which broke some exotic\n      system builders.\n\n1.14\n-----\n\n    - add enrionment file generation to the scripts recipe\n\n1.13\n---------\n\n    - cmmi buggy update methods\n\n1.11 - 1.12\n----------------\n\n    - rescan egg direcrectories at install time because there may be new\n      develop eggs or eggs installed by buildout extensions (mr.developer)\n    - fix for interaction with buildout.minitagificator and\n      zc.buildout.easy_install..*script\n\n\n1.-1.10\n---------\n\n    - bugfix with cache and static distributions.\n\n1.8\n-------\n\n    - make patches go in a personnal directory with some md5 mecanism to redownload them.\n\n1.4->1.7\n----------\n\n    - x64 fixes\n    - bugfix in static distribution install when you have patches to apply.\n\n1.3\n----\n\n    - release uncomitted unittests updates\n\n1.2\n-------\n\n    - make it compatible with zc.buildout 1.0\n\n1.1\n-----\n\n    - md5 bug\n\n1.0\n------\n\n    * first stable release.\n    * All recipe are documented and well tested.\n    * buildout.minitagificator is completed.\n    * stabilized and synced with other minitage components\n    * minitage.recipe:eggs has been drasticly improved in term of algorythms and speed.\n\n0.33->0.34\n-----------\n\n    - Fix python executable computation\n\n0.32\n-----\n\n    - Documentation and tests release\n\n0.29\n----\n\n    - Fix bug in recipes initialization because of buildout auto-ordering\n\n\n0.28\n----\n\n    - Add another hook to the cmmi recipe: post-download\n\n0.27\n-----\n\n    - Fix an annoying bug when you are using virtualenv and a classical\n      python as executable in your recipe, it may occur that sometimes, the\n      virtualenv site-packages is appended to PYTHONPATH. As a fix, we now\n      filter all python core lib directories and site packages that are not\n      relevant to the python used by the recipe.\n\n0.26\n-----\n\n    - Introduce the minitage.recipe:wsgi recipe wich wraps a paste wsgi application\n      in a script eatable by mod_wsgi\n\n0.25\n------\n\n    - stop lowering project_name\n\n\n0.23->0.24\n-----------\n\n    - Fix small bugs in printer\n\n0.22\n-----\n\n    - Introduce a new recipe : minitage.recipe:printer which prints/dumps to a\n      file all versions eggs needed to achieve requirements.\n\n0.21\n-----\n\n    - Fix bug in compilation  directory guessing\n\n0.20\n------\n\n    - Fix bug in distribution reloading\n    - Better handling of pkg_resources's working set\n\n0.19\n--------\n\n    - add a post build hook\n\n0.18\n-------\n\n    - Change installation order\n\n0.16\n-------\n\n    - Fix index and find links options\n\n0.14 -> 0.15\n-------------\n    - logging output improved\n    - newest mode handling\n\n0.13\n-----\n- fix static dist install\n\n\n\n0.12\n------\n\n    - bugfix for zipped eggs\n\n0.11\n-----\n\n    - import bugfix for minitagificator\n\n0.10\n-----------\n\n    - Change some logging options\n    - follow allow host option from buildout for eggs installation\n\n0.9\n-----------\n\n    - Do not rely anymore on zc.buildout ez for script generation\n\n0.7 -> 0.8\n-----------\n\n    - egg and scripts recipes were rewritten a lot to adapt their api to\n      zc.recipe.egg\n    - Common to all recipes: all arguements are now identicak to zc.recipe.cmmi\n      or zc.recipe.egg\n    - Dependencies resolver has been improved a lot\n    - For static distribution, you can know speicify multiple urls with 'urls'\n\n\n0.6\n------\n\n    - fix bug in path generation in minitage.recipe:scripts\n\n0.2 -> 0.5\n-------------\n\n    - add make-options for make option in minitage.recipe.cmmi\n    - multiple bugfixes\n    - make things append in subprocess for environment conversation\n    - add initiaiization code for generated python interpreter in\n      minitage.recipe:scripts\n\n0.1\n------\n    - add fetch recipe\n\n0.0.13\n-------\n - fix zip safe flag\n\n0.0.11\n-------\n - Include eggs dependencies by default\n - Modulate the script recipe to append in the PYTHONPATH all egg dependencies\n   found into the local eggs cache.\n\n0.0.10\n-------\n - Add pyc regeneration feature stolen from zc.buildout\n\n0.0.9\n-------\n - minor fix for run without minitage\n - fix for long path/compilation flags\n\n0.0.8\n-------\n - minor fix for scm check outs\n\n0.0.7\n-------\n - add C compiler cflags/ldflags/makeopts customistation options\n\n0.0.6\n-------\n - Change the eggs installation way to do, now using easy_install everywhere\n   Also include a buildout option to allow to include eggs dependencies (ez-dependencies-true)\n - Set the __doc__ variable in scripts to fix some scripts like bzr.\n\n0.0.3\n-------\n - fix scm choice when there are eggs and url in the same part\n\n0.0.2\n------\n - bugfix version\n - fix linking problem\n\n0.0.1\n------\n - Initial version",
