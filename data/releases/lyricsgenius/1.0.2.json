Check out [my blog post](http://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/) for a more thorough description of the package and its usage.\n\nTo use the Genius API you'll need to sign up for a (free) client that authorizes you to [access their API](http://genius.com/api-clients). You'll need to supply your `client_access_token` from Genius when using this module. See [Usage](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius#usage) below for an example.\n\n## Installation\n*LyricsGenius* requires Python 3.\n\nInstall the package via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lyricsgenius) using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install lyricsgenius\n```\n\nOr, install the latest version from GitHub:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git\n```\n\n## Usage\nImport the package and search for songs by a given artist:\n\n```python\nimport lyricsgenius as genius\napi = genius.Genius(\"my_client_access_token_here\")\nartist = api.search_artist(\"Andy Shauf\", max_songs=3)\n```\n\nSearch for a single song by the same artist:\n\n```python\nsong = api.search_song(\"To You\", artist.name)\n```\n\nAdd the song to the artist object:\n\n```python\nartist.add_song(song)\n```\n\nSave the artist's songs to a JSON file:\n\n```python\nartist.save_lyrics()\n```\n\nYou can also call the package from the command line:\n\n```bash\nexport GENIUS_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"my_client_access_token_here\"\npython3 -m lyricsgenius --help\n```\n\nSearch for and save lyrics to a given song:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lyricsgenius song \"Begin Again\" \"Andy Shauf\" --save\n```\n\nSearch for five songs by 'The Beatles' and save the lyrics:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lyricsgenius artist \"The Beatles\" --max-songs 5 --save\n```\n\n## Example projects\n\n  - [Textual analysis of popular country music](http://www.johnwmillr.com/trucks-and-beer/)\n  - [What makes some blink-182 songs more popular than others?](http://jdaytn.com/posts/download-blink-182-data/)\n  - [Words per song for rap, rock, and country music](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8j1r7b/words_per_song_for_rap_rock_and_country_music_oc/)\n  - [Sentiment analysis on hip-hop lyrics](https://github.com/Hugo-Nattagh/2017-Hip-Hop)\n\n  I'd love to have more examples to list here! Let me know if you've made use of this wrapper for one of your own projects, and I'll list it here.\n\n## Contributing\nPlease contribute! If you want to fix a bug, suggest improvements, or add new features to the project, just [open an issue](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius/issues) or send me a pull request.\n\n\n",
