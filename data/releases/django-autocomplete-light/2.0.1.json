It was\ndesigned for Django so that every part overridable or reusable independently.\nIt is stable, tested, documented and fully supported: it tries to be a good\nneighbour in Django ecosystem.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- charfield, foreign key, many to many autocomplete widgets,\n- generic foreign key, generic many to many autocomplete widgets,\n- django template engine support for autocompletes, enabling you to include\n  images etc ...\n- 100% overridable HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript: there is no variable\n  hidden far down in the scope anywhere.\n- add-another popup supported outside the admin too.\n- keyboard is supported with enter, tab and arrows by default.\n- Django 1.7, Python3 support\n\nEach feature has a live example and is fully documented. It is also designed\nand documented so that you create your own awesome features too.\n\nUpgrade from 1.x.x\n------------------\n\n**To upgrade to v2**, please enjoy the `v1 to v2 upgrade instructions\n<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/stable-2.x.x/1to2.html>`_\n(documented with love !).\n\n- the Autocomplete class design hasn't changed at all.\n- ``yourlabsWidget()`` doesn't parses ``data-*`` options the same,\n- the django/form python code has been re-organised ie.\n  ``get_widgets_dict()`` is gone and ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm``\n  wraps around all features by default.\n\nResources\n---------\n\nResources include:\n\n- `**Documentation** graciously hosted\n  <http://django-autocomplete-light.rtfd.org>`_ by `RTFD\n  <http://rtfd.org>`_\n- `Live demo graciously hosted\n  <http://jpic.pythonanywhere.com/>`_ by `PythonAnywhere\n  <http://pythonanywhere.com/>`_,\n- `Video demo graciously hosted\n  <http://youtu.be/fJIHiqWKUXI>`_ by `Youtube\n  <http://youtube.com>`_,\n- `Mailing list graciously hosted\n  <http://groups.google.com/group/yourlabs>`_ by `Google\n  <http://groups.google.com>`_\n- `Git graciously hosted\n  <https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/>`_ by `GitHub\n  <http://github.com>`_,\n- `Package graciously hosted\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-autocomplete-light/>`_ by `PyPi\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_,\n- `Continuous integration graciously hosted\n  <http://travis-ci.org/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light>`_ by `Travis-ci\n  <http://travis-ci.org>`_",
