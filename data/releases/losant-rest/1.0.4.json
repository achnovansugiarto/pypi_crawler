    "description": "# Losant Python REST API Client\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-rest-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-rest-python) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/losant-rest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/losant-rest)\n\nThe [Losant](https://www.losant.com) REST API client provides a simple way to\nuse the comprehensive Losant API.  You can authenticate either as a Losant\ndevice or with your user account, and have access to all the functionality\nof the Losant platform.\n\nThis client works with both Python 2.7 and 3. It uses\n[Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/) under the\ncovers for the actual HTTP communication.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Installation\n\nThe latest stable version is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi)\nand can be installed using\n\n```bash\npip install losant-rest\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n## Example\n\nBelow is a high-level example of using the Losant Python REST API client to\nauthenticate against the Losant Platform and report state for a device.\n\n```python\nfrom losantrest import Client\nfrom analog import AnalogSensor\n\nclient = Client()\ncreds = {\n    'deviceId': 'my-device-id',\n    'key': 'my-app-access-key',\n    'secret': 'my-app-access-secret'\n}\nresponse = client.auth.authenticate_device(credentials=creds)\n\nclient.auth_token = response['token']\napp_id = response['applicationId']\n\nstate = {'data': {'temperature': AnalogSensor.read()}}\nresponse = client.device.send_state(deviceId='my-device-id',\n    applicationId=app_id, deviceState=state)\n\nprint(response)\n\"\"\" {'success': True} \"\"\"\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n## API Documentation\n\n### Client\n\nA client is a single api instance.  By default, it is unauthenticated,\nbut can be given an access token to perform authenticated requests.\n\n#### Constructor\n\n```python\nClient(auth_token=None, url=\"https://api.losant.com\")\n```\n\nThe ``Client()`` constructor takes the following arguments:\n\n*   auth_token  \nThe access token to be used for authentication - by default there is no access\ntoken.  An access token can be acquired through either of\nthe [Auth](docs/auth.md) methods.\n\n*   url  \nThe url of the Losant API - by default <https://api.losant.com>.\n\n#### Properties\n\n*   auth_token  \nThe auth token can be accessed or changed after Client creation\nthrough this property.\n\n*   url  \nThe api base url can be accessed or changed after Client creation\nthrough this property.\n\n#### Resources\n\nEach of the following is a property on the client object, and returns\na wrapper for the actions against that particular resource.  See each\nresource documentation file for more information.\n\n*   [application_key](docs/applicationKey.md)  \nContains all the actions that can be performed against a single\n[Application Key](https://docs.losant.com/applications/access-keys/) -\nfor instance, getting info on a single key or revoking a key.\n\n*   [application_keys](docs/applicationKeys.md)  \nContains all of the actions that can be performed against the collection of\n[Application Keys](https://docs.losant.com/applications/access-keys/) belonging\nto an Application - such as listing all keys or creating a new key.\n\n*   [application](docs/application.md)  \nContains all of the actions that can be performed against a single\n[Application](https://docs.losant.com/applications/overview/),\nwhich include things like getting info on an application or\nmodifying an application.\n\n*   [applications](docs/applications.md)  \nContains all of the actions that can be performed against the set of\n[Applications](https://docs.losant.com/applications/overview/) that the\ncurrently authenticated user has access to - such as\nlisting the applications or creating a new application.\n\n*   [auth](docs/auth.md)  \nContains the actions used for authenticating against the api, either as a\nuser or as a device.
