Forget about rewriting notebooks to web frameworks just to share your results. Mercury offers a set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells.\n\nYou can build with Mercury:\n- Turn your notebook into beautiful [Web Apps](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook/),\n- Create interactive [Presentations](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/presentation-python-jupyter-notebook/) with widgets, you can recompute slides during the show,\n- Share notebooks as static [Websites](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/website-python-jupyter-notebook/),\n\n- Build data-rich [Dashboards](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/dashboard-python-jupyter-notebook/) with widgets,\n- Create [Reports](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/report-python-jupyter-notebook/) with PDF exports, automatic scheduling, and email notifications (coming soon),\n- Serve Python notebooks as [REST API](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/rest-api-python-jupyter-notebook/) endpoints (coming soon).\n\nMercury features:\n- add widgets with Python code - no frontend experience needed!\n- hide or show notebook's code,\n- export executed notebook to PDF or HTML,\n- share muplitple notebooks - no limits!\n- embed notebook on any website,\n- easy file upload and download from the notebook,\n- add authentication to notebooks (coming soon),\n- schedule automatic notebook execution (coming soon).\n\n## Example\n\nSimple code example that creates a widget and displays its value. You can interact with a widget in the Jupyter Notebook. Its value will be updated. However, to see the update in other cells you need to **manually execute** them.\n\nImport package:\n```python\nimport mercury as mr\n```\n\nCreate a [`Text`](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/text/) widget:\n```python\nname = mr.Text(value=\"Piotr\", label=\"What is your name?\")\n```\n\nPrint widget value:\n```python\nprint(f\"Hello {name.value}\")\n```\n\n#### Code in Jupyter Notebook\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<kbd>\n<img \n    alt=\"Web App from Notebook\"\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/visual-identity/main/mercury/hello-world-notebook-ola.png\"  />  \n</kbd>\n</p>\n\n#### Mercury App\n\nUse Mercury to run notebook as web application. **Cells are automatically re-executed** after widget change. Mercury re-executes only cells with widget definition and below it. In the example, cells 2 and 3 are re-executed after widget update. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<kbd>\n<img \n    alt=\"Web App from Notebook\"\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/visual-identity/main/mercury/hello-world-app-ola.gif\"  />  \n   </kbd>\n</p>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nðŸ“š Read more about Mercury on [RunMercury.com](https://RunMercury.com).\n\n## Installation\n\n*Compatible with Python 3.7 and higher.*\n\nInstall with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install mercury\n```\n\nInstall with `conda`:\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge mercury\n```\n\n\n## Demo\n\nRun Mercury with demo notebooks.\n\n```\nmercury run demo\n```\n\nPlease check [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see demo notebooks.\n\n\n## Mercury with your notebooks\n\nTo run Mercury with your notebook, please execute the following:\n\n```\nmercury run\n```\n\nThe command should be run in the same directory as notebooks. You can change code in Jupyter Notebook, and Mercury will **instantly** update web app.\n\n\n## Mercury License\n\nMercury is released with AGPL v3 license.\n\nLooking for dedicated support, a commercial-friendly license, and more features?
