It has a low number of features and a simple codebase, hence the name lowbar.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Installation \nInstall the latest stable release:\n```\npip install lowbar\n```\n<br />\n\nOr the development version (Undocumented):\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce you have lowbar installed, you can import it like any other module:\n```python3\nimport lowbar\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAnd initialize the bar:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.LowBar()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make the bar visible and set at 0%:\n```python3\nbar.new()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAfter completing some tasks, we can increase the bar's completion percentage:\n```python3\nbar.update(20)\n```\n\n<br />\n\nThe above function will immediately move the bar to 20%. To use a more smoother but slower animation:\n```python3\nbar.update_smooth(40)\n```\n***Note:** Since version 1.1.4, `update_smooth()` is no-longer fully blocking. It will run in a separate thread, so your program will continue it's execution while the bar is animating. However, calling another lowbar function during the animation will block the main thread to prevent visual glitches. To avoid this block, make sure to call `log()` before `update_smooth()`, not after. See issue [#5](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/issues/5)*\n\n<br />\n\nUsing `print()` or other similar functions will push the bar up, which doesn't look nice. To log messages without affecting the bar:\n```python3\nbar.log(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAnd finally, to clear the bar completely:\n```python3\nbar.clear()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nHere's an example usage of the bar:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.LowBar()\n\ncompletion = 0\nbar.new()\nfor i in range(10):\n    time.sleep(2) # This would be replaced with an actual task\n    bar.log(f\"Task {i+1} completed\")\n    completion += 10\n    bar.update_smooth(completion)\nbar.clear()\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nYou don't even need a loop:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.LowBar()\n\nbar.new()\ntime.sleep(1)\nbar.update_smooth(10)\ntime.sleep(2)\nbar.update_smooth(40)\ntime.sleep(2)\nbar.update_smooth(100)\nbar.clear()\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nThe bar can also be used with a context manager. It will automatically run `new()` at the start and `clear()` when exiting:\n```python3\nwith lowbar.LowBar() as bar:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    bar.update_smooth(10)\n    time.sleep(3)\n    bar.update_smooth(100)\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make things *even* more simpler, you can wrap lowbar around an interable. It will automatically calculate how much to increase the percentage by every loop:\n```python3\nfor i in lowbar.LowBar(range(100)):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n\n<br />\n\nlowbar will use `update()` by default when working with iterables. If you're only going to loop a few times, you can force lowbar to use `update_smooth()`:\n```python3\nfor i in lowbar.LowBar(range(6), smooth_iter=True):\n    time.sleep(1)\n```\n***Note:** You can't use `log()` when using lowbar with an iterable.*\n\n<br />\n\nYou can change the load fill and blank fill chars as well:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.LowBar(bar_load_fill=\"O\", bar_blank_fill=\".\")\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Contributing\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\nIf you wish to report a bug or suggest a feature, open an [issue](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/issues).\n\nIf you already have a fix for a bug, make a [pull request](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/pulls) directly.\n\nYou can also [vote on](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/discussions/4) already suggested features.\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines to follow.\n\nContributors are listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## License\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 AnnikaV9\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
