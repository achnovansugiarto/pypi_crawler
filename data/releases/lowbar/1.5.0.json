It has a low number of features and a simple codebase, hence the name lowbar.\n\n<br />\n\n#### lowbar has:\n- Automatic resizing\n- Manual progress management\n- Automatic progress management (As an iterable)\n- Text logging\n- Bar customization\n- Extremely low overhead\n- Small package size\n\n#### lowbar doesn't have:\n- Nested bars\n- Fancy animations\n- ETA calculations\n\n<br />\n\n## Requirements\n\n<br />\n\n- Python 3.7 or above. lowbar may support earlier versions, but this has not been tested.\n- A console that supports line feed `\\n` and carriage return `\\r`.\n\n<br />\n\n## Installation \n\n<br />\n\nInstall the latest stable release:\n```\npip install lowbar\n```\n\n<br />\n\nOr the development version:\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar\n```\n\n<br />\n\n## Usage\n\n<br />\n\nOnce you have lowbar installed, you can import it like any other module:\n```python3\nimport lowbar\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAnd initialize the bar:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.lowbar()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make the bar visible and set at 0%:\n```python3\nbar.new()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAfter completing some tasks, we can increase the bar's completion percentage:\n```python3\nbar.update(20)\n```\n\n<br />\n\nThe above function will immediately move the bar to 20%. To use a more smoother but slower animation:\n```python3\nbar.update_smooth(40)\n```\n***Note:** Since version 1.1.4, `update_smooth()` is no-longer fully blocking. It will run in a separate thread, so your program will continue it's execution while the bar is animating. However, calling another lowbar function during the animation will block the main thread to prevent visual glitches. To avoid this block, make sure to call `log()` before `update_smooth()`, not after. See issue [#5](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/issues/5)*\n\n<br />\n\nUsing `print()` or other similar functions will push the bar up, which doesn't look nice. To log messages without affecting the bar:\n```python3\nbar.log(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAnd finally, to clear the bar completely:\n```python3\nbar.clear()\n```\n\n<br />\n\nHere's an example usage of the bar:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.lowbar()\n\ncompletion = 0\nbar.new()\nfor i in range(10):\n    time.sleep(2) # This would be replaced with an actual task\n    bar.log(f\"Task {i+1} completed\")\n    completion += 10\n    bar.update_smooth(completion)\nbar.clear()\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nYou don't even need a loop:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.lowbar()\n\nbar.new()\ntime.sleep(1)\nbar.update_smooth(10)\ntime.sleep(2)\nbar.update_smooth(40)\ntime.sleep(2)\nbar.update_smooth(100)\nbar.clear()\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nThe bar can also be used with a context manager. It will automatically run `new()` at the start and `clear()` when exiting:\n```python3\nwith lowbar.lowbar() as bar:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    bar.update_smooth(10)\n    time.sleep(3)\n    bar.update_smooth(100)\n\nprint(\"Tasks complete!\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make things simpler, you can wrap lowbar around `range()` and turn it into an iterable. It will automatically calculate how much to increase the percentage by every loop:\n```python3\nfor i in lowbar.lowbar(range(100)):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make things even more simpler, you can pass an integer and lowbar will convert it into a range object for you:\n```python3\nfor i in lowbar.lowbar(100):\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n<br />\n\nlowbar will use `update()` by default when used as an iterable. If you're only going to loop a few times, you can force lowbar to use `update_smooth()`:\n```python3\nfor i in lowbar.lowbar(6, smooth_iter=True):\n    time.sleep(1)\n```\n***Note:** You can't use `log()` when using lowbar as an iterable.*\n\n<br />\n\nYou can also change the load fill and blank fill chars:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.lowbar(bar_load_fill=\"O\", bar_blank_fill=\".\")\n```\n\n<br />\n\nOr add a description text to the left side of the bar:\n```python3\nbar = lowbar.lowbar(bar_desc=\"Downloading...\")\n```\n***Note:** If the console is too small to accomodate both the bar and the description text, the text will be hidden.*\n\n<br />\n\n## Arguments\n\n<br />\n\n**`__init__()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Init function thats called when the lowbar object is created.**\n\nArgs:\n\n- bar_iter: A range object that lowbar will iterate through when `__iter__()` is called. If an integer is provided, lowbar will automatically convert it into a range object. Default: `0`\n- smooth_iter: A boolean switch which forced lowbar to use `update_smooth()` when iterating. Default: `False`\n- bar_load_fill: A string of size 1, which will be used to fill the bar as it loads. Default: `\"#\"`\n- bar_blank_fill: A string of size 1, which will be used to fill the part of the bar that isn't loaded yet. Default: `\"-\"`\n- bar_desc: A string, which will be displayed to the left of the bar. If the console is too small to accomodate both the bar and the desc, the desc will be hidden. Default: `\"\"`\n- remove_ends: A boolean switch which will hide the chars placed at both ends of the bar (`[` & `]`). Default: `False`\n\n<br />\n\n**`new()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Alias for `update(0)`**\n\n<br />\n\n**`update()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Increases or decreases the completed percentage and refreshes the bar, automatically resizing if the console size has changed.**\n\nArgs:\n\n- percentage: An integer value to set the completed percentage as. No default value.\n\n<br />\n\n**`update_smooth()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Same as `update()`, with a smoother but slower animation. Avoid using this function if execution speed is important for your. The completion percentage cannot be decreased with this function.**\n\nArgs:\n\n- percentage: An integer value to set the completed percentage as. Must be higher than the currently set value. No default value.\n\n<br />\n\n**`log()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Logs text to the console without affecting the bar.**\n\nArgs:\n\n- text: Any string. Any other type needs to be converted with `str()` before being passed to this function. No default value.\n\n<br />\n\n**`clear()` &nbsp; - &nbsp; Clears the currently running bar.**\n\n<br />\n\n## Contributing\n\n<br />\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\nIf you wish to report a bug or suggest a feature, open an [issue](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/issues).\n\nYou can also make a [pull request](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/pulls) directly if you already have the fix for a bug.\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines to follow.\n\nContributors are listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/AnnikaV9/lowbar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n\n<br />\n\n## License\n\n<br />\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 AnnikaV9\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
