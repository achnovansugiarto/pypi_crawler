Finally! \r\n\r\n[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mo-times.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/mo-times/)\r\n[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/klahnakoski/mo-times.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/klahnakoski/mo-times)\r\n [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/klahnakoski/mo-times/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/klahnakoski/mo-times?branch=dev)\r\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/mo-times)](https://pepy.tech/project/mo-times)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details \r\n\r\n`Date` is a simplified class for time manipulation. This library is intended for personal and business applications where assuming every solar day has 24 * 60 * 60 seconds is considered accurate. [See *GMT vs UTC* below](//#GMT%20vs%20UTC).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n* **All time is in GMT** - Timezone math is left to be resolved at the human endpoints: Machines should only be dealing with one type of time; without holes, without overlap, and with minimal context.\r\n* **Single time type** - There is no distinction between dates, datetime and times; all measurements in the time dimension are handled by one type called `Date`. This is important for treating time as a vector space.\r\n* **Standard range comparision** - All time range comparisons have been standardized to `min <= value < max`. The minimum is inclusive (`<=`), and the maximum is exclusive (`<`). \r\n\r\n\r\n## `Date` class \r\n\r\nThe `Date()` method will convert unix timestamps, millisecond timestamps, various string formats and simple time formulas to create a GMT time\r\n\r\n### `Date.now()`\r\n\r\nReturn `Date` instance with millisecond resolution (in GMT).\r\n\r\n### `Date.eod()` \r\n\r\nReturn end-of-day: Smallest `Date` which is greater than all time points in today. Think of it as tomorrow. Same as `now().ceiling(DAY)`\r\n\r\n### `Date.today()`\r\n\r\nThe beginning of today. Same as `now().floor(DAY)`\r\n\r\n### Date.range(min, max, interval)\r\n\r\nReturn an explicit list of `Dates` starting with `min`, each `interval` more than the last, but now including `max`.   Used in defining partitions in time domains.\r\n\r\n### `floor(duration=None)`\r\n\r\nThis method is usually used to perform date comparisons at the given resolution (aka `duration`). Round down to the nearest whole duration. `duration` as assumed to be `DAY` if not provided.\r\n\r\n### `format(format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")`\r\n\r\nJust like `strftime`\r\n\r\n### `milli`\r\n\r\nNumber of milliseconds since epoch\r\n\r\n### `unix`\r\n\r\nNumber of seconds since epoch\r\n\r\n\r\n### `add(duration)`\r\n\r\nAdd a `duration` to the time to get a new `Date` instance. The `self` is not modified.\r\n\r\n### `addDay()`\r\n\r\nConvenience method for `self.add(DAY)`\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Duration` class\r\n\r\nRepresents the difference between two `Dates`. There are two scales:\r\n\r\n*  **`DAY` scale** - includes seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks.\r\n*  **`YEAR` scale** - includes months, quarters, years, and centuries.\r\n\r\n### `floor(interval=None)`\r\n\r\nRound down to nearest `interval` size.\r\n\r\n### `seconds` \r\n\r\nreturn total number of seconds (including partial) in this duration (estimate given for `YEAR` scale)\r\n\r\n### `total_seconds()`\r\n\r\nSame as the `seconds` property\r\n\r\n### `round(interval, decimal=0)`\r\n\r\nReturn number of given `interval` rounded to given `decimal` places\r\n\r\n### `format(interval, decimal=0)`\r\n\r\nReturn a string representing `self` using given `interval` and `decimal` rounding\r\n\r\n\r\n# Time as an algebraic field\r\n\r\nThe `Date` and `Duration` objects are the point and vectors in a one dimensional vector space. As such, the `+` and `-` operators are allowed. Comparisons with (`>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<`) are also supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## GMT vs UTC\r\n\r\nThe solar day is he most popular timekeeping unit. This library chose GMT (UT1) for its base clock because of its consistent seconds in a solar day. UTC suffers from inconsistent leap seconds and makes time-math difficult, even while forcing us to make pedantic conclusions like some minutes do not have 60 seconds. Lucky for us Python's implementation of UTC (`datetime.utcnow()`) is wrong, and implements GMT: Which is what we use.\r\n\r\n## Error Analysis\r\n\r\nAssuming we need a generous leap second each 6 months (the past decade saw only 4 leap seconds), then GMT deviates from UTC by up to 1 seconds over 181 days (December to June, 15,638,400 seconds) which is an error rate `error = 1/15,638,400 = 0.000006395%`. If we want to call the error \"noise\", we have a 70dB signal/noise ratio. All applications that can tolerate this level of error should use GMT as their time basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
