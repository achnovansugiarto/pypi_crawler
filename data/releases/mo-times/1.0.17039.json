    "description": "``Date`` class\n==============\n\nA simplified date and time class for time manipulation. This library is\nintended for personal and business applications where assuming every\nsolar day has 24 \\* 60 \\* 60 seconds is considered accurate. `See *GMT\nvs UTC* below <#GMT%20vs%20UTC>`__.\n\nAssumptions\n-----------\n\n-  **All time is in GMT** - Timezone math is left to be resolved at the\n   human endpoints: Machines should only be dealing with one type of\n   time; without holes, without overlap, and with minimal context.\n-  **Single time type** - There is no distinction between dates,\n   datetime and times; all measurements in the time dimension are\n   handled by one type called ``Date``. This is important for treating\n   time as a vector space.\n-  **Exclusive ceiling time ranges** - All time comparisons have been\n   standardized to ``min <= value < max``. The minimum is inclusive, and\n   the maximum is excluded. (please word this better)\n\n``Date`` properties\n-------------------\n\n``Date()`` constructor\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``Date()`` method will convert unix timestamps, millisecond\ntimestamps, various string formats and simple time formulas to create a\nGMT time\n\n``now()`` staticmethod\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReturn ``Date`` instance with millisecond resolution (in GMT).\n\n``eod()`` staticmethod\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReturn end-of-day: Smallest ``Date`` which is greater than all time\npoints in today. Think of it as tomorrow. Same as ``now().ceiling(DAY)``\n\n``today()`` staticmethod\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe beginning of today. Same as ``now().floor(DAY)``\n\nrange(min, max, interval) staticmethod\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReturn an explicit list of ``Dates`` starting with ``min``, each\n``interval`` more than the last, but now including ``max``. Used in\ndefining partitions in time domains.\n\n``floor(duration=None)`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis method is usually used to perform date comparisons at the given\nresolution (aka ``duration``). Round down to the nearest whole duration.\n``duration`` as assumed to be ``DAY`` if not provided.\n\n``format(format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJust like ``strftime``\n\n``milli`` property\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNumber of milliseconds since epoch\n\n``unix`` property\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNumber of seconds since epoch\n\n``add(duration)`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAdd a ``duration`` to the time to get a new ``Date`` instance. The\n``self`` is not modified.\n\n``addDay()`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nConvenience method for ``self.add(DAY)``\n\n``Duration`` class\n==================\n\nRepresents the difference between two ``Dates``. There are two scales:\n\n-  **``DAY`` scale** - includes seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks.\n-  **``YEAR`` scale** - includes months, quarters, years, and centuries.\n\n``Duration()`` constructor\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCreate a new ``Duration`` by name, by formula, by ``timespan``, or (more\nrarely) number of milliseconds.\n\n``floor(interval=None)`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRound down to nearest ``interval`` size.\n\n``seconds`` property\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nreturn total number of seconds (including partial) in this duration\n(estimate given for ``YEAR`` scale)\n\n``total_seconds()`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSame as the ``seconds`` property\n\n``round(interval, decimal=0)`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReturn number of given ``interval`` rounded to given ``decimal`` places\n\n``format(interval, decimal=0)`` method\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReturn a string representing ``self`` using given ``interval`` and\n``decimal`` rounding\n\nTime Vector Space\n=================\n\nThe ``Date`` and ``Duration`` objects are the point and vectors in a one\ndimensional vector space respectively. As such, the ``+`` and ``-``\noperators are allowed. Comparisons with (``>``, ``>=',``\\ <=``,``\\ <\\`)\nare also supported.\n\nGMT vs UTC\n----------\n\nThe solar day is he most popular timekeeping unit. This library chose\nGMT (UT1) for its base clock because of its consistent seconds in a\nsolar day. UTC suffers from inconsistent leap seconds and makes\ntime-math difficult, even while forcing us to make pedantic conclusions\nlike some minutes do not have 60 seconds. Lucky for us Python's\nimplementation of UTC (``datetime.utcnow()``) is wrong, and implements\nGMT: Which is what we use.\n\nError Analysis\n--------------\n\nAssuming we need a generous leap second each 6 months (the past decade\nsaw only 4 leap seconds), then GMT deviates from UTC by up to 1 seconds\nover 181 days (December to June, 15,638,400 seconds) which is an error\nrate ``error = 1/15,638,400 = 0.000006395%``. If we want to call the\nerror \"noise\", we have a 70dB signal/noise ratio. All applications that\ncan tolerate this level of error should use GMT as their time basis.\n",
