Please check the updated tutorials and documentations from the links below.***\n\n# FLARE: Fast Learning of Atomistic Rare Events\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"527\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://github.com/mir-group/flare/blob/master/docs/images/Flare_logo.png?raw=true\">\n</p>\n\nFLARE is an open-source Python package for creating fast and accurate interatomic potentials. \n\n## Major Features\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/mir-group/flare/blob/development/docs/images/Flare_features.jpg?raw=true\">\n</p>\n\nNote:\n\nWe implement Sparse GP, all the kernels and descriptors in C++ with Python interface.\n\nWe implement Full GP, Mapped GP, RBCM, Squared Exponential kernel and 2+3-body descriptors in Python. \n\nPlease do NOT mix them.\n\n## Documentations and Tutorials\n\nDocumentation of the code can be accessed here: https://mir-group.github.io/flare\n\n[Applications using FLARE and gallery](https://mir-group.github.io/flare/related.html)\n\n### Google Colab Tutorials\n\n[FLARE (ACE descriptors + sparse GP)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rZ-p3kN5CJbPJgD8HuQHSc7ecmwZYse6).\nThe tutorial shows how to run flare with ACE and SGP on energy and force data, demoing \"offline\" training on the MD17 dataset and \"online\" on-the-fly training of a simple aluminum force field. All the trainings use yaml files for configuration.\n\n[FLARE (ACE descriptors + sparse GP) with LAMMPS](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qgGlfu1BlXQgSrnolS4c4AYeZ-2TaX5Y).\nThe tutorial shows how to compile LAMMPS with FLARE pair style and uncertainty compute code, and use LAMMPS for Bayesian active learning and uncertainty-aware molecular dynamics.\n\n[FLARE (ACE descriptors + sparse GP) Python API](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18_pTcWM19AUiksaRyCgg9BCpVyw744xv). \nThe tutorial shows how to do the offline and online trainings with python scripts.\nA video walkthrough of the tutorial, including detailed discussion of expected outputs, is available [here](https://youtu.be/-FH_VqRQrso).\n\n[FLARE (2+3-body + GP)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q2NCCQWYQdTW9-e35v1W-mBlWTiQ4zfT).\nThe tutorial shows how to use flare 2+3 body descriptors and squared exponential kernel to train a Gaussian Process force field on-the-fly.\n\n[Compute thermal conductivity from FLARE and Boltzmann transport equations](https://phoebe.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tutorials/mlPhononTransport.html).\nThe tutorial shows how to use FLARE (LAMMPS) potential to compute lattice thermal conductivity from Boltzmann transport equation method, with [Phono3py](https://phonopy.github.io/phono3py/) for force constants calculations and [Phoebe](https://mir-group.github.io/phoebe/) for thermal conductivities.\n\n[Using your own customized descriptors with FLARE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VzbIPmx1z-uygKstOYTj2Nqr53AMC5NL?usp=sharing). \nThe tutorial shows how to attach your own descriptors with FLARE sparse GP model and do training and testing.\n\nAll the tutorials take a few minutes to run on a normal desktop computer or laptop (excluding installation time).\n\n## Installation\n### Pip installation\nPlease check the [installation guide here](https://mir-group.github.io/flare/installation/install.html).\nThis will take a few minutes on a normal desktop computer or laptop.\n\n### Developer's installation guide\nFor developers, please check the [installation guide](https://mir-group.github.io/flare/installation/install.html#developer-s-installation-guide).\n\n### Compiling LAMMPS\nSee [documentation on compiling LAMMPS with FLARE](https://mir-group.github.io/flare/installation/lammps.html)\n\n### Trouble shooting\nIf you have problem compiling and installing the code, please check the [FAQs](https://mir-group.github.io/flare/installation/install.html#trouble-shooting) to see if your problem is covered. Otherwise, please open an issue or contact us.\n\n## System requirements\n### Software dependencies\n* GCC 9\n* Python 3\n* pip>=20\n\nMKL is recommended but not required. All other software dependencies are taken care of by pip.\n\nThe code is built and tested with Github Actions using the GCC 9 compiler. (You can find a summary of recent builds [here](https://github.com/mir-group/flare/actions).) Other C++ compilers may work, but we can't guarantee this.\n\n### Operating systems\nflare++ is tested on a Linux operating system (Ubuntu 20.04.3), but should also be compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems. If you run into issues running the code on Mac or Windows, please post to the [issue board](https://github.com/mir-group/flare/issues).\n\n### Hardware requirements\nThere are no non-standard hardware requirements to download the software and train simple models&mdash;the introductory tutorial can be run on a single cpu. To train large models (10k+ sparse environments), we recommend using a compute node with at least 100GB of RAM.\n    \n## Tests\nWe recommend running unit tests to confirm that FLARE is running properly on your machine. We have implemented our tests using the pytest suite. You can call `pytest` from the command line in the tests directory.\n\nInstructions (either DFT package will suffice):\n```\npip install pytest\ncd tests\npytest\n```\n\n## References\n- If you use FLARE++ including B2 descriptors, NormalizedDotProduct kernel and Sparse GP, please cite the following paper:\n\n  > [1] Vandermause, J., Xie, Y., Lim, J.S., Owen, C.J. and Kozinsky, B., 2021. *Active learning of reactive Bayesian force fields: Application to heterogeneous hydrogen-platinum catalysis dynamics.* [arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.01949](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01949).\n  \n- If you use FLARE active learning workflow, full Gaussian process or 2-body/3-body kernel in your research, please cite the following paper:\n\n  > [2] Vandermause, J., Torrisi, S.
