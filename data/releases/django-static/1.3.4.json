    "description": "About django-static\n===================\n\nWhat it does\n------------\n\n`django_static` is a Django app that enables as various template tags\nfor better serving your static content. It basically rewrites\nreferences to static files and where applicable it does whitespace\noptmization of the content. By making references to static content\nunique (timestamp included in the name) you can be very aggressive\nwith your cache-control settings without ever having to worry about\nupgrading your code and worrying about visitors using an older version.\n\nThe three template tags it enables are the following:\n\n1. `staticfile` Takes the timestamp of the file, and makes a copy by\n   symlinking as you define. You use it like this::\n   \n        <img src=\"{% staticfile \"/images/foo.png\" %}\"/>\n\t\n   and the following is rendered:\n   \n        <img src=\"/images/foo.123456789.png\"/>\n\t\n   ...assuming the epoch timestamp of the file is 123456789. \n   \n2. `slimfile` Works the same as `staticfile` but instead of copying\n   the file as a symlink it actually rewrites the file and compresses\n   it through [slimmer](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimmer/). This of\n   course only works for `.js` and `.css` files but it works\n   wonderfully fast and is careful enough to not break things. The\n   cool thing about doing this for `.css` files it finds all relative\n   images inside and applies `staticfile` for all of them too. You use\n   it just like `staticfile`:\n   \n        <script type=\"text/javascript\"\n          src=\"{% slimfile \"/javascript/myscript.js\" %}\"></script>\n\t  \n3. `slimcontent` is used to whitespace compress content right in the\n   template. It requires a format paramter which can be `\"js\"`,\n   `\"css\"` or `\"html\"`. So, for example for some inline CSS content\n   you do this:\n   \n        <style type=\"text/css\">\n        {% slimcontent \"css\" %}\n        h1, h2, h3 { \n\t    font-face:'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial; \n        }\n        {% endslimcontent %}\n        </style>\n\t\n   ...and you get this:\n   \n        <style type=\"text/css\">\n        h1,h2,h3{font-face:'Trebuchet MS',Verdana,Arial}\n        </style>\n\t\n\t\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n`django_static` will be disabled by default. It's not until you set\n`DJANGO_STATIC = True` in your settings module that it actually starts\nto work for you. \n\nBy default, when `django_static` slims files or makes symlinks with\ntimestamps in the filename, it does this into the same directory as\nwhere the original file is. If you don't like that you can override\nthe save location by setting\n`DJANGO_STATIC_SAVE_PREFIX = \"/tmp/django-static\"`\n\nIf you, for the sake of setting up your nginx/varnish/apache2, want\nchange the name the files get you can set\n`DJANGO_STATIC_NAME_PREFIX = \"/cache-forever\"` as this will make it easier\nto write a rewrite rule/regular expression that in\nnginx/varnish/apache2 deliberately sets extra aggressive caching. \n\nAnother option is to let django_static take care of setting your\n`MEDIA_URL`. You could do this:\n\n        <img src=\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}{% staticfile \"/foo.png\" %}\"/>\n\t\nBut if you're feeling lazy and what django_static to automatically\ntake care of it set `DJANGO_STATIC_MEDIA_URL`. In settings.py:\n\n        DJANGO_STATIC_MEDIA_URL = \"http://static.example.com\"\n\t\nIn your template:\n\n        <img src=\"{% staticfile \"/foo.png\" %}\"/>\n\t\nAnd you get this result:\n\n        <img src=\"http://static.example.com/foo.1247785534.png\"/>\n\t\n\t\nUsing Google Closure Compiler\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you want to use the [Google Closure\nCompiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) to optimize your\nJavascript files you first have to download the compiler.jar file and\nmake sure your systam can run java. Suppose you download it in\n/usr/local/bin, the set this variable in your settings.py file:\n\n        DJANGO_STATIC_CLOSURE_COMPILER = '/usr/local/bin/compiler.jar'\n        \nIf for some reason the compiler chokes on your Javascript it won't\nhalt the serving of the file but it won't be whitespace optimized and\nthe error will be inserted into the resulting Javascript file as a big\ncomment block.\n\nUsing the YUI Compressor\n------------------------\n\nThe [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) is\nboth a Javascript and CSS compressor which requires a java runtime.\nJust like the Google Closure Compiler, you need to download the jar\nfile and then set something like this in your settings.py:\n\n        DJANGO_STATIC_YUI_COMPRESSOR = '/path/to/yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar'\n\t\nIf you configure the Google Closure Compiler **and** YUI Compressor,\nthe Google Closure Compiler will be first choice for Javascript\ncompression.\n\nUsing the slimmer\n-----------------\n\n[slimmer](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimmer/) is an all python\npackage that is capable of whitespace optimizing CSS, HTML, XHTML and\nJavascript. It's faster than the YUI Compressor and Google Closure but\nthat speed difference is due to the start-stop time of bridging the\nJava files. \n\t\nHow to hook this up with nginx\n------------------------------\n\nRead [this blog entry on\npeterbe.com](http://www.peterbe.com/plog/serve-your-static-stuff-in-django-with-nginx)",
