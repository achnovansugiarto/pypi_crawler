    "description": "ll-core is a collection of the following modules::\r\n\r\n* ``ansistyle`` wraps an output stream and adds color capability\r\n  via ANSI escape sequences.\r\n\r\n* ``color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.\r\n  This includes the ability to convert between different color models\r\n  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions\r\n  for modifying and mixing colors.\r\n\r\n* ``make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows you\r\n  to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed\r\n  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one\r\n  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented\r\n  way and targets are not only limited to files, but you can implement\r\n  e.g. dependencies on database records.\r\n\r\n* ``misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.\r\n\r\n* ``sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.\r\n\r\n* ``url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396\r\n  compliant URLs.\r\n\r\n* ``xpit`` is a module that makes it possible to embed Python expressions\r\n  in text (as XML style processing instructions).",
