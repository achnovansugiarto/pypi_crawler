    "description": "\nMister Bump\n===========\n\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jongracecox/mister-bump.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/jongracecox/mister-bump\n   :alt: image\n\n\nSupported versions: Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n``mister_bump`` is a Python-based tool for handling version numbering in Git projects.\nIt can be used from within Python via import, or via the command line.\n\nThe idea is to automate the creation of version numbers within Git projects.  This can\nbe done by using the tool in a projects' CI/CD build pipeline.  \n\nIn order for the tool to work correctly you should use the versioning approach suggested\nbelow.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation can be done via ``pip``.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install mister_bump\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nOnce installed via pip, you can use the command line interface ``get-git-version``\\ , or ``mister-bump``.\n\nIf you have downloaded the project source, you can call ``mister_bump.py`` using the\nsame syntax.\n\n*Note: You must call the script from inside the root directory of the Git project you want the version for.*\n\nBasic call with no arguments:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   [08:18:39 user@localhost mister-bump]$ get-git-version \n   1.0.0rc1\n\nIn the above call, the **next** version to be created will be ``1.0.0rc1``.  So if\nthe Git project was pushed to master and the CI pipeline ran, the version used in CI\nwould be ``1.0.0rc1``. \n\nThe style can be changed to use ``.dev`` for development release (typically used as a post release version).\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   [08:19:16 user@localhost mister-bump]$ get-git-version --style .dev\n   1.0.0.dev1\n\nIt is possible to tell the script to **not** increment the detected version number.\nThis can be used for different versioning schemes.  For example, you may want to create\npost release versions, rather than pre-release versions.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   [08:19:24 user@localhost mister-bump]$ get-git-version --style .dev --no-increment\n   0.3.0.dev1\n\nIn this example the **last** version in Git is ``0.3.0``\\ , and the \"deviation\" (distance in commits)\nis 1 - meaning that there has been one additional commit since that version. \n\nVerbose output can be obtained by passing the ``--verbose`` argument.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   [08:19:31 user@localhost mister-bump]$ get-git-version --style rc --verbose\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:308][DEBUG] Fetching all candidate upstream versions\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:31][DEBUG] Getting current git version\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:38][DEBUG] Command: git describe --match=release-* --abbrev=4\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:312][DEBUG] Candidate versions: release-0.3.0-final-1-gc68c\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:322][DEBUG] Comparing candidate release-0.3.0-final-1-gc68c\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version type = final\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version major = 0\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version minor = 3\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version bugfix = 0\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version deviation = 1\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:141][DEBUG] Version hash = \n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:60][DEBUG] Current git branch is master\n   08:19:40 [mister_bump:86][DEBUG] Current branch is bugfix?

Must be in the format\n                           \"release-0.0.0-000-aaaaaa\".\n\n   optional arguments:\n     -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n     -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output.\n     -s {rc,.dev}, --style {rc,.dev}\n                           Style of suffix.\n     -n, --no-increment    Do not increment version number.\n\nA Suggested Versioning Approach\n-------------------------------\n\nThis is one way to do versioning, and it is the way that this tool was designed to work with.\nIf you have a different versioning approach this tool may not work as expected.\n\nPipeline Setup\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nMake sure the ``mister_bump`` package is installed where your CI pipeline will run.  This could be a case\nof installing on a server, adding the package to a Docker image, or simply ``pip`` installing it\nwithin the CI pipeline.\n\nNormally you add versioning because you want to deploy something as part of your CI pipeline.\nSet your pipeline up to perform deployment from the ``master`` branch (for release candidates),\nand ``release-*`` branches (for releases).  You can optionally add deployment for ``bugfix-*`` branches\nfor bugfix release candidates.  Do not perform deployment on ``release-*-final`` branches\n(more on that later), so add an exclusion for that too.\n\nIf your pipeline is running in GitLab CI then you can add this to your ``.gitlab-ci.yml``\\ :\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n     only:\n       - /^release-.*$/\n       - master\n       - /^bugfix-.*$/\n     except:\n       - /^release-.*-final$/\n\nIn your CI script you can get the version number into an environment variable using:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   export VERSION=$(get-git-version --style rc)\n   echo \"VERSION is $VERSION\"\n\nUse the ``$VERSION`` environment variable when creating artifacts.\n\nStarting out\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhen you first start version numbering on a project, there will be no tags, so the script\nwon't detect a \"current\" version.  In this instance it will always return ``0.1.0rc1``.\n\nYou can either leave it like this, and accept that all release candidates will be created\nwith the same version number up until the first release, or you can create a new\n``release-0.0.0`` tag on the project, which will mean each commit will\nresult in a new version number:\n\n\n* ``0.1.0rc1``\n* ``0.1.0rc2``\n* ``0.1.0rc3``\n\nIf you set your CI pipeline to deploy on master updates then you will have new project\nartifacts generated and deployed with each update to master.\n\n*Note that the ``N`` in ``rc<N>`` indicates a distance (in commits)from the last release tag, so if\nyou merge multiple commits into master at the same time this will only result in one CI pipeline\nrunning, and there will be gaps in the release candidate numbers*\n\n\n* Create tag ``release-0.0.0``\n* Create dev branch ``X``\n\n  * Commit 1 (distance of 1 commit)\n  * Commit 2 (distance of 2 commits)\n  * Commit 3 (distance of 3 commits)\n\n* Merge branch ``X`` into ``master``\n\n  * Master CI pipeline will create version ``0.1.0rc3`` (no ``rc1`` or ``rc2``\\ )\n\nReleasing a version\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**TL;DR** - Create tag ``release-X.Y.Z`` pointing to master\n\nEach master branch update will be a release candidate for the **next** release, so\n``0.1.0rc3`` is a *candidate* for the ``0.1.0`` release.  When you decide you are ready\nto cut a release simply create a new tag on the project.\n\nAssuming the last release candidate was ``0.1.0rc3``\\ , you would create a new tag called ``release-0.1.0``.\n\nIn GitLab you can do this through the web UI by clicking Repository > Tags, then click\nthe green **New tag** button, type in ``release-0.1.0``\\ , and make sure ``master`` is selected\nas the source branch.\n\nOnce the tag has been created, a new CI pipeline should run, and generate the artifacts for\nyour new release, with a version number of ``0.1.0``.\n\nAll subsequent commits to master will now be tagged as ``0.2.0rc<N>``\\ , as they are\ncontributing towards the next release.\n\n*NOTE: The tag names are key to how ``mister_bump`` works, so make sure you use the\ncorrect format (\\ ``release-<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>``\\ )* \n\nBugfixing\n^^^^^^^^^\n\n**TL;DR** - To fix ``X.Y.Z`` release create branch ``bugfix-X.Y.Z`` pointing to master,\n make changes, create tag ``release-X.Y.Z+1``. Cherry-pick fixes to master.\n\nThis section explains how to fix a bug in a previous release.  In the examples we will assume\nwe have released ``0.2.0`` (i.e. there is a ``release-0.2.0`` tag).  \n\nIn this instance we will be working to produce a ``0.2.1`` bugfix release.  You should think\nof ``0.2.1`` as a bugfix for ``0.2.0``.\n\n\n#. Create a branch called ``bugfix-<release-you-want-to-fix>``.  In our example this is\n   ``bugfix-0.2.0``.\n#. Develop your fix by committing to the bugfix branch.  As you go, each commit will result in\n   a ``0.2.1rc<N>`` version if your CI is setup to deploy on bugfix branch.\n#. Once your bugfix is ready to release create a tag for ``release-0.2.1``\\ , and base it on the\n   bugfix branch.  This will cause a new ``0.2.1`` version to be created in CI.\n#. Finally make sure all your fixes are **also** applied to master (either manually or via\n   cherry-picking)\n\nYou should now have something that looks like this:\n\n\n* Tag ``release-0.2.0``\n* Branch ``bugfix-0.2.0``\n\n  * Commit 1 (distance of 1 commit) - version = ``0.2.1rc1``\n  * Commit 2 (distance of 2 commits) - version = ``0.2.1rc2``\n  * Commit 3 (distance of 3 commits) - version = ``0.2.1rc3``\n  * Tag bugfix branch as ``release-0.2.1`` - version = ``0.2.1``\n\n* Cherry-pick commit 1 onto master\n* Cherry-pick commit 2 onto master\n* Cherry-pick commit 3 onto master\n\nBreaking change / Major release\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**TL;DR** - To close release ``X.Y.Z`` and move to ``X+1.0.0`` create tag ``release-X.Y.Z-final``\npointing to ``release-X.Y.Z``.\n\nMajor release numbers are typically reserved for breaking changes.  When you need to make a\nbreaking change, or just want to switch to a new major release (maybe due to a significant change)\nyou need to \"finalise\" the current major version, so you can move onto the next.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nLets assume we have the following released versions.\n\n\n* ``0.1.0rc1``\n* ``0.1.0rc2``\n* ``0.1.0rc3``\n* ``0.1.0`` (tag ``release-0.1.0``\\ )\n* ``0.2.0rc1``\n* ``0.2.0rc2``\n* ``0.2.0rc3``\n* ``0.2.0`` (tag ``release-0.2.0``\\ )\n\nIf we carry on as normal, and start committing changes to master, the next versions would be\n``0.3.0rc1``\\ , ``0.3.0rc2``\\ , ``0.3.0rc3``\\ , etc.\n\nLets say we want to make a breaking change, and want to start work on ``1.0.0``.  We need to\n\"close off\" the ``0`` major release number, and move onto major version ``1``.\n\nTo do this we need to create a ``final`` tag called ``release-0.2.0-final``\\ , pointing at ``release-0.2.0``.\n\nThis ``final`` tag shouldn't be used to cut a release, since it should be pointing to the same\nthing as the ``release-0.2.0`` tag.  It's just used to tell ``mister_bump`` that we have finished with\n``0.X.X``\\ , and we're ready to start ``1.0.0``.\n\nContinuing our earlier example, we would expect to see:\n\n\n* ``0.1.0rc1``\n* ``0.1.0rc2``\n* ``0.1.0rc3``\n* ``0.1.0`` (tag ``release-0.1.0``\\ )\n* ``0.2.0rc1``\n* ``0.2.0rc2``\n* ``0.2.0rc3``\n* ``0.2.0`` (tag ``release-0.2.0``\\ )\n* Now we want to make a breaking change\n* Tag ``release-0.2.0-final``\n* ``1.0.0.rc1``\n* ``1.0.0.rc2``\n* ``1.0.0.rc3``\n* ``1.0.0`` (tag ``release-1.0.0``\\ )\n* ``1.1.0rc1``\n* ``1.1.0rc2``\n* ``1.1.0rc3``\n* ``1.1.0`` (tag ``release-1.1.0``\\ )\n\nVersion numbers for Python packages\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you are using ``mister-bump`` to version a Python package, you can call the package directly from your ``setup.py``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   #!/usr/bin/python\n   from setuptools import setup\n   import mister_bump\n\n\n   setup(\n       name='<your-package-bame>',\n       description='<Your package description.>',\n       version=mister_bump.bump(style='rc'),\n       ...\n       )\n\nMultiple version numbers in one project\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn rare instances you may want to manage version numbers for multiple deliverables\nwithin one project, and you may want them to be versioned independently.  This is supported\nin ``mister-bump`` using the ``--prefix`` option.\n\nLets imagine you have two packages within your project: ``fred`` and ``barney``.  You could configure\nyour CI pipeline to build and deploy those packages independently, based on the branch / tag names.\nFor example, ``fred`` could be deployed from CI pipelines on tags starting with ``fred/``\n(e.g. ``fred/release-1.2.3``\\ ), and ``barney`` could be deployed from pipelines on branches starting with\n``barney/``.\n\nWhen running ``mister-bump``\\ , you can pass ``--prefix='fred/'``\\ , and ``mister-bump`` will fetch the latest\nversion for ``fred/``\\ , increment the version number (according to the documentation above), and return\nthe new version number.\n\nSome things to note:\n\n\n* If there is a ``/`` separating the prefix from the remainder of the tag, then you need to include\n  the trailing ``/``.\n* The version number returned by ``mister-bump`` will not include the prefix.  It will just be ``X.Y.ZrcN``\n\n\n",
