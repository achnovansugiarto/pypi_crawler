    "description": "Python client for McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator\n=============================================\n\nA straightforward wrapper around the ePO API. Manages authentication,\nbuilding requests, and interpreting responses. Simply treat the client\nobject as a callable function, passing the command name and parameters.\n\nInstall::\n\n    $ pip install mcafee-epo\n\nUse::\n\n    >>> from mcafee_epo import Client\n    >>> client = Client('https://localhost:8443', 'user', 'password')\n    >>> systems = client('system.find', '')\n\n\nDifferences from \"official\" client\n----------------------------------\n\nThis library was created in response to the fairly poor client\ndistributed by McAfee, which didn't support Python 3 and was generally\na mess. (You can find a cleaned up version of their client with Python 3\nsupport in the first few commits.)\n\nThe official library requires copying files into the Python location to\n\"install\" it. This library is an actual package installed using ``pip``.\n\nThe official client uses low level url libraries and numerous\nworkarounds to make http requests. This library uses the\n`requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ library to greatly simplify\nthe work the previous code was doing while offering better security.\n\nThe official client uses a dynamic command discovery and dispatch\nmechanism to make API calls seem like a nested set of objects. This\nlibrary forgoes that complexity (which wasn't understood by IDEs anyway)\nfor a more straightforward approach that just accepts command names when\ncalling.\n\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n-   Releases: https://pypi.org/project/mcafee-epo/\n-   Code: https://github.com/davidism/mcafee-epo\n\n\n",
