    "description": "Python client for McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator\n=============================================\n\nA straightforward wrapper around the ePO API.\nManages authentication, building requests, and interpreting responses.\nSimply treat the client object as a callable function, passing the command name and parameters.\n\nInstall::\n\n    $ pip install mcafee-epo\n\nUse::\n\n    >>> from mcafee_epo import Client\n    >>> client = Client('https://localhost:8443', 'user', 'password')\n    >>> systems = client('system.find', '')\n\nDifferences from \"official\" client\n----------------------------------\n\nThis library was created in response to the fairly poor client distributed by McAfee, which didn't support Python 3 and\nwas generally a mess.\n(You can find a cleaned up version of their client with Python 3 support in the first few commits.)\n\nThe official library required copying files into the Python location to \"install\" it.\nThis library is an actual package installed using ``pip``.\n\nThe official client uses low level url libraries and numerous workarounds to make http requests.\nThis library uses the `requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ library to greatly simplify the work the previous code\nwas doing.\n\nThe official client used a dynamic command discovery and dispatch mechanism to make api calls seem like a nested set of\nobjects.\nThis library forgoes that complexity (which wasn't understood by IDEs anyway) for a more straightforward approach that\njust accepts command names when calling.\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n* `PyPI releases <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mcafee-epo>`_\n* `Source code <https://bitbucket.org/davidism/mcafee-epo>`_\n",
