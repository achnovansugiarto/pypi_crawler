    "description": "\nmultilanguage Rabi-Ribi display\n===============================\n\n\n* MIT-licensed, 2017/02/19, ed@irc.rizon.net\n* https://ocv.me/stuff/md_rbrb.png\n* https://ocv.me/stuff/md_rbrb.mp4\n\nusage\n=====\n\n\n* install ``mecab.exe`` with **UTF-8 dictionary charset**\\ : http://taku910.github.io/mecab/#win\n* open a terminal: ``WIN+R`` ``cmd``\n* install md_rbrb: ``pip install md_rbrb``\n* run md_rbrb: ``md_rbrb`` (or maybe ``python -m md_rbrb``\\ )\n* visit http://127.0.0.1:8086/\n\nif you are running md_rbrb from the source code directory, disregard all the above (except for the mecab part) and just run ``start-md_rbrb.bat``\n\nhow it works\n============\n\n\n* it attaches to rabiribi.exe and uses hardcoded memory addresses to read out the currently visible dialogue line from the process memory\n* on each new line it parses the game's dialogue file from disk and reads out the japanese and english variant of said line\n* an httpd offers a document which displays the current dialogue line and autorefreshes to load new lines\n\nmaintainers\n===========\n\nif there's a new version of rabi-ribi and this script has died, open up the following file for reference along with cheatengine: ``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Rabi-Ribi\\localize\\event\\story_en.rbrb``\n\n\n* start a new game\n* tap past the first two lines of dialogue (\\ ``...`` and ``...?``\\ )\n* stop at the 3rd line (\\ ``Yawn...``\\ )\n* CTRL-F the dialogue line in story_en.rbrb, you'll see its block ID right above the search result\n* do a 4byte search for that ID (\\ ``10000``\\ ), you'll see a couple results\n* skip 3 lines ahead until just after the cutscene, then stop at the 1st line (\\ ``Wh-What is this place?``\\ )\n* do another search for the new ID (\\ ``10001``\\ ), now there's only two search results\n* add the 1st result to the code list by doubleclicking it, then rightclick it in the codelist and ``Pointerscan for this address``\\ , use default settings, hit OK and Yes (it'll only take like 44kB)\n* the top result will have \"\\ **Offset 0**\\ \" = ``0`` and the other offsets are blank, you just found ``ADR_BLOCK_ID`` which is the hexadecimal value under \"\\ **Base Address**\\ \"\n* without advancing the dialogue, start a new 4byte search for 0, then move one line ahead ingame and search for 1, then one more line and search for 2 etc until there's just one result with green text\n* pointerscan that result and grab the first result with \"\\ **Offset 0**\\ \" = ``0``\\ , that is ``ADR_BLOCK_POS``\n\nnote that if the dialogue box goes away for a camera pan or whatever then you have to start over since that makes it go back to 0, so do this with a dialogue scene that goes on for a bit uninterrupted\n\nchangelog\n=========\n\n\n* 2017/03/24: v1.1 for Rabi-Ribi v1.88\n* 2017/02/19: v1.0 for Rabi-Ribi v1.75\n",
