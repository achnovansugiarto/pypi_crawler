    "description": "django-councilmatic-notifications\n=================================\n\nThis is a Django app with notification functions for the `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_, a set of web apps for keeping tabs on local city council. It is built upon the open civic data standard, and ultimately makes Councilmatic easier to re-deploy in new cities.\n\nThe `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_ includes:\n\n- Philly Councilmatic (the original & first Councilmatic, by Mjumbe Poe. since it preceded django-councilmatic, it does not use django-councilmatic)\n- Chicago Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)\n- New York City Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)\n\nCouncilmatic in your city\n-------------------------\n\nIf you're interested in bringing Councilmatic to your city, `contact us <mailto:info@councilmatic.org>`_! We'd love to help.\n\nTeam\n----\n\n-  David Moore - project manager\n-  Forest Gregg - Open Civic Data (OCD) and Legistar scraping\n-  Cathy Deng - data models and loading\n-  Derek Eder - front end\n-  Eric van Zanten - search and dev ops\n\n\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nWe are continuing to improve django-councilmatic, & we welcome contributions in the form of `github issues <https://github.com/datamade/django-councilmatic/issues>`_ (bug reports, feature requests, general questions) & code contributions.\n\nHow to contribute code:\n\n- Fork the project\n- Make your feature addition or bug fix\n- Bonus points for running tests to check python style (:code:`pip install flake8` & then :code:`flake8 .`)\n- Send a pull request! Don't worry if it isn't perfect - think of a PR as a start of a conversation, rather than a finished product\n\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Participatory Politics Foundation and DataMade.\nReleased under the `MIT\nLicense <https://github.com/datamade/chi-councilmatic/blob/master/LICENSE>`__.",
