    "description": "==================================\nDjango Template Coverage.py Plugin\n==================================\n\nA `coverage.py`_ plugin to measure test coverage of Django templates.\n\nSupported Python versions: 2.7, and 3.6 through 3.10.\n\nSupported Django versions: 1.8, 1.11, 2.x and 3.x.\n\nSupported coverage.py versions: 4.x or higher.\n\nThe plugin is pip installable::\n\n    $ pip install django_coverage_plugin\n\nTo run it, add this setting to your ``.coveragerc`` file::\n\n    [run]\n    plugins = django_coverage_plugin\n\nThen run your tests under `coverage.py`_.\n\nYou will see your templates listed in your coverage report along with\nyour Python modules. Please use `coverage.py`_ v4.4 or greater to allow\nthe plugin to identify untested templates.\n\nIf you get a :code:`django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error,\nyou need to set the :code:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.\n\nTemplate coverage only works if your Django templates have debugging enabled.\nIf you get :code:`django_coverage_plugin.plugin.DjangoTemplatePluginException:\nTemplate debugging must be enabled in settings`, or if no templates get\nmeasured, make sure you have :code:`TEMPLATES.OPTIONS.debug` set to True in\nyour settings file:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    TEMPLATES = [\n        {\n            ...\n            'OPTIONS': {\n                'debug': True,\n            },\n        },\n    ]\n\n\nConfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Django template plugin uses some existing settings from your\n.coveragerc file.  The ``source=``, ``include=``, and ``omit=`` options\ncontrol what template files are included in the report.\n\nThe plugin can find unused template and include them in your results.  By\ndefault, it will look for files in your templates directory with an extension\nof .html, .htm, or .txt.  You can configure it to look for a different set of\nextensions if you like::\n\n    [run]\n    plugins = django_coverage_plugin\n\n    [django_coverage_plugin]\n    template_extensions = html, txt, tex, email\n\n\nCaveats\n~~~~~~~\n\nCoverage.py can't tell whether a ``{% blocktrans %}`` tag used the\nsingular or plural text, so both are marked as used if the tag is used.\n\n\nWhat the? How?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe technique used to measure the coverage is the same that Dmitry\nTrofimov used in `dtcov`_, but integrated into coverage.py as a plugin,\nand made more performant. I'd love to see how well it works in a real\nproduction project. If you want to help me with it, feel free to drop me\nan email.\n\nThe coverage.py plugin mechanism is designed to be generally useful for\nhooking into the collection and reporting phases of coverage.py,\nspecifically to support non-Python files.  If you have non-Python files\nyou'd like to support in coverage.py, let's talk.\n\n\nTests\n~~~~~\n\nTo run the tests::\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ tox\n\n\nHistory\n~~~~~~~\n\nv2.0.1 --- 2021-10-06\n---------------------\n\nTest and claim our support on Python 3.10.\n\nv2.0.0 --- 2021-06-08\n---------------------\n\nDrop support for Python 3.4 and 3.5.\n\nA setting is available: ``template_extensions`` lets you set the file\nextensions that will be considered when looking for unused templates\n(requested in `issue 60`_).\n\nFix an issue on Windows where file names were being compared\ncase-sensitively, causing templates to be missed (`issue 46`_).\n\nFix an issue (`issue 63`_) where tag libraries can't be found if imported\nduring test collection. Thanks to Daniel Izquierdo for the fix.\n\n.. _issue 46: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/46\n.. _issue 60: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/60\n.. _issue 63: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/63\n\nv1.8.0 --- 2020-01-23\n---------------------\n\nAdd support for:\n\n- Coverage 5\n\nv1.7.0 --- 2020-01-16\n---------------------\n\nAdd support for:\n\n- Python 3.7 & 3.8\n- Django 2.2 & 3.0\n\nv1.6.0 --- 2018-09-04\n---------------------\n\nAdd support for Django 2.1.\n\n\nv1.5.2 --- 2017-10-18\n---------------------\n\nValidates support for Django version 2.0b1. Improves discovery of\ntemplate files.\n\n\nv1.5.1a --- 2017-04-05\n----------------------\n\nValidates support for Django version 1.11. Testing for new package\nmaintainer Pamela McA'Nulty\n\n\nv1.5.0 --- 2017-02-23\n---------------------\n\nRemoves support for Django versions below 1.8.  Validates support for\nDjango version 1.11b1\n\n\nv1.4.2 --- 2017-02-06\n---------------------\n\nFixes another instance of `issue 32`_, which was the result of an\ninitialization order problem.\n\n\n\nv1.4.1 --- 2017-01-25\n---------------------\n\nFixes `issue 32`_, which was the result of an initialization order\nproblem.\n\n.. _issue 32: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/32\n\n\n\nv1.4 --- 2017-01-16\n-------------------\n\nDjango 1.10.5 is now supported.\n\nChecking settings configuration is deferred so that settings.py is\nincluded in coverage reporting.  Fixes `issue 28`_.\n\nOnly the ``django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates`` template\nengine is supported, and it must be configured with\n``['OPTIONS']['debug'] = True``. Fixes `issue 27`_.\n\n.. _issue 28: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/28\n.. _issue 27: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/27\n\n\n\nv1.3.1 --- 2016-06-02\n---------------------\n\nSettings are read slightly differently, so as to not interfere with\nprograms that don't need settings.  Fixes `issue 18`_.\n\n.. _issue 18: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/18\n\n\n\nv1.3 --- 2016-04-03\n-------------------\n\nMultiple template engines are allowed.  Thanks, Simon Charette.\n\n\n\nv1.2.2 --- 2016-02-01\n---------------------\n\nNo change in code, but Django 1.9.2 is now supported.\n\n\n\nv1.2.1 --- 2016-01-28\n---------------------\n\nThe template debug settings are checked properly for people still using\n``TEMPLATE_DEBUG`` in newer versions of Django.\n\n\n\nv1.2 --- 2016-01-16\n-------------------\n\nCheck if template debugging is enabled in the settings, and raise a\nvisible warning if not.  This prevents mysterious failures of the\nplugin, and fixes `issue 17`_.\n\nPotential Django 1.9 support is included, but the patch to Django hasn't\nbeen applied yet.\n\n.. _issue 17: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/17\n\n\n\nv1.1 --- 2015-11-12\n-------------------\n\nExplicitly configure settings if need be to get things to work.\n\n\n\nv1.0 --- 2015-09-20\n-------------------\n\nFirst version :)\n\n.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage\n.. _dtcov: https://github.com/traff/dtcov",
