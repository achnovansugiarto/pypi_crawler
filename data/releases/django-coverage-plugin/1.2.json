    "description": ".. Licensed under the Apache License: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n.. For details: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/blob/master/NOTICE.txt\n\n==================================\nDjango Template Coverage.py Plugin\n==================================\n\nA `coverage.py`_ plugin to measure the coverage of Django templates.\n\n| |license| |versions| |djversions| |status|\n| |kit| |downloads|\n\nSupported Python versions are 2.7 and 3.4.  Supported Django versions are 1.4\nthrough 1.8.\n\nThe plugin itself is pip installable::\n\n    $ pip install django_coverage_plugin\n\nTo run it, add this setting to your .coveragerc file::\n\n    [run]\n    plugins =\n        django_coverage_plugin\n\nThen run your tests under coverage.py. It requires coverage.py 4.0.\n\nYou will see your templates listed in your coverage report along with your\nPython modules.\n\nIf you get a django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured error, you need to set\nthe DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable.\n\n\nConfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Django template plugin uses some existing settings from your .coveragerc\nfile.  The ``source=``, ``include=``, and ``omit=`` options control what\ntemplate files are included in the report.\n\n\nCaveats\n~~~~~~~\n\nFiles included by the ``{% ssi %}`` tag are not included in the coverage\nmeasurements.\n\nCoverage.py can't tell whether a ``{% blocktrans %}`` tag used the singular or\nplural text, so both are marked as used if the tag is used.\n\n\nChanges\n~~~~~~~\n\n\nv1.2 --- 2016-01-16\n-------------------\n\nCheck if template debugging is enabled in the settings, and raise a visible\nwarning if not.  This prevents mysterious failures of the plugin, and fixes\n`issue 17`_.\n\nPotential Django 1.9 support is included, but the patch to Django hasn't been\napplied yet.\n\n.. _issue 17: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/17\n\n\nv1.1 --- 2015-11-12\n-------------------\n\nExplicitly configure settings if need be to get things to work.\n\n\nv1.0 --- 2015-09-20\n-------------------\n\nFirst version :)\n\n\nWhat the? How?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe technique used to measure the coverage is the same that Dmitry Trofimov\nused in `dtcov`_, but integrated into coverage.py as a plugin, and made more\nperformant. I'd love to see how well it works in a real production project. If\nyou want to help me with it, feel free to drop me an email.\n\nThe coverage.py plugin mechanism is designed to be generally useful for hooking\ninto the collection and reporting phases of coverage.py, specifically to\nsupport non-Python files.  If you have non-Python files you'd like to support\nin coverage.py, let's talk.\n\n\nTests\n~~~~~\n\nTo run the tests::\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ tox\n\n\n.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage\n.. _dtcov: https://github.com/traff/dtcov\n\n\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/django_coverage_plugin.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: License\n.. |versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/django_coverage_plugin.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: Python versions supported\n.. |djversions| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8-44b78b.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: Django versions supported\n.. |status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/django_coverage_plugin.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: Package stability\n.. |kit| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django_coverage_plugin.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: PyPI status\n.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/django_coverage_plugin.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_coverage_plugin\n    :alt: Monthly PyPI downloads\n",
