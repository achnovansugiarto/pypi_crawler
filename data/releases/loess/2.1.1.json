Note that the values are\n    weighted by a Gaussian function of their distance from the point under \n    consideration. This implies that the effective fraction of points \n    contributing to a given value is much smaller that ``frac``.\nnpoints: int, optional\n    Number of points to consider in the local approximation.\n    This is an alternative to using ``frac=npoints/x.size``.\nrotate: bool, optional\n    Rotate the ``(x, y)`` coordinates to have the maximum variance along the\n    ``x`` axis. This is useful to give comparable contribution to the\n    errors in the ``x`` and ``y`` variables. It can be used to asses the\n    sensitivity of the solution to the assumption that errors are only in ``y``.\nsigy: array_like with shape (n,)\n    1-sigma errors for the ``y`` values. If this keyword is used\n    the biweight fit is done assuming those errors. If this keyword\n    is *not* used, the biweight fit determines the errors in ``y``\n    from the scatter of the neighbouring points.\n\nOutput Parameters\n-----------------\n\nxout: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector of ``x`` coordinates for the ``yout`` values.\n    If ``rotate=False`` (default) then ``xout=x``.\n    \n    When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates then ``xout=xnew``\n    and both have shape ``(m,)``.\nyout: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector of smoothed ``y`` values at the coordinates ``xout``.\n    \n    When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates this contains the\n    smoothed values at the coordinates ``xnew`` and has shape ``(m,)``.\nwout: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector of biweights used in the local regressions. This can be used to\n    identify outliers: ``wout=0`` for outliers with deviations ``>4sigma``.\n    \n    When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates, this output is\n    meaningless and is arbitrarily set to unity.\n\n###########################################################################\n\nloess_2d\n========\n\nPurpose\n-------\n\nTwo-dimensional LOESS smoothing via robust locally-weighted regression.\n\nThis function is the implementation by `Cappellari et al.

Note that the values are\n    weighted by a Gaussian function of their distance from the point under\n    consideration. This implies that the effective fraction of points\n    contributing to a given value is much smaller that ``frac``.\nnpoints: int, optional\n    Number of points to consider in the local approximation.\n    This is an alternative to using ``frac=npoints/x.size``.\nrescale: bool, optional\n    Rotate the ``(x, y)`` coordinates to make the ``x`` axis the axis of\n    maximum variance. Subsequently scale the coordinates to have equal\n    variance along both axes. Then perform the local regressions.\n    This is recommended when the distribution of points is elongated or\n    when the units are very different for the two axes.\nsigz: array_like with shape (n,)\n    1-sigma errors for the ``z`` values. If this keyword is used\n    the biweight fit is done assuming these errors.

In the latter case\n    ``zout`` has shape ``(m,)``.\nwout: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector of biweights used in the local regressions. This can be used to\n    identify outliers: ``wout=0`` for outliers with deviations ``>4sigma``.\n\n    When passing as input the ``(xnew, ynew)`` coordinates, this output is\n    meaningless and is arbitrarily set to unity.\n\n###########################################################################\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nOther/Proprietary License\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2021 Michele Cappellari\n\nThis software is provided as is without any warranty whatsoever.\nPermission to use, for non-commercial purposes is granted.\nPermission to modify for personal or internal use is granted,\nprovided this copyright and disclaimer are included in all \ncopies of the software.
