affinity + eluted ligands.\n* Separate ligand prediction from the previous version is removed.\n* Binding score is reported as the log transformed binding affinity: `1 - log50k(affinity)`.\n\n###

About\nMHCLovac is MHC binding prediction method that focuses on physicochemical properties of peptides responsible for interaction with MHC molecules.\nThis method is based on modeling physicochemical properties of peptides in a way that captures the nearest neighbor effect of amino acid residues. \nIn other words, the method is based on the following assumption: physicochemical properties of adjacent amino acid residues have additive effect on the local properties of the peptide as a whole, and properties of a single residue affect the properties of the peptide at the neighboring positions.\nUsing this approach each peptide is represented by a set of modeled physicochemical profiles (distributions of certain property, figure 1, upper subplots) which are further reduced to predetermined number of discrete data points to obtain discrete physicochemical profiles (figure 1, bottom subplots). \nDiscrete profiles are used as input features for binding prediction models.\nThis method allows for direct comparison of physicochemical profiles of peptides of different sequence lengths. \n\n![mhclovac-modeling-method-figure.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefs304/mhclovac/master/research/figures/mhclovac-modeling-figure.png)\n\n### Materials\nTraining data was obtained from NetMHCPan 4.1 [(Reynisson, B. et. al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa379) website and contains preprocessed binding affinity and eluted ligand data.\nIn addition, binding affinity data was obtained directly from IEDB [(Vita R et. al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1006), and this dataset was used to narrow down the set of physicochemical indexes which are used for prediction. \nThe list of physicochemical properties and corresponding amino acid index data was obtained from the AAindex database [(Kawashima, S. et. al, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm998). \n\n### Methods\nMHCLovac uses a collection of out-of-the-box regression algorithms from `scikit-learn` python library with mostly default parameters.\nThe prediction model returns binding scores in form of log transformed binding affinity (1 â€“ log50k(affinity)). \nInput features for prediction models are discrete physicochemical profiles of peptides. \nSince the AAindex database contains more than 500 entries, to reduce the number of physicochemical properties needed to model, the following selection method is implemented: \nfor each physicochemical property index, the binding model was trained and evaluated using r2 score for each MHC allele, and the average score across all alleles was calculated. \nThe indexes were sorted based on the average score in descending order. \nStarting from the highest scoring index (selected by default), each next index was compared to the previously selected ones for correlation coefficient. \nOnly if correlation coefficients with all indexes from selection were in range [-0.3, 0.3] the new index was added to the selection. \nThis resulted in total of 9 indexes (table 1) which had high prediction potential for most alleles and were also low-correlated between themselves. \n\n| Accession number  | Title | Average r2 score |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| ROSM880102  | Side chain hydropathy, corrected for solvation (Roseman, 1988)  | 0.2819 |\n| ZIMJ680104  | Isoelectric point (Zimmerman et al., 1968)  | 0.2740 |\n| OOBM770104  | Average non-bonded energy per residue (Oobatake-Ooi, 1977)  | 0.2498 |\n| SNEP660101  | Principal component I (Sneath, 1966)  | 0.2454 |\n| ROBB760111  | Information measure for C-terminal turn (Robson-Suzuki, 1976)  | 0.2353 |\n| CHAM830102  | A parameter defined from the residuals obtained from the best correlation of the Chou-Fasman parameter of beta-sheet (Charton-Charton, 1983)  | 0.2062 |\n| RACS820104  | Average relative fractional occurrence in EL(i) (Rackovsky-Scheraga, 1982)  | 0.1833 |\n| WERD780103  | Free energy change of alpha(Ri) to alpha(Rh) (Wertz-Scheraga, 1978)  | 0.1704 |\n| KARS160120  | Weighted minimum eigenvalue based on the atomic numbers (Karkbara-Knisley, 2016) | 0.1413 |\n\n### Results\nPrediction is evaluated using FRANK method from NetMHCPan 4.1 paper. \nDataset was also obtained from NetMHCPan website and contains some 1600 sequences and corresponding epitopes of which 200 were randomly selected for this benchmark. \nFRANK score measures the fraction of non-epitopes scoring higher than the epitope (from same sequence), and the best possible score is 0.\n\n![mhclovac-4-0-benchmark.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefs304/mhclovac/master/research/figures/mhclovac-benchmark.png)\n\n###
