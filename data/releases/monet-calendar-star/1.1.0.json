    "description": ".. contents::\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe *Monet Calendar* suite (also *monet.calendar.star*) is a complete event managing solution for Plone,\ninspired by needs of the `City of Modena`__. Is widely used for managing all kind of events.\n\n__ http://www.comune.modena.it/\n\nThis is only a transitional package, for downloading and installing all other products in the suite\nin a simple way.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nWe want to give to Plone an event type that:\n\n* hide totally the \"time\" data (managed as simple text)\n* give a closed (but configurable) set of type of events\n* the days of weeks where really the event take place\n* be able to manage special days where the event *don't* take place\n* a lot of additional text information\n\nSee the `monent.calendar.event page`__ for know how to configure the event.\n\n__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monet.calendar.event\n\nAdditionally one or more Plone folder can be marked as \"*Calendar section*\" in a new \"Calendar\" menu.\n\n.. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/monet.calendar.suite-1.0.0-01.png\n   :alt: The new Calendar menu\n\n   Entries inside the new \"Calendar menu\"\n\nThis mean that this folder can use the \"*Calendar view*\" that show events in the current day, taken\n(by default, see below) from all the site events. This search take care of counting exceptions and\ndays of the week of events.\n\n.. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/monet.calendar.suite-1.0.0-02.png\n   :alt: Single day view\n\n   The \"Calendar view\"\n\nEvery event (and the also calendar sections) will also show a new \"search\" section at the top. This\nform can be used to perform a search on events of the calendar.\n\n.. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/monet.calendar.suite-1.0.0-03.png\n   :alt: As new events looks like\n\n   The search form on events\n\nThe form can be used to expand the search to more than one day, showing a summary of all events, per-day\n\n.. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/monet.calendar.suite-1.0.0-04.png\n   :alt: Search results on multiple days\n\n   Search results on multiple days\n\nUse multiple calendar: \"Calendar root\" sections\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nUsing again the \"*Calendar menu*\" you can also mark folder as \"Calendar root\".\nThis is useful when using a Plone filled of subsites, where you can have a *main calendar* that\nlook at every event in the site, but also additional sub-calendars (inside many calendar roots).\n\nWhen a calendar perform searches inside a Calendar root, it will only look for events inside the\ncalendar root itself\n\n.. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/monet.calendar.suite-1.0.0-05.png\n   :alt: Search results on multiple days\n\n   Same search above, but on a local calendar\n   (\"Subsite 1\" there is a \"Calendar root\" section)\n\nNew calendar portlet\n--------------------\n\nThe calendar construction is expensive, and not good to be used in a portlet of the site, where is\nvisible (in the worst case, also not cached) in every page of the site.\n\nWhen you install the monet.calendar.extension product, the calendar portlet is replaced with a version\nthat:\n\n* not show anymore events in a specific day\n* every cell is a link that perform a day-search in the nearest calendar\n\n\"*Nearest calendar*\" mean that if the visitor is inside a \"calendar root\" section he will be moved to\nthe calendar of that section, otherwise a global calendar section will be used.\n\nYou can also install an additional portlet from the `monet.calendar.portlet`__ product. This portlet \ngives you a way to select a calendar section in the site, then display it in a portlet (in the same way\nyou can see him in the calendar section itself).\n\n__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monet.calendar.portlet\n\n.. Note::\n   The portlet is designed to be used with `collective.portletpage`__. Using it in a narrow column portlet\n   must be fixed by your Plone theme!\n\n__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.portletpage\n\nSpecial event types\n-------------------\n\nFrom ZMI (see also `monet.calendar.event`__ configuration) you can specify one or more event type\nas \"special\". Those are then highlighted in the single day view, below the categorizations done for\nthe time of event.\n\n__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monet.calendar.event\n\nExamples:\n\n* Morning\n* Afternoon\n* Evening\n* *YouEventType*\n\nPlone4Artists Calendar integration\n----------------------------------\n\nThe suite were originally done for working with p4a.calendar. The compatibility code is still there,\nbut has not been tested in latests releases.\n\nDependencies tree\n=================\n\nYou can freely install single components of the suite, that are:\n\n* monet.recurring_event\n\n  * p4a.plonecalendar (optional, see above)\n\n  * rt.calendarinandout\n\n    * collective.js.jqueryui\n\n* monet.calendar.event\n\n* monet.calendar.extensions\n\n* monet.calendar.portlet (optional, see above)\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThe monet.calendar.star solution works onto:\n\n* Plone 3.2\n* Plone 3.3\n* Plone 4\n\nUnder Plone 4 the integration with the \"Sunburst theme\" is not perfect.\nSee also `#11474`__.\n\n__ http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11474\n\nCredits\n=======\n  \nDeveloped with the support of `Rete Civica Mo-Net - Comune di Modena`__;\nRete Civica Mo-Net supports the `PloneGov initiative`__.\n\n.. image:: http://www.comune.modena.it/grafica/logoComune/logoComunexweb.jpg \n   :alt: Comune di Modena - logo\n\n__ http://www.comune.modena.it/\n__ http://www.plonegov.it/\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nThis product was developed by RedTurtle Technology team.\n\n.. image:: http://www.redturtle.net/redturtle_banner.png\n   :alt: RedTurtle Technology Site\n   :target: http://www.redturtle.net/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.1.0 (2011-05-10)\n------------------\n\n* Added to the suite the new ``monet.calendar.portlet`` product [keul]\n* updated documentation [keul]\n\n1.0.0 (2011-03-18)\n------------------\n\n* first release",
