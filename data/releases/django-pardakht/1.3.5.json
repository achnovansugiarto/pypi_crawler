    "description": "django-pardakht\n===============\n\n**What's this?**\n\nYou can use this app to create payments in your django project via Iranian gateways. (Right now only Zarinpal is available but the rest are coming soon)\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nYou ask the app for a new payment and it will give you a link on your own site that you can redirect users to it in order to have a payment.\n\n.. image:: http://img.majidonline.com/pic/321293/1.png\n\n.. image:: http://img.majidonline.com/pic/321294/2.png\n\n.. image:: http://img.majidonline.com/pic/321295/3.png\n\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. ``pip install django-pardakht``\n\n2. Add ``pardakht`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n\n3. ``python manage.py migrate``\n\n4. Add ``pardakht`` urls to your project's urls.\n\n::\n\n    from pardakht import urls as pardakht_urls\n    urlpatterns = [\n        ...\n    \n        url(r'^<SOME_URL>/', include(pardakht_urls)),\n    \n        ...\n    ]\n\n5. For any gateway you use, add GATEWAY_MERCHANT_ID in your project settings. For example if you are going to use zarinpal, You need to add ``ZARINPAL_MERCHANT_ID`` in your settings with value set to your zarinpal merchant ID.\n\n\n**Usage**\n\nEvery payment you create takes 5 parameters.\n\n1. ``price``:  Price of the payment.\n\n2. ``description``:  Short description about this payment. Necessary for some gateways such as Zarinpal.\n\n3. ``return_function``:  A callable object (function) that will get called after payment is done with the payment object as it's input. It's optional and can be None.\n\n4. ``return_url``:  A url for user to come back where he left off on your site. It's optional and can be None.\n\n5. ``login_required``:  Must be True if user who is paying should be authenticated. If you're going to use this you have to set LOGIN_URL in project settings.\n\nTo create a payment:\n\n::\n\n    from pardakht import handler\n    result = handler.create_payment(\n        price,\n        description,\n        return_function,\n        return_url,\n        login_required\n    )\n\nThis will create a payment and returns a dict containing payment object and a link to pay it:\n\n::\n\n    result['payment']   #  Created payment object\n    result['link']      #  Link for paying this payment that you should redirect your user to\n\n**Extra notes**\n\nThis app handles all steps of payment including UI parts.\n\nIt uses semantic-ui so if you want to use it you need to serve app's static files.\n\nBut of course you can override templates to use your own templates with your own UI design.",
