    "description": "# dlib C++ library [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib)\n\nDlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.\n\n\n\n## Compiling dlib C++ example programs\n\nGo into the examples folder and type:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; cmake --build .\n```\n\nThat will build all the examples.\nIf you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .\n```\n\nDoing so will make some things run faster.\n\n\n\n## Compiling dlib Python API\n\nBefore you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nor type\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS\n```\n\nif you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some things run faster.  Note that you need to have boost-python installed to compile the Python API.\n\n\n\n## Running the unit test suite\n\nType the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:\n\n```bash\ncd dlib/test\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build . --config Release\n./dtest --runall\n```\n\nNote that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called `Release`. If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.\n\nThis library is licensed under the Boost Software License, which can be found in [dlib/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt).  The long and short of the license is that you can use dlib however you like, even in closed source commercial software.\n\n## dlib sponsors\n\nThis research is based in part upon work supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) under contract number 2014-14071600010.
