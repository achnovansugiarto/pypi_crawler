    "description": "# dlib C++ library [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib)\n\nDlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.\n\n\n\n## Compiling dlib C++ example programs\n\nGo into the examples folder and type:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; cmake --build .\n```\n\nThat will build all the examples.\nIf you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .\n```\n\nDoing so will make some things run faster.\n\nFinally, Visual Studio users should usually do everything in 64bit mode.  By default Visual Studio is 32bit, both in its outputs and its own execution, so you have to explicitly tell it to use 64bits.  Since it's not the 1990s anymore you probably want to use 64bits.  Do that with a cmake invocation like this:\n```bash\ncmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\" -T host=x64 \n```\n\n## Compiling your own C++ programs that use dlib\n\nThe examples folder has a [CMake tutorial](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/examples/CMakeLists.txt) that tells you what to do.  There are also additional instructions on the [dlib web site](http://dlib.net/compile.html).\n\n## Compiling dlib Python API\n\nBefore you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nor type\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS\n```\n\nif you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some things run faster.  \n\n\n\n## Running the unit test suite\n\nType the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:\n\n```bash\ncd dlib/test\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build . --config Release\n./dtest --runall\n```\n\nNote that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called `Release`. If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.\n\nThis library is licensed under the Boost Software License, which can be found in [dlib/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt).  The long and short of the license is that you can use dlib however you like, even in closed source commercial software.\n\n## dlib sponsors\n\nThis research is based in part upon work supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) under contract number 2014-14071600010.
