    "description": "dlib C++ library\n\nDlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools\nfor creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems.  See\nhttp://dlib.net for the main project documentation and API reference.\n\n\n\nCOMPILING DLIB C++ EXAMPLE PROGRAMS\n   Go into the examples folder and type:\n       mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; cmake --build .\n   That will build all the examples.  If you have a CPU that supports AVX\n   instructions then turn them on like this:\n       mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .\n   Doing so will make some things run faster.\n\nCOMPILING DLIB Python API\n   Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:\n       python setup.py install\n   or type\n       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS\n   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some\n   things run faster.  \n\nRUNNING THE UNIT TEST SUITE\n   Type the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:\n       cd dlib/test\n       mkdir build\n       cd build\n       cmake ..\n       cmake --build . --config Release\n       ./dtest --runall\n\n   Note that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a\n   subfolder called Release.  If that's the case then you have to go to that\n   folder before running the test.\n\nThis library is licensed under the Boost Software License, which can be found\nin dlib/LICENSE.txt.  The long and short of the license is that you can use\ndlib however you like, even in closed source commercial software.\n\nDlib Sponsors:\n  This research is based in part upon work supported by the Office of the\n  Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research\n  Projects Activity (IARPA) under contract number 2014-14071600010.
