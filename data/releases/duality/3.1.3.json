Developing such a complex module isn't easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep duality free is more than welcome.\n\n**Who stands behind duality?**\n\nThe module itself, it's maintenance, updates and stability, logo, videos, promotional materials and everything associated with duality are done by **David Kundih** from **Croatia**.\n\n**See also:**\n\n**David Kundih GitHub**\nhttps://github.com/dkundih\n\n**David Kundih PyPi**\nhttps://pypi.org/user/dkundih\n\n**David Kundih ResearchGate**\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Kundih\n\nCHANGELOG \n==========\n\n**as alunari**\n\n0.0.1 (16/08/2021)\n- initial release.\n\n0.0.2 (16/08/2021)\n- reupload for functionality.\n\n0.0.3 (16/08/2021)\n- README update.\n- LICENSE update.\n- stability downgrade to 4 - Beta in order to provide more testing and feedback.\n\n0.0.4 (17/08/2021)\n- minor README update.\n- functionality confirmed in testing environment (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, JupyterLab, Google Colab).\n\n0.0.5 (23/08/2021)\n-minor README update with Documentation link changed.\n\n1.0.0 (28/08/2021)\n- first stable release.\n- major functionality changes.\n- reworked 2 functions (.stats is now .get_stats, .risk is now .get_risk).\n- added 1 new function (.get_change).\n- .documentation updated.\n- .montecarlo.functions updated.\n- developement status is now 5 - Production/Stable.\n\n1.0.1 (28/08/2021)\n- small repository update.\n\n1.0.2 (28/08/2021)\n- LICENSE website change.\n- updated information in the functions.\n\n1.1.0 (30/08/2021)\n- README update.\n- alunariTools class created to distinguish logistics tools and functions from original montecarlo class.\n- created a counter of iterations to track live progress.\n\n1.1.1 (31/08/2021)\n- now requires alunariTools in order to provide less confusing code, done outside of the original function.\n\n1.1.2 (09/09/2021)\n- confirmed functionality in Sublime Text.\n- added __name__ == '__main__' info.\n- minor README update.\n\n1.1.3 (10/09/2021)\n- redefined documentation.\n\n1.1.4 (13/09/2021)\n- improved user experience and stability.\n\n1.1.5 (13/09/2021)\n- typo corrections.\n\n1.1.6 (19/09/2021)\n- adjustments to montecarlo.execute() following the dependency changes of alunariTools package.\n- stability and functionality confirmed in repl.it environment.\n\n1.1.7 (19/09/2021)\n- dependencies bug fix.\n\n1.1.8 (19/09/2021)\n- upload bug fix.\n\n1.1.9+ (22/09/2021)\n- merge test.\n\n1.2.0 (22/09/2021)\n- alunari and alunariTools are now merged into alunari.
