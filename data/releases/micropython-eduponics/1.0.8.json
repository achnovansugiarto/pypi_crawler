Once the ESP32 is connected to the Wifi, run the following commands:\n\n```python\nimport upip\nupip.install(\"micropython-eduponics\")\n```\n\nThis will install the latest version of micropython-eduponics package through upip.\n\nExamples are available in the examples/ directory.\n\n## Using firmwares\n\nAlternatively, you can burn a ready made firmware which located under the repository firmwares directory\ncurrently 2 firmware available:\n\n1. 4M-eduponics-micropython.bin - firmware includes micropython-eduponics library pre-installed (without the MQTT client).\n2. 4M-eduponics-MQTT.bin - firmware includes the MQTT library and everything you need to get started with the Eduponics mobile app.\n\nTo flash the firmware, run the following command using esptool.py\n```\nesptool.py --baud 115200 --port <port_name> write_flash 0x0 <firmware_name>.bin\n```\nWhere <firmware_name> is the file name (the bin file you want to flash) and <port_name> is the port name to flash through.\n\nCurrent firmware version: MicroPython v1.13 on 2020-09-02; ESP32 module with ESP32\n\n## Changing MQTT broker\n\nIn order to change the MQTT broker, change the umqttsimple.py file inside the [/Eduponics/](/Eduponics/umqttsimple.py) directory\nMake sure to properly mark whenever you use SSL or not.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Adafruit Industries,\n              2016 Radomir Dopieralski (@deshipu),\n              2016 Paul Cunnane 2016,\n              2016 Peter Dahlebrg,\n              2017 Robert Hammelrath (@robert-hh),\n              2019 Mike Causer (@mcauser),\n              2021 STEMinds (@STEMinds),\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
