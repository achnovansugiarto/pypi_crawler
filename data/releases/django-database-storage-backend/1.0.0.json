    "description": "# django-database-storage-backend\n\nA Django 1.10+/2.x storages backend backed by your existing database.\n\nThis module provides an app named `dbstorage`. The app contains a single model `StoredFile` which is where files stored with the storage backend are put. The app also provides `DatabaseStorage` which you can set on your file fields.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall libmagic, e.g.:\n\n\tbrew install libmagic\n\nInstall this package:\n\n\tpip django-database-storage-backend\n\nPut `'dbstorage'` in your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`.\n\nAdd to your `settings.py`:\n\n\tDEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'dbstorage.storage.DatabaseStorage'\n\nAdd to your `urls.py` URLconf:\n\n\turl(r'^user-media/', include('dbstorage.urls')),\n\n`user-media/` determines the URL path where media files are accessed from. You can set this to anything.\n\nAdd a File or ImageFile field to your model:\n\n\timage = models.ImageField(upload_to='some-root')\n\nFiles saved into this field will be stored in the database and available at the URL path `/user-media/some-root/{HASH}.{EXT}`. `HASH` is the SHA-1 hash of the file content. The file extension is replaced with a normalized file extension by auto-detecting the file type so that no file name information besides the file's type is leaked. This also prevents unauthorized users from randomly guessing the URLs to uploaded files (although SHA-1 is generally deprecated for security purposes in favor of SHA-256 --- so don't use this as your only form of authorization logic if it matters).\n\nThe `upload_to` value cannot be more than 200 characters as the maximum full path length is 255 characters.\n\n## Features\n\n* Easily configure a media storage backend that just uses your existing database for storing and serving your media files.\n* Filenames don't leak the name of the file that it was uploaded from and are based on a hash of the file's content to prevent unauthorized users from guessing file URLs.\n* Secure headers are set to prevent untrusted content from being a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n* The backend supports the `delete`, `exists`, `listdir`, `size`, `url`, `created_time`, and `modified_time` functions.\n* Stored files appear in the Django admin.\n\n## Dynamic image resizing\n\nWhen storing images, the view method can automatically resize an image to one of a few pre-defined sizes. To use this feature, you must install `pillow`. Then add `?width=` plus `xs` (768px), `sm` (1024 px), `md` (1100px), or `lg` (1400px) to the URL when accessing the image. The image returned in the response will have this size as a maximum dimension.\n\nFor Project Maintainers\n-----------------------\n\nTo publish a universal wheel to pypi::\n\n        pip3 install twine\n        rm -rf dist\n        python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --universal\n        twine upload dist/*\n        git tag v1.0.XXX\n        git push --tags\n\n\n",
