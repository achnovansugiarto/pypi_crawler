    "description": "# MJOLNIR-GUI\nThis is a graphical interface for the MJOLNIR: https://github.com/MJOLNIRPackage/MJOLNIR/, which deals with multiplexing inelastic neutron spectrometers. MJOLNIRGui is meant to introduce the scripting software in a user-friendly way and to give access to data-overview methods either during an experiment or when inspecting data files. Further information can be found at https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/camea/data-treatment.\n\n## Citing this package\nIf you use this software for data treatment, please do cite it using its doi and the article found at https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/camea/data-treatment.\n\n\n# Install\n\nThere are in total four ways of installing this interface to MJOLNIR\n\n## Using installers\n\nInstallers for the app is currently supported on Windows and Ubuntu. For both, installation files are available at https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/camea/data-treatment. To install, double click the .exe file in windows, or run the .deb file through the system package manager on Ubuntu.\n\n\n## Anaconda and Pip\n\nThe app can be install in an Anaconda environment on all platforms. In order to do this, first the anaconda environment is to be set up\n\n```bash\n    conda create --name MJOLNIRGui python=3.6 geos numpy scipy shapely\n```\n\nFor windows, it is important that the geos and shapely modules are installed through conda instead of pip. Next, the app is installed by\n\n```bash\n    conda activate MJOLNIRGui\n    pip install MJOLNIRGui\n```\n\nThis installs the needed packages and creates a command line script to run the app. To run, be sure to be in the right environment and call\n\n```bash\n    MJOLNIRGui\n```\n\n## Through git\n\nAs an alternative to the two above methods, it is possible to clone the git repository og MJOLNIRGui and run it locally. This is done by creating a folder in which to clone and invoke the clone command\n\n```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/MJOLNIRPackage/MJOLNIR-GUI.git\n    cd MJOLNIR-GUI\n```\n\nAs was the case for the anaconda and pip method, on Windows the geos and shapely modules need to be installed through anaconda. Further needed packages are fbs PyQt5 PyInstaller==3.4 setuptools<45.0.0, MJOLNIR. With all of these installed navigate to the root directory of the git repository (containing setup.py, src, ...) and call\n\n```bash\n    fbs run\n```\n\n## Ubunto through the apt-get\n\nYou can also add the MJOLNIRGui to be automatically update through the software updater. This is done by\n\n```bash\n    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\n    wget -qO - https://fbs.sh/MJOLNIRPackage/MJOLNIRGui/public-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n    echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://fbs.sh/MJOLNIRPackage/MJOLNIRGui/deb stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mjolnirgui.list\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install mjolnirgui\n```\n\nIf you already have installed the app, a forced  update can be triggered via:\n\n```bash\n    sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mjolnirgui.list\" -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup=\"0\"\n    sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade mjolnirgui\n```\n\nLastly, your can also install without automatic updates by downloading:\n\nhttps://fbs.sh/MJOLNIRPackage/MJOLNIRGui/MJOLNIRGui.deb\n\n\n\n",
