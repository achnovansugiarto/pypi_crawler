(Default: stdin).\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help    show this help message and exit\n  -r [ [ ...]]  Reference .fasta file(s). Format name=path_to_ref.\n  -c [ [ ...]]  Expected counts CSV(s). Format name=path_to_counts. Expected columns: reference,expected_count.\n  -o            Outputs a sam file from the parsed alignments. Use - for piping out. (Default: None).\n  -f            Sets the format(s) in which to output results. [Choices: csv, json, all] (Default: csv).\n  -s  [ ...]    Split by these criteria, comma separated. [Choices: group,run_id,barcode,read_group,reference] (Default: group,run_id,barcode).\n  -n            Prefix of the output files, if there are any.\n```\n\nAn example invocation is as follows:\n\n```\nmapula count <path_to_sam_or_bam> -r <name>=<path_to_a_reference_fasta>\n```\n\nIn the above example, name should be a short-hand nickname for the group of reference sequences in your fasta. E.g. `host`. You may provide multiple values for `-r`.\n\nYou may also split the alignments by different criteria using `-s`, e.g. `-s read_group reference` to\ngroup the alignments into rows based on their read_group and aligned reference.\n\n---\n\nHelp\n----\n\n**Licence and Copyright**\n\nÂ© 2021- Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.\n\n`mapula` is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.\n\n**Research Release**\n\nResearch releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early\naccess to features or stimulate Community development of tools.
