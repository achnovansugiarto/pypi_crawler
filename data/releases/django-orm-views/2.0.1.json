    "description": "# django_orm_views\n\nThe package for managing database views using django, without the migrations.\nIt can be used for generating database views and reading from them using django orm system.\n\n## What does this support?\n* This package adds support to Django for **writing** Postgres views using:\n  * Raw SQL\n  * Django Querysets\n\nThey look something like this:\n\n```python\nclass MySQLView(PostgresViewFromSQL):\n    sql = \"\"\"\n       SELECT col_a, col_b FROM table_1;\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```python\nclass MyQuerysetView(PostgresViewFromQueryset):\n    @classmethod\n    def get_queryset(cls):\n        return (\n            Table1\n            .objects\n            .values('col_a', 'col_b')\n        )\n```\n\n* The package allows reading from a view using django ORM. For a view to be readable, it has to be inherited from \n one of the readable view abstractions - `ReadableViewFromQueryset` or `ReadableViewFromSQL`. It would look like this:\n```python\n\nclass MyReadableView(ReadableViewFromQueryset):\n    @classmethod\n    def get_queryset(cls):\n        return (\n            Table1\n            .objects\n            .values('col_a', 'col_b')\n        )\n    \nresult = MyReadableView.objects.all()\nresult = MyReadableView.objects.filter(name=\"test\")\nresult = MyReadableView.objects.get(id=1)\n```\nThe **name** for the view in the database is generated automatically in the base class - `BasePostgresView`.\nIt's not possible at the moment to define a custom name in the database for a readable view. Though it's possible if the\nview is not readable (not inherited from the readable view abstraction).\n\nSince a readable view is basically a not managed django model, you might want to\nset some custom meta data for it by defining a Meta class inside the readable view (\nFor example changing the data source - `db_table`).\n\n**! Note** that defining a custom Meta class is not allowed in the current version of \nthe package and will lead to an error!\n\nSee some more examples in the tests [here](https://github.com/iwoca/django-orm-views/blob/main/tests/test_project/test_app/postgres_views.py)\n\n\nThis also supports the construction of materialised views via `PostgresMaterialisedViewMixin`. Note that the function `refresh_materialized_view` will\nneed to be managed by the user in order to keep these up to date where required.\n   \n\n## What does this not support?\n\n* Any database engines aside from Postgres (unless syntax happens to be the same!)\n* Defining custom name for a readable view in the database. Although it's \npossible for a view that is not readable.\n* Defining custom Meta class in a readable view as it can be done for a django model\nto define additional settings E.g. `db_table`\n## When should I use this?\n\nOur use-case is for a database which is managed by Django\nin which we would like to provide an analytics-friendly\nrepresentation of some of our data.  This involves giving\nanalytics direct access to our database (whilst using a\npermissions framework), but using views to expose the data\nin a more simple way, as well as obscuring data which\nwe consider personally identifiable/sensitive.\n\nThere are other frameworks existing which do similar things,\nusually including reads via the ORM.  We found that these\npackages all generate migrations (despite being unmanaged)\nand we wanted to remove this from the django migrations process\naltogether - there seemed to be no value add by including\nmigrations and they would just muddy our migration states.\n\n## Cool! But how do I use this?\n\n* `pip install django-orm-views`\n* Add `'django_orm_views'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`\n* Create a `postgres_views.py` (file or package) inside any app\n* Add a `PostgresViewFromQueryset` or `PostgresViewFromSQL` \nto your `postgres_views.py` (as above)\n* run `./manage.py sync_views`\n\nA `postgres_views.py` file might look something like the following:\n\n```python\nclass ComplexViewFromQueryset(PostgresViewFromQueryset):\n\n    prefix = 'test'  # This is optional, but allows you to prefix the table names for views\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def get_queryset(cls):  # Return a `.values` with the query you desire\n        return (\n            TestModelWithForeignKey\n            .objects\n            .all()\n            .annotate(\n                double_integer_col=F('foreign_key__integer_col') * 2\n            )\n            .values(\n                'id',\n                'foreign_key__id',\n                'foreign_key__integer_col',\n                'foreign_key__character_col',\n                'foreign_key__date_col',\n                'foreign_key__datetime_col',\n                'double_integer_col',\n            )\n        )\n```\n\nWhen we run the `./manage.py sync_views`, we'll create a view called `test_complexviewfromqueryset` under\nthe `views` schema.\n\nNote, you can put `./manage.py sync_views` into your CI/CD.  It works by:\n* Opening a transaction\n* Dropping the views schema\n* Recreating the views schema\n* Recreating all views under that schema\n* Committing the transaction\n\n## What's still to come?\n\n* Support for more database engines.  This currently only supports Postgres, \nbut should be a reasonably light shift to support other database engines.\n* Making the package more configurable using settings.\n* Consideration of 0 downtime deployments with views.\n  * Note, this can still be achieved with the current implementation,\n  but a bad migration (with a view depending) could\n  cascade a view and create downtime.  Ideally migrations + \n  view creation should happen in a single transaction.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork the package and propose changes.  The repo comes with a test django project which\ncan be used to effectively test changes.  It also demonstrates the functionality pretty well.\n",
