    "description": "Django Feed Me\n==============\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dstegelman/django-feedme.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dstegelman/django-feedme)\n[![Pypi Version](https://pypip.in/v/django-feedme/badge.png)](https://crate.io/packages/django-feedme/)\n\n\n\nDjango Feed Me is a replacement for Google Reader.  It keeps track of your feeds, fetches the RSS feeds\nand parses them in an easy to read interface.  This is currently in development.  The app works as POC using the Django\nAdmin.  A separate interface for adding feeds is coming down in the pipeline.\n\n![image](http://cl.ly/image/0j2z0y0K1e2e/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-27%20at%209.54.10%20AM.png)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install FeedMe simply:\n\n    pip install django-feedme\n\nAdd ``feedme`` to your installed apps.  Add route a url to ``feedme.urls``\n\nMake sure to syncdb or migrate the app:\n\n    python manage.py syncdb\n    python manage.py migrate\n\n\nIf you want to use Celery for fetching (Recommended) then add:\n\n    FEED_UPDATE_CELERY = True\n\nto your settings file.  Make sure you've installed and configured Celery properly.  The syntax used should be good\nfor both Celery 2 and 3.\n\nThis app bundles static and works out of the box with django static files.  If you aren't collecting static\nyou'll need to copy the static directory to where ever you serve static from.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nAs of FeedMe 1.0 feedme requires Django 1.5 and above.\n\nFeedme also requires the use of the django-bootstrap-static library for some static files.  It is bundled in setup.py so by installing this package\nit should already be downloaded to your machine.  In order to have the bootstrap files picked up by your static files hanlder, you'll need to add\n```bootstrap``` to installed apps.  This will alow Django's static files to pick up the boostrap files.\n\n\nCelery Beat\n-----------\n\nTo make use of the Celery beat schedule to automatically update feeds at given intervals, open your settings file and\nenter something like the following:\n\n    import datetime\n\n\n    CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {\n        \"feed-updates\": {\n            \"task\": \"update_all_feeds\",\n            \"schedule\": datetime.timedelta(hours=1),\n            },\n        }\n\nMore documentation for Celery can be found at the CeleryProject.\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nPlease place all bug reports in Github Issues.  Pull requests are welcome and encouraged!!\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThis document and more formal documentation at http://django-feedme.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n\nAdditional Planned Features\n---------------------------\n\n* Import feeds from Google Reader\n* Add and manage feeds from the front end (rather than Django Admin)\n* Mark all or some feeds as read/unread\n* Look and Feel updates\n* Tests\n\nQuestions/Comments/Hate Mail?\n-----------------------------\n\nDrop an issue in Github and I'll be sure to find it.\n",
