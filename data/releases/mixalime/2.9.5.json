    "description": "# MixALime: Mixture models for Allelic Imbalance Estimation\n\n**Python 3.10+ as of now is not supported due to the fact that datatable package does not support it either. This will change as soon as datatable is released to 1.1.0.**\n\n**MixALime** is a tool for the identification of allele-specific events in high-throughput sequencing data. It works by modelling counts data as a mixture of two Negative Binomial or Beta Negative Binomial distributions (where the latter is more applicable in case of noisy data at a cost of loss of sensitivity).\n\nThe package is *almost* easy to use and we advise everyone to just jump straight to installing **MixALime** and invoking the help command in a command line:\n\n```\n> pip3 install mixalime\n> mixalime --help\n```\n\nWe believe that the help section of **MixALime** covers its functionality well enough. Furthermore, the package arrives with a small demo dataset included and an easy-to-follow instruction in the abovementioned help section. So do not waste your time looking for how-to-clues or tutorials here, just use `--help`.\n\n*Actually this README.md will probably be more complete and detailed one day than it is now, the README-writing person was just too tired at the moment.*\n\nFor the sake of following the social norms that impose a requirement of README files to be useful, in the next section you'll find the excerpt from `--help` command:\n\n# Demo\nA typical **MixALime** session consists of sequential runs of `create`, `fit`, `test`, `combine` and, finally, `export all`, `plot` commands. For instance, we provide a demo dataset that consists of a bunch of BED-like files with allele counts at SNVs (just for the record, **MixALime** can work with most vcf and  BED-like file formats):\n```\n> mixalime export demo\n```\nA *scorefiles* folder should appear now in a working directory with a plenty of BED-like files.\nFirst, we'd like to parse those files into a **MixALime**-friendly and efficient data structures for further usage, as well as perform some \\\nbasic filtering if necessary:\n```\n> mixalime create myprojectname scorefiles\n```\nThen we fit model parameters to the data with Negative Binomial distribution:\n```\n> mixalime fit myprojectname NB\n```\nNext we obtain raw p-values:\n```\n> mixalime test myprojectname\n```\nUsually we'd want to combine p-values across samples and apply a FDR correction:\n```\n> mixalime combine myprojectname\n```\nFinally, we obtain fancy plots fir diagnostic purposes and easy-to-work with tabular data:\n```\n> mixalime export all myprojectname results_folder\n> mixalime plot myprojectname results_folder\n```\nYou'll find everything of interest in *results_folder*.\n\n\n# Combination of p-values across groups\n\n*Note: a popular synonym for \"combination\" in this context is _aggregation_.*\n\nOne important feature that is not covered by the glorified `--help` in a very obvious fashion is a combination of p-values across separate groups (e.g. one group can be a treatment and the other is a control). The `combine` command with default options combines all the p-values. This can be changed by supplying the `--group` option followed by either a list of filenames that make up that group or a file that contains a list (newline-separated) of those files (the most convenient approach, probably), e.g.:\n```\n> mixalime combine --subname treatment -g vcfs/file1.vcf.gz -g vfcfs/file2.vfc.gz -g vcfs/file3.vcf.gz myproject\n> mixalime combine --subname control -g vcfs/file4.vcf.gz -g vfcfs/file5.vfc.gz -g vcfs/file6.vcf.gz myproject\n```\nor\n```\n> mixalime combine --subname treatment -g group_treatment.tsv combine myproject\n> mixalime combine --subname control -g group_control.tsv combine myproject\n```\nThe `--subname` option is necessary if you wish to avoid different `combine` invocations overriding each other.\n\n\n",
