    "description": "# Python MIP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) Tools\n\nPackage website: **http://python-mip.com**\n\nPython MIP is a collection of Python tools for the modeling and solution\nof Mixed-Integer Linear programs (MIPs). MIP syntax was inspired by\n[Pulp](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp). Just like\n[CyLP](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) it also provides access to\nadvanced solver features like cut generation, lazy constraints, MIPstarts\nand solution Pools. Porting Pulp and Gurobi models should be quite easy.\n\nSome of the main features of MIP are:\n\n* high level modeling: write your MIP models in Python as easily as in\n  high level languages such as\n  [MathProg](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)): \n  operator overloading makes it easy to write linear expressions in Python;\n\n* full featured:\n    - cut generators and lazy constraints: work with strong formulations with a\n    large number of constraints by generating only the required inequalities\n    during the branch and cut search;\n    - solution pool: query the elite set of solutions found during the search;\n    - MIPStart: use a problem dependent heuristic to generate initial feasible\n    solutions for the MIP search.\n\n* fast: the Python MIP package calls directly the native dynamic loadable\n  library of the installed solver using the modern python\n  [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io) module; models\n  are efficiently stored and optimized by the solver and MIP transparently\n  handles all communication with your Python code; it is also compatible\n  with the [Pypy](https://pypy.org/) just in time compiler, meaning that\n  you can have a much better performance, up to 25 times faster for the \n  creation of large MIPs, than the official Gurobi python interface \n  which only runs on CPython;\n\n* multi solver: Python MIP was written to be deeply integrated with the\n  C libraries of the open-source COIN-OR Branch-&-Cut\n  [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) solver and the commercial solver\n  [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/); all details of communicating with \n  different solvers are handled by Python-MIP and you write only one\n  solver independent code;\n\n* written in modern [typed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) Python 3 (requires Python 3.5 or newer).\n\n## Examples\n\nMany Python-MIP examples are documented at https://docs.python-mip.com/en/latest/examples.html \n\nThe code of these examples and additional ones (published in tutorials) can be downloaded at https://github.com/coin-or/python-mip/tree/master/examples\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe full Python-MIP documentation is available at\nhttps://docs.python-mip.com/en/latest/\n\nA PDF version is also available:\nhttps://python-mip.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/\n\n## Mailing list\n\nQuestions, suggestions and development news can be posted at the [Python-MIP\ngoogle group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-mip).\n\n## Build status\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/coin-or/python-mip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coin-or/python-mip)\n\n\n",
