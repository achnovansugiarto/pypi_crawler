    "description": "# Python MIP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) Tools\n\nPython MIP is a collection of Python tools for the modeling and solution\nof Mixed-Integer Linear programs (MIPs). MIP syntax was inspired by\n[Pulp](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp). Just like\n[CyLP](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) it also provides access to\nadvanced solver features like cut generation, MIPstarts and solution\nPools. Porting Pulp and Gurobi models should be quite easy.\n\nSome of the main features of MIP are:\n\n* high level modeling: write your MIP models in Python as easily as in\n  high level languages such as\n  [MathProg](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)): \n  operator overloading makes it easy to write linear expressions in Python;\n\n* full featured:\n    - cut generation: write your cut generator in Python and integrate it\n      into the Branch-and-Cut search;\n    - solution pool: query the elite set of solutions found during the\n      search;\n    - mipstart: use a problem dependent heuristic to generate initial\n      feasible solutions for the MIP search;\n\n* fast: the Python MIP package calls directly the native dynamic loadable\n  library of the installed solver using the modern python\n  [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) module; models\n  are efficiently stored and optimized by the solver and MIP transparently\n  handles all communication with your Python code; it is also compatible\n  with the [Pypy](https://pypy.org/) just in time compiler, meaning that\n  you can have a much better performance than the official Gurobi python\n  interface (which is incompatible with Pypy);\n\n* multi solver: Python MIP was written to be deeply integrated with the\n  C libraries of the open-source COIN-OR Branch-&-Cut\n  [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) solver and the commercial solver\n  [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/); the design is solver independent and\n  more solvers may be supported in the future but right now the priority\n  is to support as much as possible all features of these solvers;\n\n* completely written in modern statically typed Python 3 (requires Python\n  3.5 or newer).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Documentation for Python-MIP is available at:\nhttps://python-mip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nA PDF version is also available:\nhttps://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/python-mip/latest/python-mip.pdf\n\n\n\n\n",
