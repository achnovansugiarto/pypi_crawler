    "description": "Django Schedulermanager\n=======================\n\nCreates two commands ``schedulejob`` and ``unschedulejob`` that allows\nyou to schedule (and unschedule) background jobs.\n\nIf you have a brunch of jobs to start with your backend (e.g, if you\nhave to update your social feed every hour) you can just write the code\nof the job, mark it with the ``schedulable`` decorator and the job will\nbe schedulable with the ``schedulejob`` command.\n\nRight now the library uses ``django-rq`` + ``rq-scheduler``, but the\ndependency on ``django-rq`` is not needed and will be removed soon.\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n1. Install the library using ``pip install django_schedulermanager``\n2. Add ``django_schedulermanager.apps.DjangoSchedulerManagerConfig`` to\n   your INSTALLED\\_APPS\n3. Write your job code in a module named 'jobs' (Remember to insert the\n   app in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list)\n4. Import the ``schedulable`` annotation:\n   ``from django_schedulermanager.decorators import schedulable``\n5. Mark your function with ``schedulable``. You can pass to the\n   decorator the following parameters:\n\n   -  interval: The interval of the function. Required.\n   -  scheduled\\_time: When the function should start the first time.\n      Required. It's a function.\n   -  repeat: Not required, by default None which means 'repeat always'\n   -  id: The ID of the job. It will also be the name of the job that\n      you have to pass when using ``(un)schedulejob``. Not required, by\n      default None which means 'use the name of the function'\n   -  queue: The queue to use. By default 'default'\n\nNow you can schedule and unschedule your jobs using\n``python manage.py schedulejob <id>`` and\n``python manage.py unschedulejob <id>``! Call those in your init script\nand your jobs should schedule (and unschedule) automatically\n\nSee also ``test-project`` directory to see an example, if you want to\ntest the project, clone the repository and run the command\n``make testproject``, it will copy the ``django_schedulermanager``\nfolder (the library code) in the ``test-project`` folder\n\nTODO\n----\n\n-  [ ] Remove dependency on ``django-rq``\n-  [ ] If present, read 'queue' from ``@job`` annotation\n-  [ ] Add ``unschedulejob all`` to unschedule all the jobs\n-  [ ] Add a command to remove all the scheduled jobs that don't have a\n   function in the jobs.py files",
