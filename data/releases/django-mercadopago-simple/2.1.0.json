    "description": "django-mercadopago-simple\n=========================\n\n**django-mercadopago-simple** is a simple django application for interacting with\n`MercadoPago <https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/>`_, aiming to be rather simple,\nand only covers the basic uses cases.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nOur intention is not to cover 100% of the features of the upstream API, but\nrather provide a simple app that allows accepting and tracking payments. This\nshould suffice for simple sites like shopping carts, online sales, etc.\n\nPull requests are always welcome. Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you\nencounter a problem. New features will generally only be added as needed, but\nagain, accepted if you submit a patch.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation should generally be done via pip::\n\n    pip install django-mercadopago-simple\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThe following settings apply to this application::\n\n    # Process notifications as soon as they are received:\n    MERCADOPAGO_ASYNC = False\n    # This is the hostname where your server will receive notifications:\n    # Notifcation URLs will be sent with your preferences prefixing this to\n    # their URLs.\n    MERCADOPAGO_BASE_HOST = 'https://example.com/'\n\nNOTE: Asynchronous notification processing is still WIP.\n\nYou'll also want to link your MercadoPago credentials to this app - maybe just\nyours, maybe multiple accounts.\n\nOnce you've obtained your application ``app id`` and ``secret key`` `here\n<https://applications.mercadopago.com/>`_, you'll want to create an ``Account``\nobject with them. This can be done via the django admin included with this app.\n\nYou should also expose the notifications endpoints like this::\n\n    url(r'^mercadopago/', include('django_mercadopago.urls'), namespace='mp'),\n    # Make sure namespace is 'mp', since we assume it is for notification URL\n    # contruction.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nMercadoPago lets you create preferences, for which you'll later receive\nnotifications (indicating if it was payed, or what happened)::\n\n    self.preference = Preference.objects.create(\n        title='the product name',\n        price=10.0,\n        reference='order-38452',\n        success_url='http://example.com/mp_done',\n        account=account,\n    )\n\nIf your app will only be using a single MercadoPago account, just use::\n\n    account = Account.objects.first()\n\nFinally, you can handle payment notifications in real time using a\n``post_update`` hook::\n\n    @receiver(post_save, sender=MercadoPagoPayment)\n    def process_payment(sender, instance=None, created=False, **kwargs):\n        do_stuff()\n\nBackwards compatibility\n-----------------------\n\nVersion 2.0.0 changes the database schema quite a bit. While older data is\nretained, some missing fields had to be filled. Auto-generated data will have\nnegative key values, and should easily be recognizable.\n\nRegrettably, filling in this data is not possible. However, there is no data\nloss involved.\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nThis software is distributed under the ISC licence. See LICENCE for details.\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Hugo Osvaldo Barrera <hugo@barrera.io>",
