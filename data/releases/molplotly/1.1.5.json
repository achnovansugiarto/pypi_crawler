Also, apparently on windows port numbers below `8700` are used by other processes so for safety processes keep to numbers above that.\n\n## Can I run this in colab?\n\nJupyterDash is supposed to have support for Google Colab but at some point that seems to have broken.. Keep an eye on the raised issue [here](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash/issues/10)!\nUpdate (1st March 2022): The plots seem to be running again but the hoverboxes are not showing so I don't think it has been fully fixed - I will keep an eye on it in the meantime.\n\n## Can I save these plots?\n\nAn issue/feature request for this has already been raised [here](https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly/issues/4).\n\n`moltplotly` works using a Dash app which is non-trivial to export because server side javascript is needed in addition to HTML/CSS styling ([as detailed here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60097577/how-to-export-a-plotly-dashboard-app-into-a-html-standalone-file-to-share-with-t))\n\nUntil I find a way to get around that, the best alternative is to either host the plot on an app/server, exporting the plotly figure without molecules showing :( as detailed in this [page](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/). If you want to use it in a presentation I'd suggest keeping the figure open in a browser and changing windows to it during your talk!\n\n## Warning about memory size\n\nJust adding a warning here that memory usage in a notebook can increase significanly when using plotly (not `molplotly`'s fault!). If you notice your jupyter notebook slowing down, plotly itself is a likely culprit... In that case I'd consider either using plotly with [static image rendering](https://plotly.com/python/renderers/#static-image-renderers), or ... use [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) :P\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- [@wjm41](https://github.com/wjm41) (contributor)\n- [@RokasEl](https://github.com/RokasEl) (contributor)\n\n\n",
