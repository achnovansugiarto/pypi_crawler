The dict must follow a key: function structure where the key must correspond to one of the columns in subset or tooltip. (default {})\n* `color_col` : str, optional\\\n    name of the column in df that is used to color the datapoints in df - necessary when there is discrete conditional coloring (default None)\n* `wrap` : bool, optional\\\n    whether or not to wrap the title text to multiple lines if the length of the text is too long (default True)\n* `wraplen` : int, optional\\\n    the threshold length of the title text before wrapping begins - adjust when changing the width of the hover box (default 20)\n* `width` : int, optional\\\n    the width in pixels of the hover box (default 150)\n* `fontfamily` : str, optional\\\n    the font family used in the hover box (default 'Arial')\n* `fontsize` : int, optional\\\n    the font size used in the hover box - the font of the title line is fontsize+2 (default 12)\n    \n#### Output parameters\nby default a JupyterDash `app` is returned which can be run inline in a jupyter notebook or deployed on a server via `app.run_server()`\n\n* The recommended `height` of the app is `50+(height of the plotly figure)`.\n* For the `port` of the app, make sure you don't pick the same `port` as another `molplotly` plot otherwise the tooltips will clash with each other!\n\n## üíª &nbsp; Can I run this in colab?\nJupyterDash is supposed to have support for Google Colab but at some point that seems to have broken... Keep an eye on the raised issue [here](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash/issues/10)!\n\n## üíæ &nbsp; Can I save these plots?\n`moltplotly` works using a Dash app which is non-trivial to export because server side javascript is needed in addition to HTML/CSS styling ([as detailed here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60097577/how-to-export-a-plotly-dashboard-app-into-a-html-standalone-file-to-share-with-t))\n\nUntil I find a way to get around that, the best alternative is exporting the plotly figure without molecules showing :( as detailed in this [page](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/). If you want to use it in a presentation I'd suggest keeping the figure open in a browser and changing windows to it during your talk!\n\n## üõë &nbsp;Warning about memory size  \nJust adding a warning here that memory usage in a notebook can increase significanly when using plotly (not `molplotly`'s fault!). If you notice your jupyter notebook slowing down, plotly itself is a likely culprit... In that case I'd consider either using plotly with [static image rendering](https://plotly.com/python/renderers/#static-image-renderers), or ... use [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) :P\n\n## Acknowledgements\n* [@wjm41](https://github.com/wjm41) (contributor)\n* [@RokasEl](https://github.com/RokasEl) (contributor)",
