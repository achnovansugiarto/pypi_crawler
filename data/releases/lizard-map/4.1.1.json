    "description": "lizard-map\n==========\n\nLizard-map provides basic map interaction for `Django\n<http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ applications that use a `lizard-ui\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui>`_ user interface.  We designed it at\n`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our geographical\ninformation websites (with water management information).\n\nIt provides:\n\n- Openlayers (map javascript libary) map display and server-side map\n  generation (mapnik's WMS functionality). Background maps are configurable.\n\n- A \"workspace\" interaction model: drag mappable items into a workspace and\n  they'll get displayed.  The workspace is stored in the Django database.\n\n- A \"collage\" attached to every workspace for storing selected info on map\n  items (like graphs).\n\n- An extention mechanism to plug more or less arbitrary map sources into the\n  workspace so that they can be displayed, searched, etc.\n\n\nCore concept: workspaces\n------------------------\n\nA *workspace item* is something that can be displayed on a map.  A *workspace*\nis a collection of workspace items that is actually displayed.\n\nThere are two types of workspaces:\n\n- Edit Workspace: Every session/user gets its own workspace. This\n  workspace can be edited.\n\n- Storage Workspace. TODO: extra info.\n\n\nA workspace item needs to know how to display itself, how to search for items\nwhen you click on the map and more.  To get that to work for arbitrary map\nsources, you need to configure an adapter.  The adapter has a ``layer()``\nmethod for returning a mapnik layer, a ``search()`` method for searching and\nso on.\n\n- You register an adapter as a so-called \"setuptools entrypoint\" under a\n  specfic name.\n\n- When you add a workspace item, you pass in the adapter name and an optional\n  snippet of json to configure the adapter.\n\nThe workspace item keeps track of this adapter and its configuragion and uses\nit to generate maps, for searching, etc.\n\n\nCollages\n--------\n\nA workspace item often results in multiple areas or points.  If you click on\nsuch a point, you normally get a popup with extra information.  If you want to\ncompare a couple of those information \"snippets\", you can place them in your\n*collage*. In the GUI this is called \"Selectie\".\n\nClicking the collage gives a popup with all the collected information popups\nin that single popup.\n\n\nInteraction\n-----------\n\nIncluded is quite some javascript for workspace interaction.  Potential\nworkspace items can be drag/dropped into a workspace to add them.  Workspace\nitems can be reordered.  You can drag them to the trash.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nAlmost all dependencies are listed in our ``setup.py``, so they get pulled in\nautomatically.  Not all of them install as good as eggs, though.  You might be\nbetter off installing them system-wide with your OS's own packaging system.\n\nYou can force buildout to use system-wide installed packages with the\n`osc.recipe.sysegg <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/osc.recipe.sysegg>`_ recipe.\nAn example config::\n\n  [buildout]\n  ...\n  parts =\n      sysegg\n      ...\n\n  [sysegg]\n  recipe = osc.recipe.sysegg\n  force-sysegg = true\n  eggs =\n      PIL\n      matplotlib\n      simplejson\n      pyproj\n\n\nDevelopment installation\n------------------------\n\nThe first time, you'll have to run the \"bootstrap\" script to set up setuptools\nand buildout::\n\n    $> python bootstrap.py\n\nAnd then run buildout to set everything up::\n\n    $> bin/buildout\n\n(On windows it is called ``bin\\buildout.exe``).\n\nYou'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in\n``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.\n\nThe current package is installed as a \"development package\", so\nchanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python\nsetup.py develop``).\n\nIf you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released\nversions), add them as an \"svn external\" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory\nand add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.\n\nTests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\\test.exe``.\n\n\nExternal dependencies\n---------------------\n\nThe dependencies for a full website that uses lizard-map are best expressed as\nubuntu/debian package dependencies: build-essential, python2.6-dev, apache2,\nlibjpeg-dev, python-imaging, python-matplotlib, python-mapnik, python-scipy,\nlibapache2-mod-wsgi, python-gdal, spatialite-bin, python-pysqlite2,\npython-pyproj.\n\n\nUpgrading to Lizard 3\n---------------------\n\nShort summary to convert your app to Lizard 3.\n\n- Replace old template tags workspace with workspace_edit and\n  collage_edit (see below).\n\n- Review urls.py for old lizard_map views. Replace with new ones or\n  remove.\n\n- Migrate\n\n- Upgrade to class-based views, using one of the View classes\n  (i.e. AppView). An excellent description can be found when googling\n  \"class based views reinout\". You can take lizard-map views as\n  examples as well.\n\n\nSite integration\n----------------\n\nThe following steps has to be done in order to use the\nlizard_map/workspace concepts.\n\n- Install lizard-map somewhere. (Add 'lizard-map' in your setup.py:\n  install_requires)\n\n- Add 'lizard_map' to your settings.py: INSTALLED_APPS.\n\n- Add an entry in your urls.py::\n\n    import lizard_map.urls\n\n    (r'^map/', include(lizard_map.urls)),\n\n- Use one of the views, i.e. AppView.\n\n\nExample view::\n\n    from lizard_map.views import AppView\n\n    class MyAppView(AppView):\n        template_name = 'my_app/template.html'\n\n\nExample template::\n\n    {% extends \"lizard_map/wms.html\" %}\n    {% load workspaces %}\n\n    {% block subtitle %} (page name) {% endblock %}\n\n    {% block sidebar %}\n\n    <div id=\"iconbox\" class=\"sidebarbox sidebarbox-stretched iconlist\">\n      <h2>Apps</h2>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"/address/\" class=\"lizard-map-link\">\n              <img src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_ui/app_icons/meetgegevens.png\" />\n              <div>App</div>\n            </a>\n          </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    {% workspace_edit view.workspace_edit %}\n    {% collage_edit view.collage_edit %}\n\n    {% endblock %}\n\n- Add this view to your url.py:\n\n    import my_app.views\n\n    (r'^$', my_app.views.MyAppView.as_view()),\n\n\n- Start testing by running syncdb / migrate.\n\n- Add and configure background maps by loading \"background_maps\" fixture.\n\n- Start dev server.\n\n\nSettings\n--------\n\nSome default date range settings can be set in settings.py. All\nsettings are optional::\n\n    START_YEAR = 2000  # Defaults to today - 7 years\n    END_YEAR = 2010  # Defaults to today + 3 years.\n\n    # Define default period 1..5\n    # From daterange.py:\n    # PERIOD_DAY = 1\n    # PERIOD_TWO_DAYS = 2\n    # PERIOD_WEEK = 3\n    # PERIOD_MONTH = 4\n    # PERIOD_YEAR = 5\n    # PERIOD_OTHER = 6\n\n    DEFAULT_PERIOD = 5  # Defaults to 1\n\n    # If DEFAULT_PERIOD = 6, define these\n    DEFAULT_START_DAYS = -20  # Defaults to -1000\n    DEFAULT_END_DAYS = 1  # Defaults to 10\n\nYou can add google analytics to your site by adding the tracking\ncode::\n\n    GOOGLE_TRACKING_CODE = 'AA-12345678-0'\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- Main coders: Jack Ha and `Reinout van Rees\n  <http://reinout.vanrees.org>`_ (`Nelen & Schuurmans\n  <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_).\n\n- Core workspace interaction concept: Jan-Maarten Verbree and\n  Bastiaan Roos (`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_).\n\n\nChangelog of lizard-map\n=======================\n\n4.1.1 (2012-06-29)\n------------------\n\n- Importing JSONField in fields.py as otherwise the migrations fail.\n\n\n4.1 (2012-06-28)\n----------------\n\n- Requiring newer django-jsonfield version (which works with django's multi-db\n  functionality). Removed our custom JSONField in favour of\n  django-jsonfield's one.\n\n\n4.0 (2012-06-19)\n----------------\n\n- Added flot graph axis label support.\n\n- Some table styling.\n\n- Fix date range popup.\n\n- Readded the option to save a workspace.\n\n- Readded the nothingFoundPopup.\n\n- Support EPSG:3857 alias for google coordinates.\n\n- Added feature to load stored workspace in editable workspace.\n\n- Add moving box on collage-add and multiple select.\n\n- Fix my-collage popups.\n\n- Reinstated multi-select functionality.\n\n\n4.0b6 (2012-06-01)\n------------------\n\n- Add support for bar graphs (Flot).\n\n- Remove an obsolete console.log call.\n\n\n4.0b5 (2012-05-31)\n------------------\n\n- Removed OpenLayers.ImgPath of theme 'Dark'.\n\n- Minor styling fix for workspaces.\n\n- Add the new FlotGraph.\n\n4.0b4 (2012-05-29)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed Javascript not finding href attributes during click events.\n\n\n4.0b3 (2012-05-29)\n------------------\n\n- Collage and workspace are now styled using tables.\n\n\n4.0b1 (2012-05-29)\n------------------\n\n- Added missing dependency lizard_security.\n\n- Fixed popup and popup contents styling.\n\n- Collage and workspace UI working again.\n\n\n4.0a1 (2012-05-18)\n------------------\n\n- Requiring lizard-ui 4.0 alpha: the new twitter bootstrap layout.\n\n- Using compiled css instead of less.\n\n- Removed old HomepageView and renamed the MapIconView.\n\n- Using new twitter-bootstrap layout. Using the MapView class based view is\n  now really mandatory to get everything to work.\n\n- Renamed /media to /static. That's django-staticfile's new standard.\n\n- Timeseries can now be localized in Graph object.\n\n- Fixed syntax error in jquery.workspace.js.\n\n- Adds STATIC_URL to application icons.\n\n- Making the normal AppView the main cbv instead of the temporary MapView name.\n\n\n3.31 (2012-05-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed map click popup to jQuery ui dialog: it is now movable and\n  resizable.\n\n- The maximum number of tabs in popups has been made configurable.\n\n- If an item is removed from the workspace while rendering (for instance because an Exception\n  was raised), the page loads without giving an internal server error caused by trying to\n  create a Legend.\n\n\n3.30 (2012-04-26)\n-----------------\n\n- Added one icon.\n\n\n3.29 (2012-04-25)\n-----------------\n\n- Added two icons.\n\n\n3.28 (2012-04-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Re-enabling hover functionality on saved workspaces.\n\n\n3.27.1 (2012-04-13)\n-------------------\n\n- Also removed references to touch.js and lizard_touch.js from the templates...\n\n\n3.27 (2012-04-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Required lizard-ui 3.14 (new Openlayers).\n\n- Removed touch.js, necessary with the new Openlayers version.\n\n- Uncommented extent() in WorkspaceItemAdapter. It should be there\n  because it is one of the methods that can be overridden by\n  implementing adapters.\n\n3.26 (2012-04-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed collage detail template so that apps can configure it a bit more.\n  Collage items (that are put in groups on the collage page) have properties\n  that control the header shown over the group (data_description), which edit\n  dialog to show for a collage item edit button (collage_detail_edit_action),\n  whether to show the whole Edit block at all (collage_detail_show_edit_block),\n  and whether to show the statistics block (collage_detail_show_statistics_block).\n\n  These functions in turn call functions in their adapters, with an identifier\n  as argument (because one adapter can have items in different groups, with different\n  settings. This way it gets the identifier of the first item in each group):\n\n    def collage_detail_data_description(self, identifier, *args, **kwargs):\n      default 'Grafiek'\n    def collage_detail_edit_action(self, identifier, *args, **kwargs):\n      default 'graph'\n    def collage_detail_show_edit_block(self, identifier, *args, **kwargs):\n      default True\n    def collage_detail_show_statistics_block(self, identifier, *args, **kwargs):\n      default True\n\n  *args and **kwargs are meaningless but present in case the functions' signatures\n  change in the future. These functions can be overridden in your adapter.\n\n\n3.25 (2012-04-04)\n-----------------\n\n- Improved docstrings at a few places (mainly location() in\n  WorkspaceItemAdapter)\n\n- Added method 'adapter_layer_json' to WorkspaceItemAdapter, helpful\n  to generate this bit of json when it's needed.\n\n- Added 'adapter': self to html_default's template context variables.\n  This gives templates access to adapter's methods and attributes,\n  like adapter.adapter_class and adapter.adapter_layer_json.\n\n3.24 (2012-03-05)\n-----------------\n\n- It's now possible to not use a popup_click_handler.\n\n\n3.23 (2012-02-16)\n-----------------\n\n- Added grouping_hint option to the result of adapter.search(), to make it\n  possible for a single workspace layer to open a popup with multiple tabs.\n\n\n3.22 (2012-01-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Translation fixes, added breadcrumb to the workspace storage\n  page. Last fixes before \"Lizard 3.0\" release?\n\n\n3.21 (2012-01-26)\n-----------------\n\n- Make sure graphs never zoom in so far that they show Y-axis values\n  with more than 2 decimals.\n\n\n3.20 (2012-01-26)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed waterstand icon from triangle pointing up to triangle\n  pointing down.\n\n- Changed workspace save/load functionality. Now workspaces can only\n  be saved, which gives them a \"secret slug\" (a string with random\n  characters), and the workspace detail page is opened in a new page.\n  The URL to this page includes the secret slug and can be shared with\n  others. The workspace shown on the page can't be changed. The\n  \"workspace load\" button is gone until we have a nice user interface\n  that can show many saved workspaces, and a way to deal with user\n  privileges.\n\n  This is minimal functionality that will be improved in later\n  versions.\n\n3.19 (2012-01-23)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed Download button because we don't have working background maps\n\n- Added a nice calendar to the period selection dialog\n\n- Fixed bug with opacity slider and WMS layers\n\n- Added some functions for the collage detail page, so that different apps\n  can show different titles and/or hide the Edit button.\n\n3.18 (2012-01-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Breadcrumbs for application screens, first\n  page of applications\n\n- Possibility for apps to add their own breadcrumbs\n\n\n3.17 (2012-01-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug where items on the collage page didn't have access to the\n  request (and therefore not to start- and end dates).\n\n\n3.16 (2012-01-10)\n-----------------\n\n- Fix bug with editing collages.\n\n\n3.15 (2012-01-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Fix bug where X-label of graph wasn't visible.\n\n\n3.14.1 (2012-01-05)\n-------------------\n\n- Nothing changed yet.\n\n\n3.14 (2012-01-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Hack to prevent error when a dictionary key doesn't exist.\n\n\n3.13 (2012-01-04)\n-----------------\n\n- Skip map layers without params in downloaded image. (internal server\n  error fix)\n\n\n3.12.1 (2012-01-02)\n-------------------\n\n- Fix bug: not every adapter has an extent\n\n\n3.12 (2012-01-02)\n-----------------\n\n- The workspace item zoom button is back and works.\n\n- Changed \"jouw\" in some tooltip strings to \"uw\".\n\n3.11 (2011-12-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Added functions in collage_edit and workspace_edit to check whether\n  certain items already exist in them.\n\n- Fixed bug where items could be added to a collage several times.\n\n3.10 (2011-12-21)\n-----------------\n\n- New template tag 'if_in_workspace_edit' that can return a string\n  if a given item's name is present in the workspace.\n\n3.9 (2011-12-21)\n----------------\n\n- Removed some max_lengths in forms.py, because it caused valid forms\n  to fail. There is no reason JSON fields should have a hard limit,\n  and other fields should have the same limit as in the model.\n\n3.8 (2011-12-20)\n----------------\n\n- Added 'transform_point' utility function that can use the site's\n  projection Setting to transform points to a desired projection.\n\n\n3.7 (2011-12-20)\n----------------\n\n- Made it possible to scale y-axis of graphs manually (it used to be\n  possible, except then the y-axis would be recalculated afterwards)\n\n\n3.6 (2011-12-19)\n----------------\n\n- WorkspaceItemAdapter's html_default() can use the\n  extra_render_kwargs kwarg again. Subclasses can use it to send\n  variables to the template and still use the html_default method for\n  most of the work.\n\n- Added a block popup_title to html_default.html so that the title\n  can be changed in extending templates.\n\n\n3.5.2 (2011-11-29)\n------------------\n\n- Removed object-actions block with the non-existing 'help-workspace' url that\n  broke the interface.\n\n\n3.5.1 (2011-11-28)\n------------------\n\n- Restored a small feature that RainApp depends on.\n\n- Fixed test test_mixins.\n\n\n3.5 (2011-11-14)\n----------------\n\n- Added wms_layers function to base Workspace model so that lizard-wms\n  can work.\n\n\n3.4.3 (2011-11-11)\n------------------\n\n- Deleted collage help button because it didn't work.\n\n- Textual changes to satisfy pyflakes/pep8.\n\n\n3.4.2 (2011-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- Nothing changed yet.\n\n\n3.4.1 (2011-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- Minor layout.\n\n\n3.4 (2011-11-07)\n----------------\n\n- Added layout_extra_from_request to AdapterMixin.\n\n- Updated adapter views for image and values: you can now provide start and\n  end dates in the url parameters.\n\n- Added new adapter function identifiers.\n\n- Fixed bug where tipsy tooltips didn't close correctly\n  https://office.nelen-schuurmans.nl/trac/ticket/3378\n  https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy/issues/19\n\n- Added tooltip to the remove icon within the workspace\n\n3.3 (2011-10-31)\n----------------\n\n- Cleaned up admin.py.\n\n- Added experimental rest.js to handle rest apis.\n\n- Improved i18n and tipsy tooltips.\n\n\n3.2 (2011-10-06)\n----------------\n\n- Nothing changed yet.\n\n\n3.1.5 (2011-10-05)\n------------------\n\n- Replaced dialogReplaceTitles with the more generic dialogReplaceIds\n  and replaceItems. After submitting a dialog box you can now change\n  the items you like. Some gui elements will be re-initialized.\n\n- Fixed updating animation slider after changing period.\n\n- Fixed animation slider bug.\n\n- Updated MANIFEST.in to use graft.\n\n\n3.1.4 (2011-10-05)\n------------------\n\n- Added option for restrict_to_month with javascript\n  enabling/disabling field.\n\n- Added view for statistics, javascript loading statistics in collage\n  screen because that could take a while.\n\n- Added reload page + message when period is changed in collage screen.\n\n- Fixed collage item add when name is too long.\n\n- Fixed javascript_hover_handler.\n\n- Updated CollageItemEditorView to work correctly with adapter.image.\n\n- Collage item editor: No week and day.\n\n- Collage item editor: group fields are now filled in for every\n  collage item in the group.\n\n- Cleaned up unused code.\n\n- Moved export csv button to table \"Bewerken\".\n\n- Statistics in collage screen are now below edit options.\n\n- Changed geoserver url to ip address, see #3283.\n\n- And yet another (last) bug in **identifier in\n  html_default. Apparently keys from identifiers are transformed to\n  unicode on the server, while the development environment works just fine.\n\n\n3.1.3 (2011-10-03)\n------------------\n\n- Convert keys of adapter.identifier to str before using it in\n  html_default.\n\n\n3.1.2 (2011-10-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed error in MANIFEST.in. 3.1.1 didn't include any lizard-map/* data.\n\n\n3.1.1 (2011-10-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed CollageEditItem.csv_url function.\n\n- Fixed bug with collage items. The popup crashed as well as the\n  collage screen.\n\n- Moved from company-internal svn to github:\n  https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-map .\n\n\n3.1 (2011-09-30)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed Color/Mapnik Color related bug.\n\n- Added non-blockable spaces to html_default.html to prevent\n  disappearing icons.\n\n- Improved float layout in collage detail: statistics.\n\n- Reload page after changing collage in collage detail screen.\n\n- Fixed problem when adding collage items by coordinates (name too long).\n\n- Fixed (re-) sorting of collage items.\n\n- Fixed dialog box items first time popup in collage screen.\n\n- Removed setUpGraphEditPopup, it was used in the popup code.\n\n- Changed lizard-map client-side error.\n\n- Fixed google maps in wms.\n\n- Added date popup to collage detail view.\n\n- Added download-map button.\n\n- Added y-min and y-max option for collage detail screen.\n\n- Added csv statistics output for collage.\n\n- Added table view to collage edit detail screen.\n\n- Improved layout collage-item editor popup.\n\n- Improved layout collage edit detail screen.\n\n- Improved export csv link in popup: now for every location.\n\n- Moved Grouping_hint check from adapter.location to\n  adapter.location['identifier']. Apparently this was the location of\n  the grouping hint.\n\n- Pylint.\n\n- Added option \"add to selection\" in map popup.\n\n- Removed console.log and alert from js.\n\n- Fixed popup dialog size, it will now always be the default size.\n\n- Fixed \"pan & zoom to default location\". After changes in workspace\n  the button didn't work anymore.\n\n- WMS background maps can now be used as overlays.\n\n\n3.0 (2011-09-28)\n----------------\n\nLizard 3: Make sure you read the readme before upgrading to this version.\n\n- Rebuilt collage screen with grouping.\n\n- Added configchecker.\n\n- Added migration for new models; South introspection rules.\n\n- Integrated search_name in search_coordinates.\n\n- Various functions work on WorkspaceEdits and WorkspaceStorages.\n\n- Added generic dialog javascript code.\n\n- Added generic POST action javascript code.\n\n- Made app_screen class-based, with helper class WorkspaceView.\n\n- Added new workspaces, collages.\n\n- Added PeriodMixin with tests.\n\n- Added all kinds of mixins for workspaces, collages, etc:\n  GoogleTrackingMixin, WorkspaceMixin, WorkspaceEditMixin, MapMixin,\n  CollageMixin, DateRangeMixin.\n\n- Added class based views: AppView,\n  WorkspaceStorageView, HomepageView, CollageDetailView.\n\n- Added class based views for dialogs: ActionDialogView, WorkspaceSaveView,\n  WorkspaceLoadView, DateRangeView, CollageItemEditorView,\n  WorkspaceStorageListView, CollageView, CollageEmptyView,\n  CollageItemEditView, CollagePopupView, WorkspaceEmptyView.\n\n- Adapter stuff: AdapterMixin, ImageMixin, AdapterImageView, AdapterCsvView.\n\n\n2.5 (2011-09-23)\n----------------\n\n- Not mentioning pyproj as a dependency anymore, even though we *do* need\n  it. Somehow the osc.recipe.sysegg buildout recipe doesn't really want to\n  play nice with it.\n\n- When there's an non-existing adapter (=invalid/non-existing entry point\n  name), we now also delete the workspace item instead of raising an\n  error. There just might be an old workspace item laying around in a\n  customer's session and we shouldn't keep the customer stuck in an\n  error 500.\n\n\n2.4 (2011-09-22)\n----------------\n\n- The context processor now first weeds out faulty workspace items before\n  attempting anything else. This prevents an \"error 500\": normally the\n  workspace item gets deleted, but the .is_animatable call still breaks on the\n  just-deleted workspaceitem. Now we first remove the faulty ones beforehand.\n\n\n2.3 (2011-09-20)\n----------------\n\n- Made the automatic invalid-workspaceitem-deletion more robust.\n\n- Removed the youtube popup. Unused at the moment. And the implementation was\n  terribly hardcoded.\n\n- Commented out all the debugging in the symbolmanager\n\n\n2.2 (2011-09-02)\n----------------\n\n- 2.1.13 stated \"please clear your session info when you upgrade to this\n  version as the fix to #3181 stores different information.\" This release\n  fixes that. No session data deletion is needed anymore.\n\n\n2.1.13 (2011-09-01)\n-------------------\n\n- Fixed a problem in the date range selector, namely that the day of the end\n  date with move to the next day when the user selected another month of the\n  end date (#3181).\n\n- Added request to templatetag snippet_group to be able to use request in\n  adapters' html function.\n\n\n2.1.12 (2011-08-30)\n-------------------\n\n- Added try/except around hotshot in profile middleware, because it\n  requires python-profiler.\n\n- Added request to layout_options in popup_collage_json. The request\n  is needed in some adapter.html functions in order to get user\n  datetime/periods.\n\n\n2.1.11 (2011-08-30)\n-------------------\n\n- Fixed progress cursor in popup_click_handler().\n\n- Zoom to closest extent is no longer used for workspace items.\n\n\n2.1.10 (2011-08-24)\n-------------------\n\n- Requiring lizard-ui 3.0 now, which also means Django 1.3. Updated the\n  buildout and the testsettings for that. We're also using the KGS (known good\n  set) now to limit the amount of version pinning.\n\n\n2.1.9 (2011-08-16)\n------------------\n\n- Edited mouse progress on click in map.\n\n\n2.1.8 (2011-08-05)\n------------------\n\n- Added function to list icons names.\n\n\n2.1.7 (2011-08-04)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed background-map wms.

Note: run a\n  migrate after upgrading, the Setting.key field can now be 40\n  characters.\n\n- #3096: fixed blue info button in workspace-acceptables (they appear\n   in lizard-shape).\n\n\n2.1.4 (2011-07-14)\n------------------\n\n- iPad update: the (+) works again as well as some trees on the\n  sidebar. #3003, #3004.\n\n\n2.1.3 (2011-07-12)\n------------------\n\n- Removed draggability of workspace-acceptables.\n\n- Made the adapter.extent function optional. In\n  WorkspaceItem.has_extent we now just detect if the function is at\n  all present.  #3041, #3036.\n\n- Added wms layers to transparency function. #3039.\n\n- Updated googlemaps_api_keys in fixture: the new key is for\n  lizardsystem.nl and all its subdomains.\n\n- Updated workspace_item_empty: When emptying workspace, the\n  snippet-groups will also be deleted. #3031.\n\n- Added try/except around search_coordinates and search_name for\n  #3033.\n\n\n2.1.2 (2011-06-30)\n------------------\n\n- Adapter.legend: removed \"force_legend_below\" behaviour when width <\n  500. TODO: fix force_legend_below or remove.\n\n- Changed adapter.legend: self.axes.legend instead of\n  self.figure.legend. Everything seems ok.\n\n\n2.1.1 (2011-06-30)\n------------------\n\n- Added google_tracking_code from settings to context_processor, if\n  available.\n\n- Added try/except in WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup.values_table (used\n  in \"show tables\" of collage view), because some adapters don't\n  implement the adapter.values function.\n\n\n2.1 (2011-06-29)\n----------------\n\n- Temporary disable sorting in workspace when a new workspace-item is\n  being added. Solves #2961.\n\n\n2.0.1 (2011-06-22)\n------------------\n\n- Really fixed the non-closed span element.\n\n\n2.0 (2011-06-22)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed a non-closed 'span' element that broke the layout in IE.\n\n\n1.90 (2011-06-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Changed empty workspace text.\n\n\n1.89 (2011-06-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Raising workspaceitemerror when the json we get isn't decodable. More\n  robust code this way.\n\n\n1.88 (2011-06-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Made popups more consistent (shadow color and size).\n\n- Added 'continue to site' link in introductory video popup.\n\n- Showing reload link in the statistics part that is shown when the date range\n  has been changed.\n\n- Adding extra safety measure so lizard-map doesn't crash on faulty\n  shapefiles.\n\n- Fixed collage graph editing: made a check more robust for missing parameters.\n\n\n1.87 (2011-06-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Re-enabled custom y tick locator amount selection.\n\n- Showing the table now looks at the table belonging to the button by means of\n  a wrapper div, which is more reliable.\n\n- Fixed the problem that a hidden popup would remain populated and re-evaluated\n  (ticket 2892).\n\n\n1.86 (2011-06-16)\n-----------------\n\n- Added bare try/except around wms workspace layer looping to prevent\n  the function to crash.\n\n- Added transparency_slider to context variables. From now on the\n  transparency_slider is enabled by default.\n\n- Added optional popup_video_url parameter to the ``homepage()`` view.  This\n  video url, when used, should point to the embed urls of YouTube videos.\n  Currently the sizes are hardcoded, so this is work-in-progress.\n  The video is shown once per day, max.\n\n- Modified graph: less yticks, bigger ylabel, dutch monthnames,\n  yearlabel is now at first tick of year.\n\n\n1.85 (2011-06-10)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed tab setup in graph popup: no more unneeded reloading of the html. Also\n  the graphs aren't reloaded more often than necessary.\n\n- Added force_legend_below parameter to ``legend()`` to force the legend to be\n  placed below the graph.\n\n- Added function to create a image from reguest and response to save\n  it as .png on client side (views.py, urls.py, lizard_wms.js)\n\n- Added declaration to OpenLayers' ImgPath to use our own dark theme location.\n\n- Implemented tipsy in some places.\n\n- Worked on appearance of graph-popup.\n\n\n1.84 (2011-06-07)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed javascript bug that prevented IE from displaying background maps.\n\n- Changed start_extent in background_maps fixture to match 1.83 changes.\n\n\n1.83 (2011-06-07)\n-----------------\n\n- Solved intermittent problem with the zooming level. See #2656, #2762, and\n  #2794.\n\n\n1.82 (2011-06-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Added spinner (\"waiting\") icon for clicking on a workspace item, clicking on\n  the plus sign, deleting a workspace item or deleting a collage item.\n\n\n1.81 (2011-06-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Workspace items and snippets take up a fixed one-line height now. The\n  overflow is hidden. This makes the interface more predictable.\n\n\n1.80 (2011-06-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Added default \"javascript_click_handler\" (namely ``popup_click_handler``) to\n  the context via the lizard_map context processor.\n\n- By default, a hover_click_handler isn't added anymore unless you specify one\n  yourself in the context. Most sites don't need/want it.\n\n- Fixed overly-aggressive reloading of map layers. This improves the performance.\n\n- Added checkboxes and functionality to collage-items (snippets).\n\n\n1.79 (2011-05-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Use gray background color for map: loading of tiles is less noticable\n\n- Added possibility for profiling middleware according to\n  http://www.no-ack.org/2010/12/yet-another-profiling-middleware-for.html\n\n- Added debug toolbar.\n\n- Upped django to 1.2.3.\n\n\n1.78 (2011-05-18)\n-----------------\n\n- Various UI fixes and IE7 glitches.\n\n- Fixed 'add to collage' option in workspace view when viewing others'\n  workspaces.

At periods > 10 year, not every\n  year gets a label anymore.\n\n- Fixed default period. It now takes the period depending on\n  DEFAULT_PERIOD.\n\n\n1.72 (2011-04-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Added tag_date_trigger.\n\n\n1.71 (2011-04-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Added templatetag for date_trigger.\n\n- Replaced action-icon 'calendar' and date_popup block to block\n  above-content in lizardgis.html and wms.html.\n\n- Changed function updateDateSelectOrInput() in lizard_map.js to\n  update title of action-icon 'calendar'\n\n- Deleted action-icon 'calendar' and date_popup block from\n  tag_workspace.html\n\n- Fixed bug with updating snippet-list when pressing trashcan.\n\n- Implemented new date popup (day, 2 days, week, ...). It now stores\n  relative datetimes in the session. It submits and updates on\n  changes. Added tests for daterange.\n\n- Modified adapter.py so that graphs always have a top margin\n\n- Fixed timeout on nothingFoundPopup (#2585).\n\n- Fixed nothingFoundPopup on collage class (#2557).\n\n- Removed map parameter from show_popup function.\n\n\n1.70 (2011-04-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Rewritten loop to remove all openlayers layers to prevent error in\n  newest openlayers.\n\n- Fixed OpenLayers location to /static_media/openlayers/.\n\n\n1.69 (2011-04-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed #2582: fixed load default map location.\n\n\n1.68 (2011-04-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed jslint warning.\n\n\n1.67 (2011-04-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Added custom OpenLayers._getScriptLocation.\n\n- Changed x-axis layout for graphs to have more ticks with no overlapping\n\n- Added method to set_ylim_margin() to adapter.Graph.\n\n- Jslint jquery.workspace.js.\n\n- Fixed blank nothingFoundPopup.\n\n- Added WorkspaceItemError class.\n\n\n1.66 (2011-04-14)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed collage popup.\n\n\n1.65 (2011-04-14)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed header from standard popup (looks better).\n\n- Added feature to click on workspaces of other users than yourself.\n\n- Improved zoom to layer (it was zoomed in too much).\n\n- Added default settings to MapSettings, improved code a bit.\n\n- Renamed fixture lizard_map to background_maps.\n\n- Added progress animation (zandloper) on delete workspece item(s) by\n  click on the trash icon and by dragging/draopping the item into\n  trash.\n\n\n1.64 (2011-04-12)\n-----------------\n\n- Added migration for BackgroundMap and Setting models.\n\n- Changed \"zoom to box\" instead of \"pan to center\" when clicking\n  workspace-acceptable or workspace-item magnifying glass.\n\n- Added BackgroundMap and Setting models. Model BackgroundMap used to\n  store the configuration of single background maps and if the map is\n  the default one.

In your\n  view you do not need to add these variables anymore. You can still\n  provide your own workspaces or date_range_form by adding them in\n  your view.\n\n- Added context_processors.processor. This replaces the custom\n  templatetags.map. See README for usage (TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS).\n\n- Added var html in lizard_map.js (Jslint).\n\n\n1.59 (2011-03-10)\n-----------------\n\n- (+) shows up when hovering above a workspace-acceptable.

It appears after\n  clicking an item.\n\n- Changed arrow to magnifier. Only shows magnifier if\n  WorkspaceItem.has_extent is True.\n\n- Added tests for google_to_srs and srs_to_google.\n\n- Added WorkspaceItem.has_extent.\n\n- Added transformation of projection on extent function.\n\n\n1.57 (2011-03-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Added tests for MapSettings.\n\n- Added srid property to MapSettings.\n\n\n1.56 (2011-02-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed update workspace bug.\n\n\n1.55 (2011-02-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Added coordinates.MapSettings. It makes life easier when reading\n  from your django setting MAP_SETTINGS.\n\n- Added support for client-side wms adapter. This will add, remove,\n  reload wms layers client-side without reloading the page.\n\n\n1.54 (2011-02-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Removed example_homepage.html, updated app_screen.html and\n  views.homepage.\n\n\n1.53 (2011-02-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Added app_screen template for pages with apps, workspace and map.\n\n\n1.52 (2011-02-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Switched off mandatory authentication for the experimental API.\n\n\n1.51 (2011-02-16)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug in date range handling: the default start/end dates would\n  be calculated JUST ONCE at system startup.  So the \"2 weeks before\n  today\" would really be \"2 weeks before the date apache restarted\".\n  Fixed it by adding two methods that do the proper thing.\n\n\n1.50 (2011-02-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Added support for ApplicationScreens.\n\n- Added fool proof checking on Color object.\n\n\n1.44 (2011-02-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Added **experimental** django-piston REST api.\n\n\n1.43 (2011-02-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed breadcrumbs bug.\n\n\n1.42 (2011-02-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug with breadcrumbs on homepage.\n\n- Fixed bug with daterange template.\n\n- Added default view for apps homepage, including example homepage.\n\n- Added function html to color object.\n\n- Added option ncol to Graph legend.\n\n- Added extra logging for missing TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS.\n\n- Started sphinx documentation setup.\n\n\n1.41 (2011-01-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Added option \"data-popup-login\" to \"lizard-map-link\", which pops up\n  a login screen before following the link.\n\n\n1.40 (2011-01-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Improved css for workspace acceptable. Minor change, but it looks\n  good.\n\n\n1.39 (2011-01-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Improved css for workspace items.\n\n- Added add_datasource_point to compensate for Mapnik bug #402.\n\n- Added add-to-workspace button next to workspace acceptables.\n\n- Added pan-to function to workspace items.\n\n- Added panning when selecting a workspace-acceptable.\n\n- Changed default workspace name from \"Workspace\" to \"My Workspace\".\n\n- Added workspace.extent function and corresponding url.\n\n\n1.38 (2011-01-11)\n-----------------\n\n- Google Maps API key in wms.html is now a variable.\n\n\n1.37 (2011-01-11)\n-----------------\n\n- Added debugging info in custom templatetag map.\n\n- Changed 'load map location' to 'load default map location'.\n\n- Removed 'save map location'.\n\n- The map automatically saves its position when leaving the page.\n\n\n1.36 (2011-01-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Added function detect_prj in coordinates.\n\n\n1.35 (2011-01-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix ZeroDivisionError in statistics.\n\n\n1.34 (2011-01-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix http_user_agent in test client.\n\n\n1.33 (2011-01-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Make clicking less sensitive for iPad.\n\n- Introduced analyze_http_user_agent in utility.py.\n\n\n1.32 (2011-01-04)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix touch.js: now we can pan again.\n\n\n1.31 (2011-01-04)\n-----------------\n\n- Improved touch.js: now we pan instantly. If we pan very little, it\n  will now click.\n\n\n1.30 (2011-01-04)\n-----------------\n\n- Added browser detection as custom template tag.\n\n- Added location awareness.\n\n- Added touch gestures for map (iPad, iPhone, android support).\n\n- Added initial South migration.\n\n\n1.29 (2010-12-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed load/save map location after altering map-actions.\n\n- Added 'Empty workspace' button.\n\n- Added translations.\n\n\n1.28 (2010-12-09)\n-----------------\n\n- Finetuning hover popup.\n\n- Added point icons.\n\n\n1.27 (2010-12-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Added list operations coming from fewsjdbc.\n\n\n1.26 (2010-12-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Moved tooltip css to lizard_ui.\n\n\n1.25 (2010-11-25)\n-----------------\n\n- Add global to js file to satisfy jslint.\n\n\n1.24 (2010-11-24)\n-----------------\n\nAttention: You need to add 'django.core.context_processors.request' to\nyour TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in order to make map-locations work\ncorrectly.

The settings are set in settings.py.\n\n- Added option to set DEFAULT_START_DAYS and DEFAULT_END_DAYS in settings.\n\n\n1.17 (2010-10-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug where graph edit form would fail always unless you switched on\n  summaries per *month*.\n\n\n1.16 (2010-09-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Added option: allow_custom_legend in adapter.\n\n- Added optional transparency slider.\n\n- Fixed bug in graph edit and graph line edit popup forms.\n\n\n1.15 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed IE bug that most workspace-related icons floated one line down.\n\n\n1.14 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug in filter-on-month handling.\n\n- Using newer lizard-ui with better print icon handling.\n\n- Using color widget for legend customization.\n\n\n1.13 (2010-09-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix data attributes lizard-map-wms.

Add custom legend modification possibility.\n\n\n1.10 (2010-09-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Add never_cache to several server requests, to prevent caching in IE.\n\n- Fixed graph popup rendering problem for IE7 (empty <a> tags get hidden\n  there, even if there's an icon background).\n\n\n1.9 (2010-09-03)\n----------------\n\n- Use updated krw shapefiile.\n\n- Use different open street map.\n\n\n1.8 (2010-08-30)\n----------------\n\n- Bugfix for when no statistics are available.\n\n\n1.7 (2010-08-27)\n----------------\n\n- Graph and collage popups now use the \"regular\" jquerytools popup instead of\n  the OpenLayers in-the-map popup.  Visually cleaner, clearer and prettier.\n  And easier to maintain and to get right.\n\n- Various visual fixes.\n\n- Deleting a workspace item also deletes the corresponding snippets.\n\n- Added color pulldown for collage view settings (instead of requiring you to\n  know the internal matplotlib color code names :-) )\n\n\n1.6 (2010-08-26)\n----------------\n\n- Animation slider and name-hover are now also working in the default\n  workspace view.\n\n- Name hover is now placed just to the lower right of the cursor.  This way\n  you can still click on the item you hovered above instead of your click\n  being blocked sometimes by the hovering name.\n\n- Added slightly more whitespace to the right of legend-less graphs: this\n  prevents (most) labels from being cut off.\n\n\n1.5 (2010-08-26)\n----------------\n\n- Added tooltips with name when hovering over clickable map items.\n\n- Layout improvements for popups and tables.\n\n- Added dateperiods: calculate periods for use in graphs.\n\n- Added styling for popups.\n\n\n1.4 (2010-08-23)\n----------------\n\n- WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup's name was a TextField (=multiline) instead of\n  a simple CharField.  Oracle stores a TextField as a \"NCLOB\" and has some\n  restrictions on them (no index, no .distinct()).  Anyway, this blew up on\n  an oracle-using installation.  Fixed now.\n\n- Removed double value_aggregate() method from base adapter: the extra one\n  raised a NotImplemented error and overshadowed the real method.\n\n\n1.3 (2010-08-18)\n----------------\n\n- Requiring our dependencies that must be installed with system eggs.  We use\n  the osc.recipe.sysegg in our own buildout to grab them from the system.  A\n  sample config is included in the readme.\n\n- Implemented export csv for snippet_group.\n\n- Added optional legends.\n\n- Add option to show tables in collage view.\n\n- Importing the simplejson module in a different way to please windows in\n  combination with python 2.6.\n\n\n1.2 (2010-08-16)\n----------------\n\n- Added a bit of test setup to make xml test reports possible (for integration\n  with Hudson).  Similarly for coverage reports, also for Hudson.  Automatic\n  code quality monitoring!\n\n- Implemented snippet groups. Snippet groups group similar snippets in\n  a collage.\n\n- Removed site-specific breadcrumbs.\n\n- Refactored collage view. One can now edit graphs in the collage\n  view. The graph-only editor has been removed.\n\n- Added an animation slider for showing map layers at specific points in\n  time.  Only shown when there are workspace items that support it.\n\n- Removed graph-properties that were stored in the session.\n\n- Passing extra 'request' keyword argument to all adapter layer() methods.\n  **Warning**:  This needs refactoring in all adapters.  Advance warning:\n  we'll probably refactor the adapters to get the request in their\n  ``__init__()`` method later on.\n\n\n1.1 (2010-07-16)\n----------------\n\n- Changed json decode behaviour: keys are now strings, not unicode.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-07-15)\n----------------\n\n- Automatically empties temp workspace when adding item to workspace.\n- Add custom graph edit screen.\n- Add layout option to adapter.location for use with custom graphs.\n- Make generic adapter html rendering, for i.e. popups and collage\n  views.

Now it\n  isn't happening often enough, though.  Will be fixed later.\n\n\n0.8 (2010-06-18)\n----------------\n\n- Using lizard-ui's new css/javascript blocks.\n\n- Copied charts from krw here.\n\n\n0.7 (2010-06-16)\n----------------\n\n- \"Add to collage\" is now hardcoded NL.\n\n- Collage popup is bigger and doesn't contain \"add to collage\" links anymore.\n\n\n0.6 (2010-06-15)\n----------------\n\n- Added the date range popup widget from krw-waternet here.  (Still\n  session-based.  It also doesn't work with multiple workspaces yet.\n\n- Changed layer_method and other setuptools registered functions to an\n  adapter class.\n\n- Added fully functioning collages/snippets support.\n\n0.5 (2010-06-08)\n----------------\n\n- Added early support for collages/snippets.\n\n- Switched the custom attributes over to \"data-xxxxx\" attributes (those are\n  valid html5).\n\n- Added generic draggability of .workspace-acceptable items.\n\n\n0.4 (2010-05-18)\n----------------\n\n- Collected the rijksdriehoek and google mercator proj4 strings in one\n  location (coordinates.py).
