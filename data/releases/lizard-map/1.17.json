    "description": "lizard-map\n==========\n\nLizard-map provides basic map interaction for `Django\n<http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ applications that use a `lizard-ui\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui>`_ user interface.  We designed it at\n`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our geographical\ninformation websites (with water management information).\n\nIt provides:\n\n- Openlayers (map javascript libary) map display and server-side map\n  generation (mapnik's WMS functionality).\n\n- A \"workspace\" interaction model: drag mappable items into a workspace and\n  they'll get displayed.  The workspace is stored in the Django database.\n\n- A \"collage\" attached to every workspace for storing selected info on map\n  items (like graphs).\n\n- An extention mechanism to plug more or less arbitrary map sources into the\n  workspace so that they can be displayed, searched, etc.\n\n\nCore concept: workspaces\n------------------------\n\nA *workspace item* is something that can be displayed on a map.  A *workspace*\nis a collection of workspace items that is actually displayed.\n\nEvery session gets its own workspace.  (There is a possiblity of adding extra\nworkspaces, but that isn't used yet in one of our sites, so it isn't fully\nthought-out yet).\n\nA workspace item needs to know how to display itself, how to search for items\nwhen you click on the map and more.  To get that to work for arbitrary map\nsources, you need to configure an adapter.  The adapter has a ``layer()``\nmethod for returning a mapnik layer, a ``search()`` method for searching and\nso on.\n\n- You register an adapter as a so-called \"setuptools entrypoint\" under a\n  specfic name.\n\n- When you add a workspace item, you pass in the adapter name and an optional\n  snippet of json to configure the adapter.\n\nThe workspace item keeps track of this adapter and its configuragion and uses\nit to generate maps, for searching, etc.\n\n\nCollages\n--------\n\nA workspace item often results in multiple areas or points.  If you click on\nsuch a point, you normally get a popup with extra information.  If you want to\ncompare a couple of those information \"snippets\", you can place them in your\nworkspace's *collage*.\n\nClicking the collage gives a popup with all the collected information popups\nin that single popup.\n\n\nInteraction\n-----------\n\nIncluded is quite some javascript for workspace interaction.  Potential\nworkspace items can be drag/dropped into a workspace to add them.  Workspace\nitems can be reordered.  You can drag them to the trash.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nAlmost all dependencies are listed in our ``setup.py``, so they get pulled in\nautomatically.  Not all of them install as good as eggs, though.  You might be\nbetter off installing them system-wide with your OS's own packaging system.\n\nYou can force buildout to use system-wide installed packages with the\n`osc.recipe.sysegg <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/osc.recipe.sysegg>`_ recipe.\nAn example config::\n\n  [buildout]\n  ...\n  parts =\n      sysegg\n      ...\n\n  [sysegg]\n  recipe = osc.recipe.sysegg\n  force-sysegg = true\n  eggs =\n      PIL\n      matplotlib\n      simplejson\n      pyproj\n\n\nDevelopment installation\n------------------------\n\nThe first time, you'll have to run the \"bootstrap\" script to set up setuptools\nand buildout::\n\n    $> python bootstrap.py\n\nAnd then run buildout to set everything up::\n\n    $> bin/buildout\n\n(On windows it is called ``bin\\buildout.exe``).\n\nYou'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in\n``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.\n\nThe current package is installed as a \"development package\", so\nchanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python\nsetup.py develop``).\n\nIf you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released\nversions), add them as an \"svn external\" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory\nand add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.\n\nTests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\\test.exe``.\n\n\nExternal dependencies\n---------------------\n\nThe dependencies for a full website that uses lizard-map are best expressed as\nubuntu/debian package dependencies: build-essential, python2.6-dev, apache2,\nlibjpeg-dev, python-imaging, python-matplotlib, python-mapnik, python-scipy,\nlibapache2-mod-wsgi, python-gdal, spatialite-bin, python-pysqlite2,\npython-pyproj.\n\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\n- Add tests.  We're sorely lacking in that regard.\n\n- Add example app for stand-alone in-browser testing and trying-out.\n\n- Add possibility for multiple base layers.\n\n- Remove hardcoded Dutch-centric initial map extends.\n\n- More i18n/l10n.\n\n- Fix reloading when dragging an item to the trash.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- Main coders: Jack Ha and `Reinout van Rees\n  <http://reinout.vanrees.org>`_ (`Nelen & Schuurmans\n  <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_).\n\n- Core workspace interaction concept: Jan-Maarten Verbree and\n  Bastiaan Roos (`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_).\n\n\nChangelog of lizard-map\n=======================\n\n\n1.17 (2010-10-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug where graph edit form would fail always unless you switched on\n  summaries per *month*.\n\n\n1.16 (2010-09-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Added option: allow_custom_legend in adapter.\n\n- Added optional transparency slider.\n\n- Fixed bug in graph edit and graph line edit popup forms.\n\n\n1.15 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed IE bug that most workspace-related icons floated one line down.\n\n\n1.14 (2010-09-27)\n-----------------\n\n- Fixed bug in filter-on-month handling.\n\n- Using newer lizard-ui with better print icon handling.\n\n- Using color widget for legend customization.\n\n\n1.13 (2010-09-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Bugfix data attributes lizard-map-wms. Moved divs from above-content\n  to content.\n\n\n1.12 (2010-09-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Make 'now' line orange.\n\n\n1.11 (2010-09-20)\n-----------------\n\n- Added more tests (test coverage now at 62%).\n\n- Various UI and javascript fixes.\n\n- Showing aggregation period data in the statistics table.\n\n- Moved javascript out of map template into a separate javascript file: this\n  way the javascript can be tested automatically (and it is!).\n\n- \"Sleep items hierheen\" and \"Nog geen grafieken\" are not draggable anymore.\n\n- Add restrict-to-month option.\n\n- Percentile in collage screen is now user adjustable.\n\n- Move legend code to template tag. Add custom legend modification possibility.\n\n\n1.10 (2010-09-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Add never_cache to several server requests, to prevent caching in IE.\n\n- Fixed graph popup rendering problem for IE7 (empty <a> tags get hidden\n  there, even if there's an icon background).\n\n\n1.9 (2010-09-03)\n----------------\n\n- Use updated krw shapefiile.\n\n- Use different open street map.\n\n\n1.8 (2010-08-30)\n----------------\n\n- Bugfix for when no statistics are available.\n\n\n1.7 (2010-08-27)\n----------------\n\n- Graph and collage popups now use the \"regular\" jquerytools popup instead of\n  the OpenLayers in-the-map popup.  Visually cleaner, clearer and prettier.\n  And easier to maintain and to get right.\n\n- Various visual fixes.\n\n- Deleting a workspace item also deletes the corresponding snippets.\n\n- Added color pulldown for collage view settings (instead of requiring you to\n  know the internal matplotlib color code names :-) )\n\n\n1.6 (2010-08-26)\n----------------\n\n- Animation slider and name-hover are now also working in the default\n  workspace view.\n\n- Name hover is now placed just to the lower right of the cursor.  This way\n  you can still click on the item you hovered above instead of your click\n  being blocked sometimes by the hovering name.\n\n- Added slightly more whitespace to the right of legend-less graphs: this\n  prevents (most) labels from being cut off.\n\n\n1.5 (2010-08-26)\n----------------\n\n- Added tooltips with name when hovering over clickable map items.\n\n- Layout improvements for popups and tables.\n\n- Added dateperiods: calculate periods for use in graphs.\n\n- Added styling for popups.\n\n\n1.4 (2010-08-23)\n----------------\n\n- WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup's name was a TextField (=multiline) instead of\n  a simple CharField.  Oracle stores a TextField as a \"NCLOB\" and has some\n  restrictions on them (no index, no .distinct()).  Anyway, this blew up on\n  an oracle-using installation.  Fixed now.\n\n- Removed double value_aggregate() method from base adapter: the extra one\n  raised a NotImplemented error and overshadowed the real method.\n\n\n1.3 (2010-08-18)\n----------------\n\n- Requiring our dependencies that must be installed with system eggs.  We use\n  the osc.recipe.sysegg in our own buildout to grab them from the system.  A\n  sample config is included in the readme.\n\n- Implemented export csv for snippet_group.\n\n- Added optional legends.\n\n- Add option to show tables in collage view.\n\n- Importing the simplejson module in a different way to please windows in\n  combination with python 2.6.\n\n\n1.2 (2010-08-16)\n----------------\n\n- Added a bit of test setup to make xml test reports possible (for integration\n  with Hudson).  Similarly for coverage reports, also for Hudson.  Automatic\n  code quality monitoring!\n\n- Implemented snippet groups. Snippet groups group similar snippets in\n  a collage.\n\n- Removed site-specific breadcrumbs.\n\n- Refactored collage view. One can now edit graphs in the collage\n  view. The graph-only editor has been removed.\n\n- Added an animation slider for showing map layers at specific points in\n  time.  Only shown when there are workspace items that support it.\n\n- Removed graph-properties that were stored in the session.\n\n- Passing extra 'request' keyword argument to all adapter layer() methods.\n  **Warning**:  This needs refactoring in all adapters.  Advance warning:\n  we'll probably refactor the adapters to get the request in their\n  ``__init__()`` method later on.\n\n\n1.1 (2010-07-16)\n----------------\n\n- Changed json decode behaviour: keys are now strings, not unicode.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-07-15)\n----------------\n\n- Automatically empties temp workspace when adding item to workspace.\n- Add custom graph edit screen.\n- Add layout option to adapter.location for use with custom graphs.\n- Make generic adapter html rendering, for i.e. popups and collage\n  views. Refactored popup_json.\n- Add collage view.\n- Put date_popup in template tag.\n- Update wms.html for custom map-javascript code, for use with\n  lizard-sticky.\n- Add symbol function to adapter.\n- Add wgs84 support in coordinates.\n- Add GraphProps manager for keeping track of customized graphs.\n\n\n0.16 (2010-07-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Compensating for lizard-ui's \"use-my-size\" instead of \"use-my-width/height\"\n  class for image replacement.\n\n\n0.15 (2010-07-02)\n-----------------\n\n- Better empty height/width handling for images.\n\n- Slightly bigger search radius when clicking on a map.\n\n\n0.14 (2010-07-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Using lizard-ui's generic graph resizing and reloading now.\n\n\n0.13 (2010-06-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Popup graph size fixes.\n\n- Updated documentation.\n\n- We're now released on pypi!\n\n\n0.12 (2010-06-23)\n-----------------\n\n- Fancier \"nothing found\" popup.\n\n\n0.11 (2010-06-23)\n-----------------\n\n- UI interaction fixes.\n\n- Temp workspace popups don't show add-to-collage.\n\n- Added empty-the-workspace button.\n\n- Fixed graph display: no more overlap.\n\n- Added global graph settings.\n\n\n0.10 (2010-06-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Popup (upon map click) shows popup when nothing's found.\n\n- More feedback (hourglass pointer and so).\n\n\n0.9 (2010-06-18)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed wms.html's javascript code: long live jslint!\n\n- Not emptying the temp workspace anymore: it was happening too often.  Now it\n  isn't happening often enough, though.  Will be fixed later.\n\n\n0.8 (2010-06-18)\n----------------\n\n- Using lizard-ui's new css/javascript blocks.\n\n- Copied charts from krw here.\n\n\n0.7 (2010-06-16)\n----------------\n\n- \"Add to collage\" is now hardcoded NL.\n\n- Collage popup is bigger and doesn't contain \"add to collage\" links anymore.\n\n\n0.6 (2010-06-15)\n----------------\n\n- Added the date range popup widget from krw-waternet here.  (Still\n  session-based.  It also doesn't work with multiple workspaces yet.\n\n- Changed layer_method and other setuptools registered functions to an\n  adapter class.\n\n- Added fully functioning collages/snippets support.\n\n0.5 (2010-06-08)\n----------------\n\n- Added early support for collages/snippets.\n\n- Switched the custom attributes over to \"data-xxxxx\" attributes (those are\n  valid html5).\n\n- Added generic draggability of .workspace-acceptable items.\n\n\n0.4 (2010-05-18)\n----------------\n\n- Collected the rijksdriehoek and google mercator proj4 strings in one\n  location (coordinates.py).  Including handy conversion methods.\n\n- Added views for showing and managing workspaces.\n\n- Added workspaces and workspaceitems for showing map layers and de-coupling\n  them with behind-the-scenes data.\n\n- Added generic WMS view.\n\n- Added shapefile layer rendering function.\n\n- Added generic layer rendering and layer searching hook-ups through\n  so-called setuptools entrypoints.\n\n- Added template tags for rendering workspaces.\n\n\n0.3 (2010-04-14)\n----------------\n\n- Reordered templates a bit between lizard-ui and us.\n\n\n0.2 (2010-03-29)\n----------------\n\n- Really added analysis.html\n\n\n0.1 (2010-03-29)\n----------------\n\n- Moved analysis.html from krw-waternet to lizard-map\n- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.
