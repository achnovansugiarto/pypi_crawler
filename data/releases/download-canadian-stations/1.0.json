    "description": "This is a utility to download the current list of active weather stations in Canada.\n\nCurrently, this downloads information about the Environment Canada weather\nstations and produces a CSV file with their details including\n* Lat and Long\n* Various IDs used to identify the station\n* The station name\n* A link to the historical records for this station\n\nI wrote this utility to produce CSV files for use with Google's \"My Maps\" \nfeature.\n\n## Installation and use\n    # Using pip\n    pip3 install download-canadian-stations\n    \n    # If you want to pull from git, assuming you you have Python and pipenv installed\n    git clone https://github.com/timdaman/canadian-weather-station-downloader.git\n    cd canadian-weather-station-downloader\n    pipenv install\n    pipenv run ./download_stations.py\n\n## Why would I need a map of weather stations in Canada? \nI do lots of wilderness travel. I sometimes like to analyze recent weather data\nfor locations I will travel to in order to pack more efficiently and do better\nroute planning. This is especially useful in the winter where I try to\nanticipate lake ice and snow conditions.\n\nI find the way Environment Canada shows information about weather stations\npainful to use when trying to find the best station to draw data from. By\noverlaying the active stations on a map I can more easily determine the best\nchoice. The url field then makes it easy to jump to the data.\n\nBelow is a list of maps I have created using output from this script\n* Dec 2020 https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1yIqZFfyOTgg509UNoe03iD_1ht8&usp=sharing\n\n## Notes\nThe code assumes yesterday's data is always available. Weather Canada does not produce a list of stations\nuntil the end of the day is PST so this code always uses PST time to identify what day it is.\n\n## Disclaimers\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.",
