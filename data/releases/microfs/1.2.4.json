    "description": "MicroFS\n-------\n\nA simple command line tool and module for interacting with the limited\nfile system provided by MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit.\n\nInstallation\n++++++++++++\n\nTo install simply type::\n\n    $ pip install microfs\n\n...and the package will download from PyPI. If you wish to upgrade to the\nlatest version, use the following command::\n\n    $ pip install --no-cache --upgrade microfs\n\nUsage\n+++++\n\nThere are two ways to use microfs - as a module in your Python code or as a\nstand-alone command to use from your shell (``ufs``).\n\nIn Code\n=======\n\nIn your Python script import the required functions like this::\n\n    from microfs import ls, rm, put, get, get_serial\n\nRead the API documentation below to learn how each of the functions works.\n\nCommand Line\n============\n\nFrom the command line (but not the Python shell) use the \"ufs\" (\"u\" = micro)\ncommand.\n\nTo read the built-in help::\n\n    $ ufs --help\n\nList the files on the device::\n\n    $ ufs ls\n\nDelete a file on the device::\n\n    $ ufs rm foo.txt\n\nCopy a file onto the device::\n\n    $ ufs put path/to/local.txt\n\nGet a file from the device::\n\n    $ ufs get remote.txt\n\nThe ``put`` and ``get`` commands optionally take a further argument to specify\nthe name of the target file::\n\n    $ ufs put /path/to/local.txt remote.txt\n    $ ufs get remote.txt local.txt\n\nDevelopment\n+++++++++++\n\nThe source code is hosted in GitHub. Please feel free to fork the repository.\nAssuming you have Git installed you can download the code from the canonical\nrepository with the following command::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ntoll/microfs.git\n\nEnsure you have the correct dependencies for development installed by creating\na virtualenv and running::\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nTo locally install your development version of the module into a virtualenv,\nrun the following command::\n\n    $ python setup.py develop\n\nThere is a Makefile that helps with most of the common workflows associated\nwith development. Typing \"make\" on its own will list the options thus::\n\n    $make\n\n    There is no default Makefile target right now. Try:\n\n    make clean - reset the project and remove auto-generated assets.\n    make pyflakes - run the PyFlakes code checker.\n    make pep8 - run the PEP8 style checker.\n    make test - run the test suite.\n    make coverage - view a report on test coverage.\n    make check - run all the checkers and tests.\n    make package - create a deployable package for the project.\n    make publish - publish the project to PyPI.\n    make docs - run sphinx to create project documentation.\n\n\n\nRelease History\n===============\n\n1.2.3\n-----\n\n* Extensive debugging and a fix by Carlos Pereira Atencio to ensure that serial\n  connections are opened, closed and made ready for microfs related commands in\n  a robust manner.\n\n1.2.2\n-----\n\n* The get and put commands optionally take a further argument to specify the name of the target file.\n\n1.2.1\n-----\n\n* Made implicit string concatenation explicit.\n\n1.2.0\n-----\n\n* **API CHANGE** the serial object passed into command functions is optional.\n* **API CHANGE** call signature changes on command functions.\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n\n* Allow external modules to use built-in device detection and connection.\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n\n* Unlink command logic from device detection and serial connection.\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\n* Fix broken 'put' and 'get' commands to work with arbitrary file sizes.\n* Fix error when working with binary data.\n* Update execute function to work with lists of multiple commands.\n* Minor refactor to extract raw mode related code.\n* Updated tests to keep coverage at 100% on both Python 2 and Python 3.\n\n1.0.2\n-----\n\n* Remove spare print call.\n\n1.0.1\n-----\n\n* Fix broken setup.\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\n* Full implementation of all the expected features.\n* 100% test coverage.\n* Comprehensive documentation.\n\n0.0.1\n-----\n\n* Initial release. Basic functionality.\n",
