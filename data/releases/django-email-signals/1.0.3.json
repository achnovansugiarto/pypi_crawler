    "description": "# Django Email Signals\nA Django application that provides functionality to create signals via the admin panel which will send emails based on some changes to some models.\n\nThe application allows you to set your own constraints and email templates and aims to achieve this with minimal configuration.\n\n\n## Sections\n- [Django Email Signals](#django-email-signals)\n  - [Sections](#sections)\n  - [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n  - [Usage Example](#usage-example)\n    - [Creating the base signal](#creating-the-base-signal)\n    - [Setting the signal constraints](#setting-the-signal-constraints)\n    - [Template Context](#template-context)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n  - [Adding Signals](#adding-signals)\n  - [Playground](#playground)\n  - [Testing](#testing)\n\n## Use Cases\n**Admins are able to setup signals/emails themselves**\n\nIf an admin user has requested for an email to be sent when something happens on the database, what do we do? We developers create a new signal, set any constraints, create the email templates, piece everything together, create unit tests and then deploy. Relatively simple, but still time-consuming especially when there are multiple signals to set up for various changes. This quickly becomes a quite lengthy process.\n\nThis application aims to solve this by providing a way for admins to create these signals themselves rather than having to request the feature and wait for deployment. This is a great way to ease the pressure off developers whilst giving admins the ability to get results quickly.\n\n*How would an admin know what fields to enter for the params?*\nThe application validates the form before saving but also provides autocomplete for the fields.\n\n**Quickly prototyping and testing an email template**\n\nCreating and testing templates for some bigger teams can be a time-consuming process. This is particularly true when the request is from someone who for whatever reason cannot view your screen and relies on you deploying to a test environment to be able to test the template.\n\nThe process then can become a bit tedious. Ever been in a scenario where you deploy some code to test, have it reviewed, have to tweak some code, redeploy it, and have the process repeated a few times?\n\nThis application aims to solve this by providing a way for admins to create the HTML content themselves using a rich text editor. This allows admins to quickly prototype and test the email content themselves. Once ready, all they need to do is click on \"show source code\", and send that sweet source code to you.\n\n## Usage Example\nLet us imagine that we want to notify a particular team whenever a new order is placed on our website.\n\n### Creating the base signal\nWe would start off by setting the following signal:\n![Creating signal](img/creating-signal.png)\n\nIn this screenshot we notice a couple of things.\n\nThe **model** has been set to \"sample_app | order\". For this example we have created an order model (can be found in `example/sample_app/models.py`) and we have set **signal type** to **post save**.\n\nThis means that we are creating a post save signal on the order model.\n\nIn this example, we have entered values for the plain text and HTML content fields. This is fine to do when we do not need to add any additional context in the email. However, if we want to add additional context, we would need to provide a value in the **template** field instead.\n\nWe can also see that we have set **mailing list** to `new_order_mailing_list`. In our order model, we have a corresponding `new_order_mailing_list` method which returns a list of emails. This means, this particular email will be sent to the emails returned by `Order.new_order_mailing_list`. By creating various methods containing different lists of emails, we effectively have a way of creating different mailing lists.\n\nBefore we start to add any constraints, we nee to save the signal. This will make setting signal constraints easy as it will allow the autocomplete feature to help us. If you are worried about the time between saving the signal and setting the signal constraints, you can always set the **active** flag to false beforehand. This will prevent any email from being sent. \n\n\n### Setting the signal constraints\nWe can now set the constraints for the signal. We will create two constraints:\n1. Must be a new instance (`created == True`).\n2. Customer ID must be greater than 10 (`customer.id` > 10). \n\n![Setting Constraints](img/signals-constraint-setup.png)\n\nOne common check when creating a `post_save` signal is to check is the instance is a new instance. This can be done by setting the parameter to `created` and the comparison to \"Is True\".\n\nOur order model has a `customer` field which is a foreign key to the `customer` model. We can traverse through the `customer` object to get the `id` of the customer. We can then check if `customer.id > 10`.\n\nThe app has a handy autocomplete feature which will help you traverse through model fields and any cached properties. Don't worry about making any mistakes as there is validation in place to reject any parameters that can not be accessed.\n\nSaving this signal will now ensure that the signal will only be sent when the order is a new instance and the customer ID is greater than 10.\n\n### Template Context\nOften with emails we want to add actual context. When this is the case, we would not complete the plain text and HTML content fields, but instead we would set the template in the \"template\" field. Again, don't worry about making any mistakes here as there is validation in place to check that the template exists.\n\n## Installation\nTo install the application, run the following command:\n```\npip install django-email-signals\n```\n\nThe pip install command will be all that is required for most people, however if you want to look under the hood and see what's going on, you can clone the source directory:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Salaah01/django-email-signals.git\n```\n\n## Setup\n**1. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`**\ni. Add Add `ckeditor` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file.\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n  'app_1`,\n  'app_2`,\n  '...',\n  'ckeditor',\n]\n```\n\nii. Add Add `email_signals` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file. This should be added after any apps which contain models for which you would like to create signals using this application.\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n  'app_1`,\n  'app_2`,\n  '...',\n  'ckeditor',\n  'email_signals`\n]\n```\n\n**2. Run Migrations and Collect Static**\n```\npython manage.py migrate\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\n**3. Update URLs (Option)**\nUpdate your root `urls.py` file to include the following:\n```python\nfrom django.urls import include\n\nurl_patterns = [\n  path('email-signals/', include('email_signals.urls')),\n]\n```\nWe recommend changing the URL to something a bit harder to guess, just to make life harder for those pesky snoopers. The application paths all require the user to be a staff member to be able to access the links.\n\nThough this step is optional, we recommend doing it as it will make setting constraints in the admin area much easier. The URLs are needed to provide a dropdown with options when building your constraints.\n\n**4. Add a Default Email (Optional)**\nAdd `EMAIL_SIGNAL_DEFAULT_SENDER` to your settings.\ne.g: `EMAIL_SIGNAL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'someone@mail.com`\nIf you don't want to explicitly specify a sender email for every signal you define, you can set `EMAIL_SIGNAL_DEFAULT_SENDER` in your project `settings.py`.\n\n**5. Add the Model Mixin**\nOn the models that you want to raise signals, you will need to add the following mixin as a dependency to the models: `email_signals.models.EmailSignalMixin`.\n\nExample:\nLet's suppose you have the following model.\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Customer(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True)\n    email = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n```\nYou would need to change this model to the following:\n\n```python\nfrom email_signals.models import EmailSignalMixin\n\nclass Customer(models.Model, EmailSignalMixin):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True)\n    email = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n```\n\n**6. Add Recipients**\nDepending on the change to the data, you may want to send an email to different people. We facilitate this by setting up the various possible mailing lists into the model itself. This one is easier to show first then explain:\n\n```python\nfrom email_signals.models import EmailSignalMixin\n\nclass Customer(models.Model, EmailSignalMixin):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True)\n    email = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n\n    def customer_emails(self):\n        \"\"\"Recipient is the customer.\"\"\"\n        return [self.email]\n\n    def management_mailing_list(self):\n        \"\"\"Recipient list includes management.\"\"\"\n        return ['manager@somewhere.com', 'supervisor@somewhere.com']\n```\n\nWe've created two functions called `customer_emails` and `management_mailing_list` which each return a collection of email addresses. Later on, when we setup the signals, we will be asked to set the mailing list to use for each signal. This is where we would enter our function names ``customer_emails` or `management_mailing_list`.\n\nThis therefore, allows us to set up different mailing lists within our models.\n## Adding Signals\nNow that the setup is complete, signals can be added via the admin (or by updating the database directly).\n\nWe will imagine I am running a site on localhost and so the admin panel can be found by navigating to http://localhost:8000/admin/. The signals can then be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8000/admin/email_signals/signal/. We will start by adding some signals. Click on \"add signal\" to get started.\n\nA wise man taught me *it's better to sound silly for a moment than not know something and feel stupid forever*. So, in that vein, though it might seem obvious, we'll go through the options in the form and discuss what each option\nis responsible for.\n\n| Field Label      | Field Name       | Description                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Name             | name             | An name for your signal, just to make it easier to distinguish from other records.                                             |\n| Description      | description      | (Optional) Description for your signal.                                                                                        |\n| Model (Table)    | content_type     | Choose from the drop down the model this signal relates to.                                                                                        |\n| Plain text content | plain_message | (Optional) Plain text email to send.                                                                                           |\n| HTML content       | html_message       | (Optional) HTML email to send.                                                                                                 |\n| Subject          | subject          | Email subject                                                                                                                  |\n| From email       | from_email       | (Optional) The email sender.

This parameter can be left empty when the constraint is something sensible. For example, if constraint is \"Is True\" then there is no need for parameter 2. But if the constraint is, \"Greater Than\", then parameter 2 is needed. Parameter 2 can also be a primitive type such as 'a', '1', '1.1'. The application will attempt to convert strings into numbers if it can. |\n\n**Parameters are Deep**\nBoth parameters 1 and 2 allow you to search deep inside an object.\nLet's suppose we have the following structure and signal has received a `CustomerOrder` instance.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    User <| -- Customer\n    Customer <| -- CustomerOrder\n\n    class User {\n      id\n      first_name\n      last_name\n      email\n    }\n\n    class Customer {\n      id\n      user\n      fav_language\n    }\n\n    class CustomerOrder {\n      id\n      customer\n      order_id\n      total\n    }\n```\n\nGiven a `CustomerOrder` instance (we'll call this variable `order`), we can set the following in our constraints:\n\n| \\#  | Parameter 1                  | Comparison   | Parameter 2                 |\n| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |\n| 1   | `'customer.user.id'`         | Greater Than | `'5'`                       |\n| 2   | `'customer.user.first_name'` | Equal To     | `'customer.user.last_name'` |\n\nConstraint 1 will check the following:\n```python\norder.customer.user.id > 5\n```\nSimilarly, constraint 2 will check the following:\n```python\norder.customer.user.first_name == order.customer.user.last_name\n```\n\nOnly when all constraints are satisfied will the email be sent.\n\n## Playground\nThe repository comes with an example project to get you started. If you prefer to test this application yourself then I recommend cloning the repository.\n\nNavigating to `example` and running the Django project inside.\n\n\n## Testing\nIn the root of the project there is a `runtests.py` file which can be used to run the tests.\n\n\n",
