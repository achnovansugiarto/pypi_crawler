    "description": "# malwaretl_stoq_transformer\nTransform step in malwarETL pipeline for captured files\n\nThis includes a few clustom stoQ plugins:\n 1. A custom EMBER-format Lief because I want to make sure the data collected here matches the \nEMBER dataset format. The `to_json` LIEF method does not include some values if they're False, empty lists, etc in \nthe final json, and that is a problem for training since those are values that I want to be able to learn on. Also,\nsome of the values were strangely different (`len(lief_obj.imported_functions) != len(lief_json[\"imports}]`) so I could\nnot be convinced that the json dump was clearly comparable to the EMBER dataset data.\n 2. A custom version of the regular Lief plugin, because the lief library is looking for input as a list, rather than as a\nstraight bytestring, so the default Lief plugin didn't work.\n 3. A custom dispatcher that looks at the mimetype of a file, and selectively dispatches files to workers depending on the mimetype.\n\n\nThis project is designed to be used in two ways (at the same time):\n    1. Collector or Transformer projects import the library, get a stoq instance for their collector, and progressively hand\n        files to that instance for scanning as they download them.\n    2. Collector or Transformer projects use the Docker image generated here as the base image for their images, so that\n        the stoq requirements are pre-installed in their starting image.\n\n\nThe original Stoq plugins that I modified were licensed under the Apache License, and are copyrighted by the \nPUNCH Cyber Analytics Group.\n\n",
