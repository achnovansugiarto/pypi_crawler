    "description": "Dynamic Scope in Python\n=======================\n\nThis module implements dynamic scope for Python: it allows Python code\nto get and set variables defined anywhere in its call stack, searching\nfirst its own local variables, then its caller's local variables, and\nso on, until it finds a variable with the desired name.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to only use this module for education, fun\nparty tricks, and write-only throw-away code which no one will ever\nneed to reuse or maintain.\n\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nThis library's version numbers follow the `SemVer 2.0.0\nspecification <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    pip install macaddress\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nImport:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from dynamicscope import DYNAMIC_SCOPE\n\nTo get a variable named ``x`` in the current dynamic scope:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    DYNAMIC_SCOPE.x\n\n.. NOTE:: Dynamic scope starts with *your* stack frame, not your caller's\n   stack frame, so if you have a variable named ``x`` in the local scope,\n   ``DYNAMIC_SCOPE.x`` will refer to that ``x``, not bypass it.\n\nTo overwrite a existing variable named ``x`` in the current dynamic scope:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    DYNAMIC_SCOPE.x = 'foo'\n\nTo delete a variable named ``x`` found in the current dynamic scope:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    del DYNAMIC_SCOPE.x\n\n.. DANGER:: Reaching up from a lower scope to delete variables in callers\n   without consent is a GOTO-level crime under international software law.\n\nIf a variable is not found in dynamic scope, an ``AttributeError`` is raised:\n\n.. code::\n\n    AttributeError: 'x' was not found in dynamic scope\n\n(It is an ``AttributeError`` and not a ``NameError`` because dynamic scope\nis accessed with attribute access - returning the standard error for\nattribute access composes better with existing code and builtins like\n``hasattr``, ``getattr``, and ``delattr``.)\n\nGetting and setting variables with dynamic scope is not always possible\nin Python. Two errors, both subclasses of ``RuntimeError``, are defined\nto help you detect when it cannot be done:\n\n* If the stack cannot be inspected to find variables during either\n  a get, set, or delete: a ``dynamicscope.ReadError`` is raised.\n\n* If the stack cannot be modified during a set or delete:\n  a ``dynamicscope.WriteError`` is raised.\n\nCaution\n~~~~~~~\n\n**Most languages to not have dynamic scope for really good reason.**\n\nIn a world where dynamic scope is used, *your local variables are part\nof your observable interface*, and the only thing protecting two\npieces of code from trampling over or shadowing each others' variables\nis conventions about how things are named. For example:\n\n* ``{{your module name}}_foo`` for any variable that you intend for\n  your users to set or get through dynamic scope, and\n\n* ``_{{your module name}}_foo`` for any variable that you intend for\n  your code to privately set or get through dynamic scope.\n\nDetails\n~~~~~~~\n\n``dynamicscope`` works by using Python's stack frame inspection,\nspecifically |currentframe|_, and |f_locals|.\n\n.. |currentframe| replace:: ``inspect.currentframe()``\n.. _currentframe:\n    https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.currentframe\n\n.. |f_locals| replace:: the ``.f_locals`` attribute of frame objects.\n.. _f_locals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#frame-objects\n\n\n",
