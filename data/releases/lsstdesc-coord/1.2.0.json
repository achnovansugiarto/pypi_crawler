    "description": ".. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/LSSTDESC/Coord.svg?branch=master\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/LSSTDESC/Coord\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/LSSTDESC/Coord/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n        :target: https://codecov.io/gh/LSSTDESC/Coord\n\nCoord is a Python module that provides basic functionality related to angles and\ncelestial coordinates.\n\nIt is similar in functionality to the astropy.coordinates module, but with more of an\nemphasis on efficiency.  Some functions are more than 100 times faster than the corresponding\nfunctionality in astropy.  On the other hand, the API is somewhat more restrictive than\nthe API used by astropy, so the appropriate module to use will depend on your needs.\n\nNotable functionality:\n\n* Spherical geometric calculations of the distance between two points, angles in spherical\n  triangles, and areas of spherical triangles.\n* Tangent-plane projection of a coordinate relative to a given center point of the projection.\n* Deprojection back into spherical coordinates.\n* Analytic calculation of the jacobian of the tangent projection.\n* Precession calculations between different epochs.\n* Conversion to galactic and ecliptic coordinate systems (and back).\n\nThe code was originally written by Mike Jarvis for TreeCorr and then also used in GalSim.\nIt has been republished here as a stand-alone module to enable others (within the LSST DESC\nor not) to have easier access to these functions.\n\nOne missing feature (for which pull requests would be welcome) is conversion between FK5 and ICRS\nsystems (or even FK4).  If you care about the slight differences between these systems, then you\nshould probably stick to astropy, which does handle these distinctions.\n\nAside: The module was used as a pedagogical tool at the LSST DESC DE School on July 9, 2017.\nA video of the `lesson <http://www.lsst-desc.org/DEschool#MikeJarvis>`_ can be viewed\n`here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3x5OEXgtnU>`_.\n\nLicence\n=======\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT License, which basically means you can use it in any way\nyou want, so long as you keep the copyright notice at the top of each source file and/or include\nthe accompanying LICENSE file with the distribution.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstalling libffi\n-----------------\n\nThis module is mostly pure Python.  However, it does have a small bit of C++ code, which is\nwrapped with cffi.  This in turn depends on libffi, which is not itself pip installable.\nMost modern Python installations will have this already installed, so you probably don't have\nto do anything special to use it.  However, if not, installing libffi is fairly straightforward:\n\nOn a Mac, you should only need to run the command::\n\n    $ xcode-select --install\n\nOn Linux, if you have root access, then one of the following should work for you::\n\n    $ apt-get install libffi-dev\n    $ yum install libffi-devel\n\nIf you don't have root access (and don't want to bother your sysadmin), then installing from\nsource into a {prefix} directory where you have write access (e.g. your home directory) is also\nnot very hard::\n\n    $ wget ftp://sourceware.org:/pub/libffi/libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz\n    $ tar xfz libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz\n    $ cd libffi-3.2.1\n    $ ./configure --prefix={prefix}\n    $ make\n    $ make install\n    $ cp */include/ffi*.h {prefix}/include\n    $ cd ..\n\nInstalling Coord\n----------------\n\nOnce you have done one of the above (or not if you already have libffi installed), you can\ninstall Coord with pip::\n\n    $ pip install LSSTDESC.Coord --user\n\nor if you have root access, you might prefer::\n\n    $ sudo pip install LSSTDESC.Coord\n\nor possibly with neither ``sudo`` nor ``--user`` if your Python distro is in a writable directory.\n\nIf you prefer to download or clone the repo and install manually, you can install with\nsetup.py using one of the usual variants::\n\n    $ python setup.py install --prefix={prefix}\n\nor::\n\n    $ sudo python setup.py install",
