It handles dependency resolution, workflow management,\n        visualization, handling failures, command line integration, and much more.\n        \n        Getting Started\n        ---------------\n        \n        Run ``pip install luigi`` to install the latest stable version from `PyPI\n        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/luigi>`_. `Documentation for the latest release\n        <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ is hosted on readthedocs.\n        \n        Run ``pip install luigi[toml]`` to install Luigi with `TOML-based configs\n        <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html>`__ support.\n        \n        For the bleeding edge code, ``pip install\n        git+https://github.com/spotify/luigi.git``. `Bleeding edge documentation\n        <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is also available.\n        \n        Background\n        ----------\n        \n        The purpose of Luigi is to address all the plumbing typically associated\n        with long-running batch processes. You want to chain many tasks,\n        automate them, and failures *will* happen. These tasks can be anything,\n        but are typically long running things like\n        `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org/>`_ jobs, dumping data to/from\n        databases, running machine learning algorithms, or anything else.\n        \n        There are other software packages that focus on lower level aspects of\n        data processing, like `Hive <http://hive.apache.org/>`__,\n        `Pig <http://pig.apache.org/>`_, or\n        `Cascading <http://www.cascading.org/>`_. Luigi is not a framework to\n        replace these. Instead it helps you stitch many tasks together, where\n        each task can be a `Hive query <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.hive.html>`__,\n        a `Hadoop job in Java <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.hadoop_jar.html>`_,\n        a  `Spark job in Scala or Python <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.spark.html>`_,\n        a Python snippet,\n        `dumping a table <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.sqla.html>`_\n        from a database, or anything else. It's easy to build up\n        long-running pipelines that comprise thousands of tasks and take days or\n        weeks to complete. Luigi takes care of a lot of the workflow management\n        so that you can focus on the tasks themselves and their dependencies.\n        \n        You can build pretty much any task you want, but Luigi also comes with a\n        *toolbox* of several common task templates that you use. It includes\n        support for running\n        `Python mapreduce jobs <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.hadoop.html>`_\n        in Hadoop, as well as\n        `Hive <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.hive.html>`__,\n        and `Pig <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.pig.html>`__,\n        jobs. It also comes with\n        `file system abstractions for HDFS <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.hdfs.html>`_,\n        and local files that ensures all file system operations are atomic. This\n        is important because it means your data pipeline will not crash in a\n        state containing partial data.\n        \n        Visualiser page\n        ---------------\n        \n        The Luigi server comes with a web interface too, so you can search and filter\n        among all your tasks.\n        \n        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotify/luigi/master/doc/visualiser_front_page.png\n           :alt: Visualiser page\n        \n        Dependency graph example\n        ------------------------\n        \n        Just to give you an idea of what Luigi does, this is a screen shot from\n        something we are running in production. Using Luigi's visualiser, we get\n        a nice visual overview of the dependency graph of the workflow. Each\n        node represents a task which has to be run. Green tasks are already\n        completed whereas yellow tasks are yet to be run. Most of these tasks\n        are Hadoop jobs, but there are also some things that run locally and\n        build up data files.\n        \n        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotify/luigi/master/doc/user_recs.png\n           :alt: Dependency graph\n        \n        Philosophy\n        ----------\n        \n        Conceptually, Luigi is similar to `GNU\n        Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ where you have certain tasks\n        and these tasks in turn may have dependencies on other tasks. There are\n        also some similarities to `Oozie <http://oozie.apache.org/>`_\n        and `Azkaban <http://data.linkedin.com/opensource/azkaban>`_. One major\n        difference is that Luigi is not just built specifically for Hadoop, and\n        it's easy to extend it with other kinds of tasks.\n        \n        Everything in Luigi is in Python. Instead of XML configuration or\n        similar external data files, the dependency graph is specified *within\n        Python*. This makes it easy to build up complex dependency graphs of\n        tasks, where the dependencies can involve date algebra or recursive\n        references to other versions of the same task. However, the workflow can\n        trigger things not in Python, such as running\n        `Pig scripts <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.pig.html>`_\n        or `scp'ing files <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/luigi.contrib.ssh.html>`_.\n        \n        Who uses Luigi?\n        ---------------\n        \n        We use Luigi internally at `Spotify <https://www.spotify.com>`_ to run\n        thousands of tasks every day, organized in complex dependency graphs.\n        Most of these tasks are Hadoop jobs. Luigi provides an infrastructure\n        that powers all kinds of stuff including recommendations, toplists, A/B\n        test analysis, external reports, internal dashboards, etc.\n        \n        Since Luigi is open source and without any registration walls, the exact number\n        of Luigi users is unknown. But based on the number of unique contributors, we\n        expect hundreds of enterprises to use it. Some users have written blog posts\n        or held presentations about Luigi:\n        \n        * `Spotify <https://www.spotify.com>`_ `(presentation, 2014) <http://www.slideshare.net/erikbern/luigi-presentation-nyc-data-science>`__\n        * `Foursquare <https://foursquare.com/>`_ `(presentation, 2013) <http://www.slideshare.net/OpenAnayticsMeetup/luigi-presentation-17-23199897>`__\n        * `Mortar Data (Datadog) <https://www.datadoghq.com/>`_ `(documentation / tutorial) <http://help.mortardata.com/technologies/luigi>`__\n        * `Stripe <https://stripe.com/>`_ `(presentation, 2014) <http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/python-as-part-of-a-production-machine-learning-stack-by-michael-manapat-pydata-sv-2014>`__\n        * `Asana <https://asana.com/>`_ `(blog, 2014) <https://eng.asana.com/2014/11/stable-accessible-data-infrastructure-startup/>`__\n        * `Buffer <https://buffer.com/>`_ `(blog, 2014) <https://overflow.bufferapp.com/2014/10/31/buffers-new-data-architecture/>`__\n        * `SeatGeek <https://seatgeek.com/>`_ `(blog, 2015) <http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/building-out-the-seatgeek-data-pipeline/>`__\n        * `Treasure Data <https://www.treasuredata.com/>`_ `(blog, 2015) <http://blog.treasuredata.com/blog/2015/02/25/managing-the-data-pipeline-with-git-luigi/>`__\n        * `Growth Intelligence <http://growthintel.com/>`_ `(presentation, 2015) <http://www.slideshare.net/growthintel/a-beginners-guide-to-building-data-pipelines-with-luigi>`__\n        * `AdRoll <https://www.adroll.com/>`_ `(blog, 2015) <http://tech.adroll.com/blog/data/2015/09/22/data-pipelines-docker.html>`__\n        * 17zuoye `(presentation, 2015) <https://speakerdeck.com/mvj3/luiti-an-offline-task-management-framework>`__\n        * `Custobar <https://www.custobar.com/>`_ `(presentation, 2016) <http://www.slideshare.net/teemukurppa/managing-data-workflows-with-luigi>`__\n        * `Blendle <https://launch.blendle.com/>`_ `(presentation) <http://www.anneschuth.nl/wp-content/uploads/sea-anneschuth-streamingblendle.pdf#page=126>`__\n        * `TrustYou <http://www.trustyou.com/>`_ `(presentation, 2015) <https://speakerdeck.com/mfcabrera/pydata-berlin-2015-processing-hotel-reviews-with-python>`__\n        * `Groupon <https://www.groupon.com/>`_ / `OrderUp <https://orderup.com>`_ `(alternative implementation) <https://github.com/groupon/luigi-warehouse>`__\n        * `Red Hat -
