The intended use\ncase is as an email relay for a home lab or network. By accepting ordinary\nemail, Mailrise enables Linux servers, Internet of Things devices, surveillance\nsystems, and outdated software to gain access to the full suite of 60+\nnotification services supported by Apprise, from Matrix to Nextcloud to your\ndesktop or mobile device.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoRyan/mailrise/main/src/mailrise/asset/homelab-diagram.png\n  :alt: A block diagram demonstrating how Mailrise can accept emails from a\n        variety of sources and produce notifications for a variety of services\n\nJust as email brought written messages into the 21st century, Mailrise\nbrings email notifications into the year 2021 and beyond. Compared to a\nconventional SMTP server, it's more secure, tooâ€”no more replicating your Gmail\npassword to each of your Linux boxes!\n\n    \"After a few very negative experiences with mail providers and their\n    detection of spam accounts in the last year... Fuck email. I will never set\n    up a mail account for notifications. And with Mailrise I don't have to\n    anymore!\"\n\n    -- `u/Sarcism <https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/wwx0ue/comment/ilnqhkf/>`_\n\nA Mailrise daemon is configured with a list of Apprise\n`configuration files <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config_yaml>`_.\nEmail senders encode the name of the desired configuration file into the\nrecipient address. Mailrise then constructs the resulting Apprise\nnotification(s) using the selected configuration.\n\nA minimalist Mailrise configuration, for example, might contain a single Apprise\nconfiguration for Pushover::\n\n    configs:\n      pushover:\n        urls:\n          - pover://[...]\n\nAnd email senders would be able to select this configuration by using the\nrecipient address::\n\n    pushover@mailrise.xyz\n\nBy appending ``.<type>`` to the username component of the address, it is also\npossible to specify one of the four Apprise\n`notification types <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Development_API#message-types-and-themes>`_,\nwhich, if the service you selected supports it, will change the color of the\nicon of the resulting notification::\n\n    discord.failure@mailrise.xyz\n\nEmail attachments will also pass through to Apprise if the addressed\nnotification service(s) support attachments.\n\nMailrise is the sucessor to\n`SMTP Translator <https://github.com/YoRyan/smtp-translator>`_, a previous\nproject of mine that articulated a similar concept but was designed solely for\nPushover.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nAs a Docker container\n---------------------\n\nAn official Docker image is available\n`from Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/yoryan/mailrise>`_. To use it, you\nmust bind mount a configuration file to ``/etc/mailrise.conf``.\n\nFrom PyPI\n---------\n\nYou can find Mailrise `on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mailrise/>`_. The\nminimum Python version is 3.8+.\n\nOnce installed, you should write a configuration file and then configure Mailrise\nto run as a service. Here is the suggested systemd unit file::\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Mailrise SMTP notification relay\n    \n    [Service]\n    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mailrise /etc/mailrise.conf\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nFrom source\n-----------\n\nThis repository is structured like any other Python package. To install it in\neditable mode for development or debugging purposes, use::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\nTo build a wheel, use::\n\n    tox -e build\n\nIf you are using Visual Studio Code, a\n`development container <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers>`_\nis included with all the Python tooling necessary for working with Mailrise.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe ``mailrise`` program accepts a path to a YAML configuration file that\nencapsulates the daemon's entire configuration. The root node of this file should\nbe a dictionary. Mailrise accepts the following keys (periods denote\nsub-dictionaries):\n\n====================================== ========== ==========================================================================\nKey                                    Type       Value\n====================================== ========== ==========================================================================\nconfigs.<name>                         dictionary ``<name>`` denotes the email address associated with the configuration.\n                                                  Senders should address their emails to this address. ``<name>`` can be a\n                                                  full email address, such as ``notify@mydomain.com``, or it can be a\n                                                  username only, such as ``notify``, in which case the default\n                                                  ``mailrise.xyz`` domain will be added (resulting in the full email address\n                                                  ``notify@mailrise.xyz``).\n\n                                                  `fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html>`_ pattern\n                                                  matching tokens are also accepted here, though they are considered special\n                                                  characters in YAML and therefore must be enclosed in quoted strings.\n                                                  Please also note that the domain component still defaults to\n                                                  ``mailrise.xyz``, so to match any username on any domain, use ``*@*``.\n\n                                                  Please note that the period character is reserved for sender flags, so it\n                                                  cannot be used in the username component of the address.\n                                                  ``bad.address`` is not okay, and neither is ``bad.address@mydomain.com``.\n\n                                                  The dictionary value is the Apprise\n                                                  `YAML configuration <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config_yaml>`_\n                                                  itself, exactly as it would be specified in a standalone file for Apprise.\n\n                                                  In addition to the Apprise configuration, some Mailrise-exclusive options\n                                                  can be specified under this key.
