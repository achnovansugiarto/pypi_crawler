The intended use\ncase is as an email relay for a home lab or network. By accepting ordinary\nemail, Mailrise enables Linux servers, Internet of Things devices, surveillance\nsystems, and outdated software to gain access to the full suite of 60+\nnotification services supported by Apprise, from Matrix to Nextcloud to your\ndesktop or mobile device.\n\nJust as email brought written messages into the 21st century, Mailrise\nbrings email notifications into the year 2021 and beyond. Compared to a\nconventional SMTP server, it's more secure, tooâ€”no more replicating your Gmail\npassword to each of your Linux boxes!\n\nA Mailrise daemon is configured with a list of Apprise\n`configuration files <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config_yaml>`_.\nEmail senders encode the name of the desired configuration file into the\nrecipient address. Mailrise then constructs the resulting Apprise\nnotification(s) using the selected configuration.\n\nA minimalist Mailrise configuration, for example, might contain a single Apprise\nconfiguration for Pushover::\n\n    configs:\n      pushover:\n        urls:\n          - pover://[...]\n\nAnd email senders would be able to select this configuration by using the\nrecipient address::\n\n    pushover@mailrise.xyz\n\nIt is also possible to specify one of the four Apprise\n`notification types <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Development_API#message-types-and-themes>`_::\n\n    pushover.failure@mailrise.xyz\n\nEmail attachments will also pass through to Apprise if the addressed\nnotification service(s) support attachments.\n\nMailrise is the sucessor to\n`SMTP Translator <https://github.com/YoRyan/smtp-translator>`_, a previous\nproject of mine that articulated a similar concept but was designed solely for\nPushover.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nAs a Docker container\n---------------------\n\nAn official Docker image is available\n`from Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/yoryan/mailrise>`_. To use it, you\nmust bind mount a configuration file to ``/etc/mailrise.conf``.\n\nFrom PyPI\n---------\n\nYou can find Mailrise `on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mailrise/>`_.\n\nOnce installed, you should write a configuration file and then configure Mailrise\nto run as a service. Here is the suggested systemd unit file::\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Mailrise SMTP notification relay\n    \n    [Service]\n    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mailrise /etc/mailrise.conf\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nFrom source\n-----------\n\nThis repository is structured like any other Python package. To install it in\neditable mode for development or debugging purposes, use::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\nTo build a wheel, use::\n\n    tox -e build\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe ``mailrise`` program accepts a path to a YAML configuration file that\nencapsulates the daemon's entire configuration. The root node of this file should\nbe a dictionary. Mailrise accepts the following keys (periods denote\nsub-dictionaries):\n\n============= ========== ========================================================\nKey           Type       Value\n============= ========== ========================================================\nconfigs       dictionary Contains the Apprise configurations. The key is the\n                         name of the configuration and the value is the\n                         `YAML configuration <https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config_yaml>`_\n                         itself, exactly as it would be specified in a standalone\n                         file for Apprise.\n\n                         The configuration name must *not* contain a period.\nlisten.host   string     Specifies the network address to listen on.\n\n                         Defaults to all interfaces.\nlisten.port   number     Specifies the network port to listen on.\n\n                         Defaults to 8025.\ntls.mode      string     Selects the operating mode for TLS encryption. Must be\n                         ``off``, ``onconnect``, ``starttls``, or\n                         ``starttlsrequire``.\n\n                         Defaults to off.\ntls.certfile  string     If TLS is enabled, specifies the path to the certificate\n                         chain file. This file must be unencrypted and in PEM\n                         format.\ntls.keyfile   string     If TLS is enabled, specifies the path to the key file.\n                         This file must be unencrypted and in PEM format.\nsmtp.hostname string     Specifies the hostname used when responding to the EHLO\n                         command.\n\n                         Defaults to the system FQDN.\n============= ========== ========================================================\n\n\n.. _pyscaffold-notes:\n\nNote\n====\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.0.2.
