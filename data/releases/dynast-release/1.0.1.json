In addition, dynast can perform statistical estimation of these species through expectation maximization (EM) and Bayesian inference.\n\n### Key features\n* Complete quantification of labeling and splicing of RNA.\n    * Unlabeled unspliced, unlabeled spliced, labeled unspliced, labeled spliced species quantification.\n    * Highly paralellized and optimized pipeline procedures.\n* Statistical estimation procedure that corrects the observed unlabeled and labeled counts via a Bayesian inference framework.",
