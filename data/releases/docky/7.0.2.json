    "description": "Introduction\n=================\n\ndocky : Make docker and docker compose simply !\n\n\nHistory\n----------\nThis project was initialy created for building odoo environments without effort based on docker-compose and docker\n\nStep by step we make it generic and now we also use it for our rails, ruby developpment\n\nHow it works\n---------------\n\nDocky is depend on docker-compose and use exactly the same file (so you can move from docker-compose to docky and vice-versa without any effort)\n\nDocky just make docker-compose simplier and integrate a default docker-compose file generator\n\n\nInstallation and Update\n-------------------------\n\nYou need to install docker-ce : https://docs.docker.com/install/\n\n\n\n\nFor the installation we recommand to install pipx https://pypi.org/project/pipx/\n\nThen install docky with pipx\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pipx install docky --include-deps\n\n\nUpdate Docky:\n------------------\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pipx upgrade docky --include-deps\n\nConfiguration:\n--------------\n\nBootstrap a project with :\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    docky init\n\n\nDocky Labels\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe label docky.main.service and docky.user\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    docky.main.service: odoo\n    docky.user: odoo\n\nAllow to define the main service of your docker compose and the user that should be user to enter in the container\n\nGetting Started\n---------------------\n\nUse docky --help\n\nBut basically docky run is your friend\n\nREAD the documentation: `Docky documentation <https://github.com/akretion/docky/blob/master/doc/command_line.rst>`_\n\n\n[Optionnal] Automatic Proxy\n-----------------------------\n\nWhen doing dev, is quickly a mess to manage the port of your container\n\nPrevious version of docky was including a proxy based on nginx docker image.\nThis solution was adding some restriction (like using the same network for all container)\nNow we recommands to simply install traefik and dns resolver like dnsmasq on your host.\n\nSee documentation : `Install Traefik <https://github.com/akretion/docky/blob/master/doc/install_traefik.rst>`_\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n--------------------\n\nTo avoid issue with line wrapping with \"docky open\" please use a version of docker > to  18.06.0-ce\nsee : https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6151\n\nOther issue :\nsee https://github.com/akretion/docky/wiki\n\nChangelog\n----------\n\nversion 7.0.0\n\n- remove the need of docky config file in $HOME\n- use .env to be more compatible with docker-compose\n- improve templates\n- create init command\n- heavy refactoring\n\n\nversion 6.0.0\n\n- refactor remove proxy code and use traefik\n- remove docky.yml now you must use labels on services (see doc)\n- add option \"--service=myservice\" on docky run and docky open\n\nversion 5.0.0:\n\n- Resolve mac compatibility by remove proxy code that use a mounted version of etc/hosts\n  now you need to install dnsmasq.\n  This should also solve windows compatibilty by using the local dns https://stackoverflow.com/questions/138162/wildcards-in-a-windows-hosts-file?answertab=votes#tab-top\n- Solve issue with project name in multi user env (the name is based on user + directory name)\n- Add possibility to specify the service for run, open, logs, kill, down, restart, start cmd\n  for example now you can do \"docky open db\" to open a terminal on the db server\n  or you can restart a service like \"docky restart varnish\"\n- Solve issue with missing aliases name\n- Solve issue with missing environment variable with docky open (now we use a monkey-pacthed version of docker-compose exec)\n- Fix documentation build\n- Improve docky none specific cmd to a project to be run without project.\n  For example, you can use docky help, docky proxy outside of a directory project\n\n\n",
