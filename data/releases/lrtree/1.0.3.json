(see [manuscript](https://github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these) or [web article](https://adimajo.github.io/logistic_trees.html))\n\n## Getting started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThis code is supported on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.\n\n### Installing the package\n\n#### Installing the development version\n\nIf `git` is installed on your machine, you can use:\n\n```PowerShell\npipenv install git+https://github.com/adimajo/lrtree.git\n```\n\nIf `git` is not installed, you can also use:\n\n```PowerShell\npipenv install --upgrade https://github.com/adimajo/lrtree/archive/master.tar.gz\n```\n\n#### Installing through the `pip` command\n\nYou can install a stable version from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lrtree/) by using:\n\n```PowerShell\npip install lrtree\n```\n\nTo run the provided scripts, `lrtree-consistency` and `lrtree-realdata`, you need a \nfew additional dependencies:\n```PowerShell\npip install lrtree[scripts]\n```\n\n#### Installation guide for Anaconda\n\nThe installation with the `pip` or `pipenv` command **should** work. If not, please raise an issue.\n\n#### For people behind proxy(ies)...\n\nA lot of people, including myself, work behind a proxy at work...\n\nA simple solution to get the package is to use the `--proxy` option of `pip`:\n\n```PowerShell\npip --proxy=http://username:password@server:port install lrtree\n```\n\nwhere *username*, *password*, *server* and *port* should be replaced by your own values.\n\nIf environment variables `http_proxy` and / or `https_proxy` and / or (unfortunately depending on applications...) \n`HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` are set, the proxy settings should be picked up by `pip`.\n\nOver the years, I've found [CNTLM](http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/) to be a great tool in this regard.\n\n## Authors\n\n* [Adrien Ehrhardt](https://adimajo.github.io)\n* [Vincent Vandewalle](https://sites.google.com/site/vvandewa/)\n* [Philippe Heinrich](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~heinrich/)\n* [Christophe Biernacki](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~biernack/)\n* Dmitri Gaynullin\n* Elise Bayraktar\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis research has been financed by [CrÃ©dit Agricole Consumer Finance](https://www.ca-consumerfinance.com/en.html) through a CIFRE PhD.\n\nThis research was supported by [Inria Lille - Nord-Europe](https://www.inria.fr/centre/lille) and [Lille University](https://www.univ-lille.fr/en/home/) as part of a PhD.\n\n## References\n\nEhrhardt, A. (2019), [Formalization and study of statistical problems in Credit Scoring: Reject inference, discretization and pairwise interactions, logistic regression trees](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02302691) ([PhD thesis](https://github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these)).\n\n## Contribute\n\nYou can clone this project using:\n\n```PowerShell\ngit clone https://github.com/adimajo/lrtree.git\n```\n\nYou can install all dependencies, including development dependencies, using (note that \nthis command requires `pipenv` which can be installed by typing `pip install pipenv`):\n\n```PowerShell\npipenv install -d\n```\n\nYou can build the documentation by going into the `docs` directory and typing `make html`.\n\nYou can run the tests by typing `coverage run -m pytest`, which relies on packages \n[coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.2/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).\n\nTo run the tests in different environments (one for each version of Python), install `pyenv` (see [the instructions here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)),\ninstall all versions you want to test (see [tox.ini](tox.ini)), e.g. with `pyenv install 3.7.0` and run \n`pipenv run pyenv local 3.7.0 [...]` (and all other versions) followed by `pipenv run tox`.\n \n## Python Environment \nThe project uses `pipenv`. [An interesting resource](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/).\n\nTo download all the project dependencies in order to then port them to a machine that had limited access to the internet, you must use the command\n`pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt` which will transform the `Pipfile` into a `requirements.txt`.\n\n## Installation\nTo install a virtual environment as well as all the necessary dependencies, you must use the `pipenv install` command for production use \nor the command `pipenv install -d` for development use.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe tests are based on `pytest` and are stored in the `tests` folder. They can all be launched with the command\n`pytest` in at the root of the project.\nThe test coverage can be calculated thanks to the `coverage` package, which is also responsible for launching the tests. \nThe command to use is `coverage run -m pytest`. We can then obtain a graphic summary in the form of an HTML page \nusing the `coverage html` command which creates or updates the `htmlcov` folder from which we can open the `index.html` file.\n\n## Utilization\nThe package provides [sklearn-like](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) interface.\n\nLoading [sample data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) for regression task:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_boston\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25)\n```\n\nThe trained model consists of a fitted `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` class for segmentation of a data and\n`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` regressions for each node a of a tree in a form of python list.\n\nThe snippet to train the model and make a prediction:\n```python\nfrom lrtree import Lrtree\n\nmodel = Lrtree(criterion=\"bic\", ratios=(0.7,), class_num=2, max_iter=100)\n\n# Fitting the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make a prediction on a fitted model\nmodel.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nIf you installed the additional dependencies for scripts, you can also run directly from the command line:\n```PowerShell\nLOGURU_LEVEL=\"ERROR\" DEBUG=\"True\" lrtree-consistency\n```\n\nor\n```PowerShell\nLOGURU_LEVEL=\"ERROR\" TQDM_DISABLE=\"1\" lrtree-realdata\n```\n\nBeware: if you don't set `LOGURU_LEVEL` then it is implicitly set on DEBUG\nwhich will yield a lot of prints. Also, both scripts will take very long\nto complete as they test the consistency of the method for various \nhyperparameters and run cross-validation on 3 real datasets respectively.\n",
