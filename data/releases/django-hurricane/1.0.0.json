It was initially developed at a time when web applications got deployed and run on a server \n(physical or virtual). With its *pragmatic design* it enabled many developers to keep up with changing requirements, \nperformance and maintenance work.  \nHowever, service architectures have become quite popular for complex applications in the past few years. They provide\na modular style based on the philosophy of dividing overwhelming software projects into smaller and more controllable \nparts. The advantage of highly specialized applications gained prominence among developers, but introduces new \nchallenges to the IT-operation.   \nHowever, with the advent of Kubernetes and the cloud-native development philosophy a couple of new possibilities emerged\nto run those service-based applications even better. Kubernetes is a wonderful answer for just as many IT-operation \nrequirements as Django is for web development. The inherent monolithic design of Django can be tempting to roll out \nrecurring operation patterns with each application. It's not about getting Django to run in a \nKubernetes cluster (you may already solved this), it's about integrating Django as tightly as possible with Kubernetes \nin order to harness the full power of that platform. Creating the most robust, scalable and secure applications \nwith Django by leveraging the existing expertise of our favorite framework is the main goal of this initiative.\n\nHurricane is supposed to make the most out of the existing Django ecosystem without reinventing the wheel. \nWe will collect best-practices and opinions about how to run Django in Kubernetes and put them on Hurricane's roadmap.\n\n### Application Server\nWhy another app server instead of *uwsgi*, *gunicorn* or *mod_wsgi*? We need a cloud-native app server which is\nmuch more tidily coupled to the Django application itself. Think of special url routes for Kubernetes probes! Building a\nspecial View in each and every Django application is not an appropriate solution. What about the Kubernetes Metrics API?\nThat's all something we **don't** want to take care of in our Django code.  \nThose traditional app servers (i.e. uwsgi et.al.) have a highly optimized process model for bare-server deployments with\nmany CPUs, multiple threads and so on. In Kubernetes the scaling of an application is done through the Replication-value\nin a workload description manifest. This is no longer something we configure with app server parameters.\n  \n## Installation\n\nHurricane can be installed from a Python Package Index:\n```bash\npip3 install hurricane\n```\n\nAdd *\"hurricane\"* to your *INSTALLED_APPS*: \n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS += (\n    'hurricane',\n)\n```\n\nCheck out the [documentation](https://django-hurricane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information and a user's guide.\n\n## Commercial Support\nHurricane is developed and maintained by [Blueshoe](https://www.blueshoe.de). \nIf you need any help implementing with hurricane, please contact us: hurricane@blueshoe.de.\n\n",
