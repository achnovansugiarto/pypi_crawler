You can still use this package to help simulate \"online judge\", which is not the goal of this work.\n\n## Workflow\n\n![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aben20807/local-judge/master/images/workflow.png)<!--https://app.diagrams.net/#G1sHhxLAY34FpYWBGIHJirRF19tevzqwi0-->\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aben20807/local-judge/master/images/screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n+ For global usage:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install local-judge\n  ```\n\n+ With virtualenv:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ virtualenv -p python3.6 venv\n  $ source venv/bin/activate\n  $ pip install local-judge\n  ```\n\n## Features\n\n+ Both\n  + Automatically build the source code into executable\n  + Automatically run the executable for each input and compare output with answer\n  + Customization friendly\n  + Able to leverage git diff tool to compare the result with the answer\n+ Student (`judge`)\n  + Without any dependencies but standard build-in python packages\n+ TA (`ta_judge`)\n  + Two dependencies packages: `openpyxl`, `rarfile`\n  + Support different zip type (`.zip`, `.rar`)\n  + When error is occurred, not interrupt or exit but just log it \n  + Output to excel table\n  + Multiprocessing\n\n## Environment (Recommended)\n\n+ Ubuntu 18.04\n+ python 3.6\n+ git 2.17.1 (Our default diff tool for comparing between output and answer is git. Please make sure that you have installed it.)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n+ [judge](https://github.com/aben20807/local-judge/tree/master/examples/judge/)\n+ [ta_judge](https://github.com/aben20807/local-judge/tree/master/examples/ta_judge/)\n\n## Documentation of Configuration\n### judge\n\n+ `judge.conf`: be placed in the root of your program [[example]](https://github.com/aben20807/local-judge/tree/master/examples/judge/wrong/judge.conf)\n  + `BuildCommand`: how to build the executable\n  + `Executable`: the name of the executable\n  + `RunCommand`: how to run the executable with input and output\n  + `Inputs`: input files (can use wildcard)\n  + `TempOutputDir`: the temporary directory to place output files\n  + `DiffCommand`: how to find differences between output and answer\n  + `DeleteTempOutput`: whether to delete the temporary output after finding the differences (true or false)\n  + `AnswerDir`: the directory where contains the answer files corresponding to the input files\n  + `AnswerExtension`: the extension of the answer files\n  + `ExitOrLog`: exit when any error occurred or just log the error\n  + `ScoreDict`: the dictionary for the mapping of correctness and score\n  + `TotalScore`: used if the number of tests is more than `ScoreDict`\n  + `Timeout`: execution timeout for each test case\n\n### ta_judge\n\n+ `ta_judge.config`: [[example]](https://github.com/aben20807/local-judge/tree/master/examples/ta_judge/ta_judge.conf)\n  + First part is `judge.conf`\n  + `StudentList`: the execl file which contains student name and id\n  + `StudentsZipContainer`: the directory where contains students' submit homeworks\n  + `StudentsPattern`: used to match zip files\n  + `UpdateStudentPattern`: used for update score of single student\n  + `StudentsExtractDir`: the directory where contains extracted homeworks\n  + `ScoreOutput`: the output excel file\n  + `ExtractAfresh`: true: re-extract zipped file for each judge time; false: use pre-extracted files (under `StudentsExtractDir`) to judge\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease make sure that you have installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting the code with the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) style.\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n$ virtualenv -p python3.7 venv3.7\n$ source venv3.7/bin/activate\n$ python setup.py develop\n$ pip install -e .\n$ pip list\nPackage            Version Location\n------------------ ------- ---------------------------------\nblack              21.12b0\nclick              8.0.3\net-xmlfile         1.1.0\nimportlib-metadata 4.10.0\nlocal-judge        2.4.7   /home/ben/pro/selfpro/local-judge\nmypy-extensions    0.4.3\nopenpyxl           3.0.9\npathspec           0.9.0\npip                21.0.1\nplatformdirs       2.4.1\nrarfile            4.0\nsetuptools         54.1.1\ntomli              1.2.3\ntyped-ast          1.5.1\ntyping-extensions  4.0.1\nwheel              0.36.2\nzipp               3.6.0\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n",
