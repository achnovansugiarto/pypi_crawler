Each player in one set has a\nranked preference list of those in the other, and the objective is to find some\nmapping between the two sets such that no pair of players are unhappy. The\ncontext of the terms \"mapping\" and \"unhappy\" are dependent on the framework of\nthe particular game being played but are largely to do with the stability of the\npairings.\n\nIn ``matching``, we deal with four types of matching game:\n\n- the stable marriage problem (SM);\n- the hospital-resident assignment problem (HR);\n- the student-allocation problem (SA);\n- the stable roommates problem (SR).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMatching is written in Python 3, and relies only on `NumPy\n<http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for general use.\n\nThe library is most easily installed using :code:`pip`::\n\n    $ python -m pip install matching\n\nHowever, if you would like to install it from source then go ahead and clone the\nGitHub repo::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching.git\n    $ cd matching\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nUsing the ``Player`` class\n--------------------------\n\nWith all of these games, ``matching`` uses a ``Player`` class to represent the\nmembers of the \"applying\" party, i.e. residents and students. For HR and SA,\nthere are specific classes to represent the roles of ``Hospital``, ``Project``\nand ``Supervisor``.\n\nFor instances of SM, we require two lists of ``Player`` instances -- one for\neach party detailing their preferences.\n\nConsider the following problem which is represented on a bipartite graph.\n\n.. image:: ./img/stable_marriage.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 10cm\n\nWe construct the players in this game in the following way:\n\n>>> from matching import Player\n\n>>> suitors = [Player(name=\"A\"), Player(name=\"B\"), Player(name=\"C\")]\n>>> reviewers = [Player(name=\"D\"), Player(name=\"E\"), Player(name=\"F\")]\n>>> (A, B, C), (D, E, F) = suitors, reviewers\n\n>>> A.set_prefs([D, E, F])\n>>> B.set_prefs([D, F, E])\n>>> C.set_prefs([F, D, E])\n\n>>> D.set_prefs([B, C, A])\n>>> E.set_prefs([A, C, B])\n>>> F.set_prefs([C, B, A])\n\nThen to solve this matching game, we make use of the ``StableMarriage`` class,\nlike so:\n\n>>> from matching.games import StableMarriage\n>>> game = StableMarriage(suitors, reviewers)\n>>> game.solve()\n{A: E, B: D, C: F}\n\n\nNote\n++++\n\nThis matching is not a standard Python dictionary, though it does largely look\nand behave like one. It is in fact an instance of the ``Matching`` class:\n\n>>> matching = game.matching\n>>> type(matching)\n<class 'matching.matching.Matching'>\n\nThis dictionary-like object is primarily useful as a teaching device that eases\nthe process of manipulating a matching after a solution has been found. \n\n\nUsing dictionaries\n------------------\n\nFor larger game instances, creating players directly (as above) could be\nunreasonably tedious. An alternative approach is to create an instance of a game\nfrom Python dictionaries. For example, consider the following instance of HR:\n\nThere are five residents -- Ada, Sam, Jo, Luc, Dani -- applying to work at three\nhospitals: Mercy, City, General. Each hospital has two available positions, and\nthe players' preferences of one another are as follows:\n\n.. image:: ./img/hospital_resident.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 10cm\n\nThis information can be conveyed as a few dictionaries like so:\n\n>>> resident_prefs = {\n...     \"A\": [\"C\"],\n...     \"S\": [\"C\", \"M\"],\n...     \"D\": [\"C\", \"M\", \"G\"],\n...     \"J\": [\"C\", \"G\", \"M\"],\n...     \"L\": [\"M\", \"C\", \"G\"],\n... }\n>>> hospital_prefs = {\n...     \"M\": [\"D\", \"L\", \"S\", \"J\"],\n...     \"C\": [\"D\", \"A\", \"S\", \"L\", \"J\"],\n...     \"G\": [\"D\", \"J\", \"L\"],\n... }\n>>> capacities = {hosp: 2 for hosp in hospital_prefs}\n\nThen, similarly, this game is solved using the ``HospitalResident`` class but an\ninstance is created using the ``create_from_dictionaries`` class method:\n\n>>> from matching.games import HospitalResident\n>>> game = HospitalResident.create_from_dictionaries(\n...     resident_prefs, hospital_prefs, capacities\n... )\n>>> game.solve()\n{M: [L, S], C: [D, A], G: [J]}\n\nNote\n++++\n\nDespite passing dictionaries of strings here, the matching displays instances of\n``matching`` players:\n\n>>> matching = game.matching\n>>> for hospital in matching:\n...     print(type(hospital))\n<class 'matching.players.hospital.Hospital'>\n<class 'matching.players.hospital.Hospital'>\n<class 'matching.players.hospital.Hospital'>\n\nThis is because ``create_from_dictionaries`` creates instances of the\nappropriate player classes first and passes them to the game class. Using\ndictionaries like this can be an efficient way of creating large games but it\ndoes require the names of the players in each party to be unique.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFull documentation is available here: `<https://matching.readthedocs.io>`_\n\n\nA note on performance\n---------------------\n\nOne of the limitations of this library is the time complexities of the algorithm\nimplementations. In practical terms, the running time of any of the algorithms\nin Matching is negligible but the theoretic complexity of each has not yet been\nattained. For example, an instance of HR with 400 applicants and 20 hospitals is\nsolved in less than one tenth of a second:\n\n>>> from matching.games import HospitalResident\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> np.random.seed(0)\n>>> resident_prefs = {\n...     r: np.argsort(np.random.random(size=20)) for r in range(400)\n... }\n>>> hospital_prefs = {\n...     h: np.argsort(np.random.random(size=400)) for h in range(20)\n... }\n>>> capacities = {h: 20 for h in hospital_prefs}\n>>> game = HospitalResident.create_from_dictionaries(\n...     resident_prefs, hospital_prefs, capacities\n... )\n>>> _ = game.solve() # 48.6 ms ± 963 µs per loop\n\n\nGet in contact!\n---------------\n\nI hope this package is useful, and feel free to contact me here (or on Twitter:\n`@daffidwilde <https://twitter.com/daffidwilde>`_) with any issues or\nrecommendations.
