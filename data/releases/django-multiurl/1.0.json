    "description": "django-multiurl\n===============\n\nHave you ever wanted multiple views to match to the same URL? Now you can.\n\nYou may once have tried something like this::\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.people),\n        url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.place),\n    )\n\nHowever, if you try this, ``/app/san-francisco/`` will only map to\n``app.views.people``. Raising an ``Http404`` from ``app.views.people`` doesn't\nhelp: you only get a 404 in the browser because Django stops resolving\nURLs at the first match.\n\nWell, ``django-multiurl`` solves this problem. Just ``pip install django-\nmultiurl``, then do this::\n\n    from multiurl import multiurl\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        multiurl(\n            url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.people),\n            url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.place),\n        )\n    )\n\nNow in your views, raise ``multiurl.ContinueResolving`` anywhere you'd like\nto break out of the view and keep resolving. For example, here's what\n``app.views.people`` might look like::\n\n    from multiurl import ContinueResolving\n\n    def people(request, name):\n        try:\n            person = Person.objects.get(name=name)\n        except Person.DoesNotExist:\n            raise ContinueResolving\n        return render(...)\n\nThat's it! ``ContinueResolving`` will cause ``multiurl`` to continue onto the\nnext view (``app.views.place``, in this example).\n\nA few notes to round things out:\n\n* If you don't want to use ``ContinueResolving`` -- perhaps you'd rather\n  continue using ``get_object_or_404``, or you're using third-party views\n  that you can't modify to raise ``ContinueResolving``, you can pass a\n  ``catch`` argument into ``multiurl`` to control which exceptions are\n  considered \"continue\" statements. For example, to allow ``Http404``\n  exceptions to continue resolving, do this::\n\n        urlpatterns = patterns('',\n            multiurl(\n                url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.people),\n                url('/app/(\\w+)/$', app.views.place),\n                catch = (Http404, ContinueResolving)\n            )\n        )\n\n  As you can see, ``catch`` should be a tuple of exceptions. It's probably a\n  good idea to always include ``ContinueResolving`` in the tuple.\n\n* If the last view in a ``multiurl`` raises ``ContinueResolving`` (or another\n  \"continuing\" exception), a 404 will be raised instead. That is, if resolving\n  \"falls off the end\" of some multi-urls, you'll get the 404 you expect.\n\n* Reverse URL resolution just works as expected. Name your sub-URLs and then\n  reverse your heart out.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nDevelopment takes place\n`on GitHub <http://github.com/jacobian/django-multiurl>`_; pull requests are\nwelcome.
