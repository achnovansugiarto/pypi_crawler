    "description": "## Meteor Diceware \nA low-resource, easy to use, low latency, customizable and cryptographically secure implementation of [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) which uses a single database which can populate millions of entries for possible words and can easily generate cryptographically strong and secure passwords which one can easily remember. \n\n#### Installation \n\nThe package has not yet been uploaded to PyPI, and hence needs to be built from source. \n\n```\ngit clone  https://gitlab.com/loggerheads-with-binary/meteor_diceware.git \ncd meteor-diceware \npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt \npython3 setup.py install \n```\n\n**Note: The utility already comes with the original diceware list as the wordlist `main`. Other wordlists can be inserted manually through files or via the command line** \n\n#### Use cases \n\nIt's always advised to use >= 5 words for the password as well as to use >=2 special characters. To establish the same, one can do the following:\n\nEx: \n```\n$ python3 -m meteor_diceware -n 5 -d \"_\" -s 2 \n> For_2Says_For_Ch8aracters_Is  \n```\n\nNOTE :: Please do not use diceware and then make obvious substituions like changing SANA to $^N^. It has been proven time and again that **addition**, not substitution is what makes a password more cryptographically secure. As in `MALO0NE` is more secure than `MAL0NE`\n\n#### Using utils \n\n`meteor_diceware.utils` is a bundled accessory which helps generate, edit, delete, concatenate, backup and maintain wordlists. \n\nThe following actions can be performed via the utils command-line:\n\n1. `python3 -m meteor_diceware.utils create <wordlistname> -w <word1> <word2>... -f <text file to pull words from>` : As obvious this generates a new wordlist by the name `<wordlistname>`\n2. `utils edit <wordlistname> -w <word1> <word2> ... -f <file>` : It adds words to an existing database \n*Note: Check more on using the snowflake flag in the file snowflake.pdf* \n3. `utils show <wordlistname>` : Shows summary and content information of the wordlist \n4. `utils freeze <wordlistname> -o <file>` : Outputs all the words from the wordlist in the text file `<file>`\n5. `utils rm <wordlist1> <wordlist2> ...` : Remove one or more wordlists from the database\n6. `utils ls` : Lists all the existing wordlists from the database\n7. `utils cp <wordlist> -t <target>` : Copies wordlist to target within the database. Can be used as a backup of some sort\n8. `utils cat <wordlist1> <wordlist2> .... -t <target>` : Concatenates files from all the different wordlists to the target wordlist\n9. `utils recount <wordlist1> <wordlist2> ...` : Rebases and reindexes the wordlists. This counter/index is used internally within the program and is not exposed to the user.\n10. `utils backup <wordlist1> <wordlist2> ... -o <file>` : Creates a copy of the wordlists into a separate SQLite Database file `<file>`\n11. `utils restore <file> -W <wordlist1> <wordlist2> --replace` : Restores wordlists from a separate file to the main database \n12. `utils histogram <wordlist> --graphic/--tabular/--output <file>` : Creates a length histogram of the words in the wordlist and presents in both tabular and graphic form. Can also be exported to `.csv` format if -o flag is used.\n13. `utils scrape <wordlist> --links <link1> <link2> ... ` : Scrape the links and add the words to the wordlist. Use `--responsive` flag for responsive pages and use selenium. \n\n#### Credits \n\nThe following [Diceware Words List](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt) has been used as-is to create the main wordlist of the program. \n\n#### Bugs \n\nAny bugs or cryptographic suggestions can be sent to [dev@aniruddh.ml](mailto:dev@aniruddh.ml)  \n",
