    "description": "# grader\nAutomatic grading for DLAI courses. Designed to be compatible with Coursera's grading requirements.\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo use this library you will need to have Python, Docker and [coursera-autograder](https://github.com/coursera/coursera_autograder) installed in your pc.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can use pip to install it!\n```bash\npip install dlai_grader\n```\n\n\n# How to use it\n\n## Initialize a grader\n\nTo start building your grader `cd` into the directory where you will be working and use the following command:\n\n```bash\ndlai_grader --init\n```\n\nThis will ask you for:\n- Name of the course (abbreviation is recommended)\n- Number of the course\n- Number of the week\n- Version of the grader (defaults to 1 but can be 2 or any other number)\n\nThis will generate a file system tree like this:\n\n```\n.\n└── grader (directory you invoked the command from)\n    ├── data/               -> To store datasets (csv, TF Datasets, etc).\n    ├── learner/            -> The learner facing version will be generated here.\n    ├── solution/           -> Place solution.ipynb here\n    ├── submission/         -> Necessary only in debug mode (no need to place anything here).\n    ├── mount/              -> This mocks the bind mount that coursera will attach to the container. Should contain submission.ipynb or other file required for grading.\n    ├── .conf               -> Configuration variables.\n    ├── Dockerfile          -> Uses frolvlad/alpine-miniconda3:python3.7 as base image.\n    ├── Makefile            -> Useful commands.\n    ├── requirements.txt    -> Python dependencies.\n    ├── entry.py            -> Entrypoint of the grader.\n    └── grader.py           -> Grading logic.\n```\n\n## Placing the solution and submission\n\nNow that you have the layout of the grader you will need to place the solution of the assignment within the `solution/` directory. **This file must be named `solution.ipynb`**.\n\nA good starting point is to use the solution to create the first iteration of the grader. To do this place the solution within the `mount/` directory and **rename it to `submission.ipynb`**. You can use the `make submit-solution` command to do this.\n\nYour filesystem tree should look like this:\n\n```\n.\n└── grader\n    ├── ... \n    ├── solution/\n    │    └── solution.ipynb\n    ├── mount/ \n    │    └── submission.ipynb\n    └── ...\n```\n\nNote that the grader can be used to grade files other than Jupyter notebooks. If this is the case you can leave the `solution/` directory empty and place the file to grade within `mount/`. This file can be anything (`.h5, .tar.gz, .zip, etc`) the only requirement is that it should match the name of the file to submit in the coursera programming item.\n\n# Add versioning to the notebook\n\n## Why is this useful?\n\nWe have seen many learners facing issues when submitting their assignments because coursera does not show them the latest version. To address this, a good alternative it to always check that the submission of the learner is up to date and if not, tell them how they can upgrade to the latest version.\n\nTo ensure that a submission is compatible with a particular version of the grader the versioning feature has been created.\n\nWithin the `.conf` file you will find the current version of the grader under the variable `GRADER_VERSION`.\n\nTo compare against this version the submission notebook must include a variable called `grader_version` in its metadata. To add this variable to the `submission.ipynb` file you can use the `make versioning` command (this is just a wrapper of the `dlai_grader --versioning` command). This will add the variable matching the same version as the one found in the `.conf` file.\n\n\n## Upgrading the grader and notebook version\n\nAfter a refactor with breaking changes to the grader it is a good idea to upgrade the version to a newer one. You can do this be using the `make upgrade` command. This will add 1 to the current version in the `.conf` file and in the notebook.\n\n# Tagging graded cells\n\nYou might decide to filter out cells created by learners (or other ones such as the ones that train models). If you take this approach you can add a tag to each cell's metadata and then filter out the ones that don't have this tag .\n\nIf you wish to add the `graded` tag to each cell in the `submission.ipynb` notebook you can use the `make tag` command. \n\n# Important note for make commands\n\nNote that the `make tag`, `make upgrade` and `make versioning` commands change only the `mount/submission.ipynb` file. \n\n\n# Adding Python dependencies\n\nThe next step is to include all the necessary Python dependencies. For this add them to the `requirements.txt` file. By default only `dlai_grader` is included.\n\n# Building the grading\n\nNotice that two blank Python files were created during the `init` step. These are `grader.py` and `entry.py`. It might be odd to have two separate files if ony could do the trick. \n\nHowever it is usually best to separate the grading logic from the entrypoint of the application, as the names suggest, these should be placed within `grader.py` and `entry.py`, respectively.\n\n\n# Building the Docker image\n\nEvery time you make changes to any file that the grader is dependant-on, you should rebuild the Docker image used for grading. You can do this by using the `make build` command.\n\n# Grading\n\nTo grade, simply use the `make grade` command. This will spin up the coursera-autograder tool to simulate Coursera's grading environment.\n\n# Debugging\n\nSome times when using this command you will be presented with a not so descriptive error by coursera-autograder such as \"Problem when running command. Sorry!\". This happens because this tool does not transparently exposes the errors.\n\nWhen you face this error you can enter debug mode by using the `make debug` command. This will spin up a container using the image you created and configuring it in the same way as coursera-autograder would. \n\nWithin the container you have a command line where you can test your code directly. To do this, export the partid you are currently working on as an environment variable.  `export partId=XxXx` will do the trick. And then use the entrypoint of the application by running `python entry.py`.\n\nBy doing this you can actually see the error messages that are being generated and another nice feature of this mode is that you don't need to rebuild the image, you can simply edit `grading.py` and run `python entry.py` to try out the grader.\n\n# Building by Example\n\nTo better ilustrate how to use the library, an example will be used. The [assignment](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public/blob/main/C1/W1/assignment/C1W1_Assignment.ipynb) for the first week of the first course of the Tensorflow 1 specialization will be used.\n\nTrimming the markdown and including the solution, the assignment looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\n# GRADED FUNCTION: house_model\ndef house_model():\n    ### START CODE HERE\n    \n    # Define input and output tensors with the values for houses with 1 up to 6 bedrooms\n    # Hint: Remember to explictly set the dtype as float\n    xs = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=float)\n    ys = np.array([1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5], dtype=float)\n    \n    # Define your model (should be a model with 1 dense layer and 1 unit)\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])\n    \n    # Compile your model\n    # Set the optimizer to Stochastic Gradient Descent\n    # and use Mean Squared Error as the loss function\n    model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error') # @REPLACE model.compile(optimizer=None, loss=None)\n    \n    # Train your model for 1000 epochs by feeding the i/o tensors\n    model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=1000) # @REPLACE model.fit(None, None, epochs=None)\n    \n    ### END CODE HERE\n    return model\n\n# Get your trained model\nmodel = house_model()\n\nnew_y = 7.0\nprediction = model.predict([new_y])[0]\nprint(prediction)\n```\n\n## Download the assignment\n\n\n\n",
