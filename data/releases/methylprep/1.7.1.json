The `methylprep` package contains functions for processing raw data files from arrays and downloading/processing public data sets from GEO (the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus database repository), or from ArrayExpress. It contains both a command line interface (CLI) for processing data from local files, and a set of functions for building a custom pipeline in a jupyter notebook or python scripting environment. The aim is to offer a standard process, with flexibility for those who want it.\n\n`methylprep` data processing has also been tested and benchmarked to match the outputs of two popular R packages: [sesame](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sesame.html) (v1.10.4) and [minfi](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/minfi.html) (v1.38).\n\n## Methylsuite package components\n\nYou should install all three components, as they work together. The parts include:\n\n- `methylprep`: (this package) for processing `idat` files or downloading GEO datasets from NIH. Processing steps include\n   - infer type-I channel switch\n   - NOOB (normal-exponential convolution on out-of-band probe data)\n   - poobah (p-value with out-of-band array hybridization, for filtering lose signal-to-noise probes)\n   - qualityMask (to exclude historically less reliable probes)\n   - nonlinear dye bias correction (AKA signal quantile normalization between red/green channels across a sample)\n   - calculate beta-value, m-value, or copy-number matrix\n   - large batch memory management, by splitting it up into smaller batches during processing\n\n- `methylcheck`: for quality control (QC) and analysis, including\n   - functions for filtering out unreliable probes, based on the published literature\n      - Note that `methylprep process` will exclude a set of unreliable probes by default. You can disable that using the --no_quality_mask option from CLI.\n   - sample outlier detection\n   - array level QC plots, based on Genome Studio functions\n   - a python clone of Illumina's Bead Array Controls Reporter software (QC)\n   - data visualization functions based on `seaborn` and `matplotlib` graphic libraries.\n   - predict sex of human samples from probes\n   - interactive method for assigning samples to groups, based on array data, in a Jupyter notebook\n\n- `methylize` provides more analysis and interpretation functions\n   - differentially methylated probe statistics (between treatment and control samples)\n   - volcano plots (which probes are the most different?)\n   - manhattan plots (where in genome are the differences?)\n\n## Installation\n\n`methylprep` maintains configuration files for your Python package manager of choice: [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). Conda install is coming soon.\n\n```shell\n>>> pip install methylprep\n```\n\nor if you want to install all three packages at once:\n```shell\n>>> pip install methylsuite\n```\n\n## Tutorials and Guides\nIf you're new to DNA methylation analysis, we recommend reading through [this introduction](docs/introduction/introduction.md) in order get the background knowledge needed to best utilize `methylprep` effectively. Otherwise, you're ready to use `methylprep` for:\n<br>\n\n- processing [your own methylation data](docs/general_walkthrough.md#processing-your-own-data)\n- downloading [unprocessed data](docs/general_walkthrough.md#downloading-from-geo) (like IDAT files) from GEO.\n- downloading [preprocessed data](docs/special_cases.md#using-beta-bake-for-preprocessed-data) (like beta values) from GEO.\n- building a composite dataset [using control samples](docs/special_cases.md#building-a-composite-dataset-using-meta-data) from GEO.\n- building a composite dataset from GEO data [with any keyword you choose](docs/special_cases.md#building-a-composite-dataset-with-alert-and-composite) (e.g. combining all GEO datasets that have methylation data from patients with brain cancer).\n\n<!-- Add link to methods paper when available -->\n\n\n",
