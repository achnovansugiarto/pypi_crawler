To\r\naddress the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we present a\r\nnovel algorithm, named Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for\r\nidentifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures the\r\ninfluence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of\r\nenriched ChIP regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of\r\nbinding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag\r\nposition and orientation. MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data\r\nalone, or with control sample with the increase of specificity.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPlease check the file 'INSTALL' in the distribution.\r\n\r\nDesign of MACS2\r\n===============\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\nUsage of MACS2\r\n==============\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n  macs2 [-h] [--version]\r\n             {callpeak,filterdup,bdgpeakcall,bdgcmp,randsample,bdgdiff,bdgbroadcall}\r\n\r\n:Example for regular peak calling: ``macs2 callpeak -t ChIP.bam -c Control.bam -f BAM -g hs -n test -B -q 0.01``\r\n\r\n:Example for broad peak calling: ``macs2 -t ChIP.bam -c Control.bam --broad -g hs``\r\n\r\nThere are seven major functions available in MACS serving as sub-commands.\r\n\r\n:callpeak:            Main MACS2 Function to `Call peaks`_ from alignment results.\r\n:bdgpeakcall:         Call peaks from bedGraph output.\r\n:bdgbroadcall:        Call broad peaks from bedGraph output.\r\n:bdgcmp:              Deduct noise by comparing two signal tracks in bedGraph.\r\n:bdgdiff:             Differential peak detection based on paired four bedgraph files.\r\n:diffpeak:            Another differential peak detection based on paired four bedgraph files, with more statistics.\r\n:filterdup:           Remove duplicate reads at the same position, then convert acceptable format to BED format.\r\n:predictd:            Predict d or fragment size from alignment results.\r\n:pileup:              Pileup aligned reads with a given extension\r\n                      size (fragment size or d in MACS language). Note there will be no\r\n                      step for duplicate reads filtering or sequencing depth scaling, so you may need to do certain post-\r\n                      processing.\r\n:randsample:          Randomly sample number/percentage of total reads.\r\n:refinepeak:          (Experimental) Take raw reads alignment, refine peak\r\n                          summits and give scores measuring balance of forward-\r\n                          backward tags. Inspired by SPP.\r\n\r\nCall peaks\r\n~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThis is the main function in MACS2. It can be invoked by 'macs2\r\ncallpeak' command. If you type this command without parameters, you\r\nwill see a full description of commandline options.\r\n\r\nParameters\r\n----------\r\n\r\n-t/--treatment FILENAME\r\n```````````````````````\r\n\r\nThis is the only REQUIRED parameter for MACS. File can be in any\r\nsupported format specified by --format option. Check --format for\r\ndetail. If you have more than one alignment files, you can supply\r\nthem as ```-t A B C```. MACS will pool up all these files together.\r\n\r\n- -c/--control\r\n\r\nThe control or mock data file. Please follow the same direction as for\r\n-t/--treatment.\r\n\r\n- -n/--name\r\n\r\nThe name string of the experiment. MACS will use this string NAME to\r\ncreate output files like 'NAME_peaks.xls', 'NAME_negative_peaks.xls',\r\n'NAME_peaks.bed' , 'NAME_summits.bed', 'NAME_model.r' and so on. So\r\nplease avoid any confliction between these filenames and your\r\nexisting files.\r\n\r\n- -f/--format FORMAT\r\n\r\nFormat of tag file, can be \"ELAND\", \"BED\", \"ELANDMULTI\",\r\n\"ELANDEXPORT\", \"ELANDMULTIPET\" (for pair-end tags), \"SAM\", \"BAM\" or\r\n\"BOWTIE\". Default is \"AUTO\" which will allow MACS to decide the\r\nformat automatically. Please use \"AUTO\" only when you combine\r\ndifferent formats of files.\r\n\r\nThe BED format can be found at `UCSC genome browser website <http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1>`_.\r\n\r\nIf the format is ELAND, the file must be ELAND result output file,\r\neach line MUST represents only ONE tag, with fields of:\r\n\r\n 1. Sequence name (derived from file name and line number if format is not Fasta)\r\n 2. Sequence\r\n 3. Type of match:\r\n\r\n    :NM: no match found.\r\n    :QC: no matching done: QC failure (too many Ns basically).\r\n    :RM: no matching done: repeat masked (may be seen if repeatFile.txt was specified).\r\n    :U0: Best match found was a unique exact match.\r\n    :U1: Best match found was a unique 1-error match. \r\n    :U2: Best match found was a unique 2-error match. \r\n    :R0: Multiple exact matches found.\r\n    :R1: Multiple 1-error matches found, no exact matches.\r\n    :R2: Multiple 2-error matches found, no exact or 1-error matches.\r\n\r\n 4. Number of exact matches found.\r\n 5. Number of 1-error matches found.\r\n 6. Number of 2-error matches found.  \r\n    Rest of fields are only seen if a unique best match was found\r\n    (i.e. the match code in field 3 begins with \"U\").\r\n 7. Genome file in which match was found.\r\n 8. Position of match (bases in file are numbered starting at 1).\r\n 9. Direction of match (F=forward strand, R=reverse).\r\n 10. How N characters in read were interpreted: (\".\"=not applicable,\r\n     \"D\"=deletion, \"I\"=insertion). Rest of fields are only seen in\r\n     the case of a unique inexact match (i.e. the match code was U1 or\r\n     U2).\r\n 11. Position and type of first substitution error (e.g. 12A: base 12\r\n     was A, not whatever is was in read).\r\n 12. Position and type of first substitution error, as above. \r\n\r\nIf the format is ELANDMULTI, the file must be ELAND output file from\r\nmultiple-match mode, each line MUST represents only ONE tag, with\r\nfields of:\r\n\r\n 1. Sequence name \r\n 2. Sequence \r\n 3. Either NM, QC, RM (as described above) or the following: \r\n 4. x:y:z where x, y, and z are the number of exact, single-error, and 2-error matches found\r\n 5. Blank, if no matches found or if too many matches found, or the following:\r\n    BAC_plus_vector.fa:163022R1,170128F2,E_coli.fa:3909847R1 This says\r\n    there are two matches to BAC_plus_vector.fa: one in the reverse\r\n    direction starting at position 160322 with one error, one in the\r\n    forward direction starting at position 170128 with two\r\n    errors. There is also a single-error match to E_coli.fa.\r\n\r\nIf the format is BAM/SAM, please check the definition in\r\n(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml).  Pair-end mapping\r\nresults can be saved in a single BAM file, if so, MACS will\r\nautomatically keep the left mate(5' end) tag. However, when format\r\nBAMPET is specified, MACS will use the real fragments inferred from\r\nalignment results for reads pileup.\r\n\r\nIf the format is BOWTIE, you need to provide the ASCII bowtie output\r\nfile with the suffix '.map'. Please note that, you need to make sure\r\nthat in the bowtie output, you only keep one location for one\r\nread. Check the bowtie manual for detail if you want at\r\n(http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml)\r\n\r\nHere is the definition for Bowtie output in ASCII characters I copied\r\nfrom the above webpage:\r\n\r\n 1. Name of read that aligned\r\n 2. Orientation of read in the alignment, '-' for reverse complement, '+'\r\n    otherwise\r\n 3. Name of reference sequence where alignment occurs, or ordinal ID\r\n    if no name was provided\r\n 4. 0-based offset into the forward reference strand where leftmost\r\n    character of the alignment occurs\r\n 5. Read sequence (reverse-complemented if orientation is -)\r\n 6. ASCII-encoded read qualities (reversed if orientation is -). The\r\n    encoded quality values are on the Phred scale and the encoding is\r\n    ASCII-offset by 33 (ASCII char !).\r\n 7. Number of other instances where the same read aligns against the\r\n    same reference characters as were aligned against in this\r\n    alignment. This is not the number of other places the read aligns\r\n    with the same number of mismatches. The number in this column is\r\n    generally not a good proxy for that number (e.g., the number in\r\n    this column may be '0' while the number of other alignments with\r\n    the same number of mismatches might be large). This column was\r\n    previously described as \"Reserved\".\r\n 8. Comma-separated list of mismatch descriptors. If there are no\r\n    mismatches in the alignment, this field is empty. A single\r\n    descriptor has the format offset:reference-base>read-base. The\r\n    offset is expressed as a 0-based offset from the high-quality (5')\r\n    end of the read.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1) For BED format, the 6th column of strand information is required by\r\nMACS. And please pay attention that the coordinates in BED format is\r\nzero-based and half-open\r\n(http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQtracks#tracks1).\r\n\r\n2) For plain ELAND format, only matches with match type U0, U1 or U2\r\nis accepted by MACS, i.e. only the unique match for a sequence with\r\nless than 3 errors is involed in calculation. If multiple hits of a\r\nsingle tag are included in your raw ELAND file, please remove the\r\nredundancy to keep the best hit for that sequencing tag.\r\n\r\n3) For the experiment with several replicates, it is recommended to\r\nconcatenate several ChIP-seq treatment files into a single file. To\r\ndo this, under Unix/Mac or Cygwin (for windows OS), type:\r\n\r\n```$ cat replicate1.bed replicate2.bed replicate3.bed > all_replicates.bed```\r\n\r\nFor BAM or SAM files, samtools can be used to combine replicates.\r\n\r\n4) ELAND export format support sometimes may not work on your\r\ndatasets, because people may mislabel the 11th and 12th column. MACS\r\nuses 11th column as the sequence name which should be the chromosome\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n- -g/--gsize\r\n\r\nPLEASE assign this parameter to fit your needs!\r\n\r\nIt's the mappable genome size or effective genome size which is\r\ndefined as the genome size which can be sequenced. Because of the\r\nrepetitive features on the chromsomes, the actual mappable genome size\r\nwill be smaller than the original size, about 90% or 70% of the genome\r\nsize. The default hs -- 2.7e9 is recommended for UCSC human hg18\r\nassembly. Here are all precompiled parameters for effective genome\r\nsize:\r\n\r\n :hs: 2.7e9\r\n :mm: 1.87e9\r\n :ce: 9e7\r\n :dm: 1.2e8\r\n\r\n- -s/--tsize\r\n\r\n The size of sequencing tags. If you don't specify it, MACS will try\r\n to use the first 10 sequences from your input treatment file to\r\n determine the tag size. Specifying it will override the automatic\r\n determined tag size.\r\n\r\n- --bw\r\n\r\n The band width which is used to scan the genome ONLY for model\r\n building. You can set this parameter as the sonication fragment size\r\n expected from wet experiment. The previous side effect on the peak\r\n detection process has been removed. So this parameter only affects\r\n the model building.\r\n\r\n- -q/--qvalue\r\n\r\n The qvalue (minimum FDR) cutoff to call significant regions. Default\r\n is 0.01. For broad marks, you can try 0.05 as cutoff. Q-values are\r\n calculated from p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.\r\n\r\n- -p/--pvalue\r\n\r\n The pvalue cutoff. If -p is specified, MACS2 will use pvalue instead\r\n of qvalue.\r\n\r\n- -m/--mfold\r\n\r\n This parameter is used to select the regions within MFOLD range of\r\n high-confidence enrichment ratio against background to build\r\n model. The regions must be lower than upper limit, and higher than\r\n the lower limit of fold enrichment. DEFAULT:10,30 means using all\r\n regions not too low (>10) and not too high (<30) to build\r\n paired-peaks model. If MACS can not find more than 100 regions to\r\n build model, it will use the --shiftsize parameter to continue the\r\n peak detection.\r\n\r\n Check related *--off-auto* and *--shiftsize* for detail.\r\n\r\n- --nolambda\r\n\r\n With this flag on, MACS will use the background lambda as local\r\n lambda. This means MACS will not consider the local bias at peak\r\n candidate regions.\r\n\r\n- --slocal, --llocal\r\n\r\n These two parameters control which two levels of regions will be\r\n checked around the peak regions to calculate the maximum lambda as\r\n local lambda. By default, MACS considers 1000bp for small local\r\n region(--slocal), and 10000bps for large local region(--llocal) which\r\n captures the bias from a long range effect like an open chromatin\r\n domain. You can tweak these according to your project. Remember that\r\n if the region is set too small, a sharp spike in the input data may\r\n kill the significant peak.\r\n\r\n- --off-auto\r\n\r\n Whether turn off the auto paired-peak model process. If not set, when\r\n MACS failed to build paired model, it will use the nomodel settings,\r\n the '--shiftsize' parameter to shift and extend each tags. If set,\r\n MACS will be terminated if paried-peak model is failed.\r\n\r\n- --nomodel\r\n\r\n While on, MACS will bypass building the shifting model.\r\n\r\n- --shiftsize\r\n\r\n While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to shift tags to\r\n their midpoint. For example, if the size of binding region for your\r\n transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model\r\n building by MACS, this parameter can be set as 100. This option is\r\n only valid when --nomodel is set or when MACS fails to build\r\n paired-peak model.\r\n\r\n-  --keep-dup\r\n\r\n It controls the MACS behavior towards duplicate tags at the exact\r\n same location -- the same coordination and the same strand. The\r\n default 'auto' option makes MACS calculate the maximum tags at the\r\n exact same location based on binomal distribution using 1e-5 as\r\n pvalue cutoff; and the 'all' option keeps every tags.  If an integer\r\n is given, at most this number of tags will be kept at the same\r\n location. Default: auto\r\n\r\n- --broad              \r\n\r\n When this flag is on, MACS will try to composite broad regions in\r\n BED12 ( a gene-model-like format ) by putting nearby highly enriched\r\n regions into a broad region with loose cutoff. The broad region is\r\n controlled by another cutoff through --broad-cutoff. The maximum\r\n length of broad region length is 4 times of d from MACS. DEFAULT:\r\n False\r\n\r\n- --broad-cutoff\r\n\r\n Cutoff for broad region. This option is not available unless --broad\r\n is set. If -p is set, this is a pvalue cutoff, otherwise, it's a\r\n qvalue cutoff.  DEFAULT: 0.1\r\n\r\n- --to-large\r\n\r\n When set, linearly scale the smaller dataset to the same depth as\r\n larger dataset, by default, the smaller dataset will be scaled\r\n towards the larger dataset. Beware, to scale up small data would\r\n cause more false positives.\r\n\r\n- --down-sample\r\n\r\n When set, random sampling method will scale down the bigger\r\n sample. By default, MACS uses linear scaling. This option will make\r\n the results unstable and irreproducible since each time, random reads\r\n would be selected, especially the numbers (pileup, pvalue, qvalue)\r\n would change. Consider to use 'randsample' script before MACS2 runs\r\n instead.\r\n\r\n- -B/--bdg\r\n\r\n If this flag is on, MACS will store the fragment pileup, control\r\n lambda, -log10pvalue and -log10qvalue scores in bedGraph files. The\r\n bedGraph files will be stored in current directory named\r\n NAME+'_treat_pileup.bdg' for treatment data,\r\n NAME+'_control_lambda.bdg' for local lambda values from control,\r\n NAME+'_treat_pvalue.bdg' for Poisson pvalue scores (in -log10(pvalue)\r\n form), and NAME+'_treat_qvalue.bdg' for q-value scores from\r\n Benjamini–Hochberg–Yekutieli procedure\r\n <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Dependent_tests>\r\n\r\n- --half-ext (experimental option)\r\n\r\n When this flag is on, MACS will only extend each tag with 1/2 d\r\n (predicted ChIP fragment size) instead of full d.\r\n\r\n- -w/--wig is obsolete.\r\n\r\n- -S/--single-profile is obsolete.\r\n\r\n- --space=SPACE is obsolete since we don't generate wiggle file.\r\n\r\n- --call-subpeaks is currently not functional.\r\n\r\n If set, MACS will invoke Mali Salmon's PeakSplitter software through\r\n system call. If PeakSplitter can't be found, an instruction will be\r\n shown for downloading and installing the PeakSplitter package. The\r\n PeakSplitter can refine the MACS peaks and split the wide peaks into\r\n smaller subpeaks. For more information, please check the following\r\n URL:\r\n\r\n http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bertone/software/PeakSplitter_Cpp_usage.txt\r\n\r\n Note this option doesn't work if -B/--bdg is on.\r\n\r\n- --verbose\r\n\r\n If you don't want to see any message during the running of MACS, set\r\n it to 0. But the CRITICAL messages will never be hidden. If you want\r\n to see rich information like how many peaks are called for every\r\n chromosome, you can set it to 3 or larger than 3.\r\n\r\n- --diag is currently not functional.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis report can be generated through this option. This report\r\n can help you get an assumption about the sequencing saturation. This\r\n funtion is only in beta stage.\r\n\r\n- --fe-min, --fe-max & --fe-step are currently not functional.\r\n\r\n For diagnostics, FEMIN and FEMAX are the minimum and maximum fold\r\n enrichment to consider, and FESTEP is the interval of fold\r\n enrichment. For example, \"--fe-min 0 --fe-max 40 --fe-step 10\" will\r\n let MACS choose the following fold enrichment ranges to consider:\r\n [0,10), [10,20), [20,30) and [30,40).\r\n\r\nOutput files\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n 1. NAME_peaks.xls is a tabular file which contains information about\r\n    called peaks. You can open it in excel and sort/filter using excel\r\n    functions. Information include: chromosome name, start position of\r\n    peak, end position of peak, length of peak region, absolute peak\r\n    summit position, pileup height at peak summit, -log10(pvalue) for\r\n    the peak summit (e.g. pvalue =1e-10, then this value should be\r\n    10), fold enrichment for this peak summit against random Poisson\r\n    distribution with local lambda, -log10(qvalue) at peak\r\n    summit. Coordinates in XLS is 1-based which is different with BED\r\n    format.\r\n\r\n 2. NAME_peaks.bed is BED format file which contains the peak\r\n    locations. You can load it to UCSC genome browser or Affymetrix\r\n    IGB software. The file can be loaded directly to UCSC genome\r\n    browser. Remove the beginning track line if you want to analyze it\r\n    by other tools.\r\n\r\n 3. NAME_peaks.encodePeak is BED6+4 format file which contains the\r\n    peak locations together with peak summit, pvalue and qvalue. You\r\n    can load it to UCSC genome browser. Definition of some specific\r\n    columns are: 5th: integer score for display, 7th: fold-change,\r\n    8th: -log10pvalue, 9th: -log10qvalue, 10th: relative summit\r\n    position to peak start. The file can be loaded directly to UCSC\r\n    genome browser. Remove the beginning track line if you want to\r\n    analyze it by other tools.\r\n\r\n 4. NAME_summits.bed is in BED format, which contains the peak summits\r\n    locations for every peaks. The 5th column in this file is\r\n    -log10pvalue the same as NAME_peaks.bed. If you want to find the\r\n    motifs at the binding sites, this file is recommended. The file\r\n    can be loaded directly to UCSC genome browser. Remove the\r\n    beginning track line if you want to analyze it by other tools.\r\n\r\n 5. NAME_broad_peaks.bed is in BED12 format which contains both the\r\n    broad region and narrow peaks. The 5th column is 100*-log10pvalue,\r\n    to be more compatible to UCSC standard. Tht 7th is the start of\r\n    the first narrow peak in the region, and the 8th column is the\r\n    end. The 9th column should be RGB color key, however, we keep 0\r\n    here to use the default color, so change it if you want. The 10th\r\n    column tells how many blocks including the starting 1bp and ending\r\n    1bp of broad regions. The 11th column shows the length of each\r\n    blocks, and 12th for the starts of each blocks. The file can be\r\n    loaded directly to UCSC genome browser. Remove the beginning track\r\n    line if you want to analyze it by other tools.\r\n\r\n 6. NAME_model.r is an R script which you can use to produce a PDF\r\n    image about the model based on your data. Load it to R by:\r\n\r\n    ```$ R --vanilla < NAME_model.r```\r\n\r\n    Then a pdf file NAME_model.pdf will be generated in your current\r\n    directory. Note, R is required to draw this figure.\r\n\r\n 7. The .bdg files are in bedGraph format which can be imported to\r\n    UCSC genome browser or be converted into even smaller bigWig\r\n    files. Four kinds of bdg files include treat_pileup,\r\n    control_lambda, treat_pvalue, and treat_qvalue.\r\n\r\n 8. NAME_pqtable.txt store the -log10pvalue, -log10qvalue, rank of\r\n    this pvalue, and number of bp having this pvalue.\r\n\r\nOther useful links\r\n==================\r\n\r\n:Cistrome, a web server for ChIP-chip/seq analysis: http://cistrome.org/ap/\r\n:bedTools, a super useful toolkits for genome annotation files: http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/\r\n:UCSC toolkits: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/\r\n\r\nTips of fine-tuning peak calling\r\n================================\r\n\r\nCheck the three scripts within MACSv2 package:\r\n\r\n 1. bdgcmp can be used on ```*_treat_pileup.bdg``` and\r\n    ```*_control_lambda.bdg``` or bedGraph files from other resources\r\n    to calculate score track.\r\n\r\n 2. bdgpeakcall can be used on ```*_treat_pvalue.bdg``` or the file\r\n    generated from bdgcmp or bedGraph file from other resources to\r\n    call peaks with given cutoff, maximum-gap between nearby mergable\r\n    peaks and minimum length of peak. bdgbroadcall works similarly to\r\n    bdgpeakcall, however it will output _broad_peaks.bed in BED12\r\n    format.\r\n\r\n 3. Differential calling tool -- bdgdiff, can be used on 4 bedgraph\r\n    files which are scores between treatment 1 and control 1,\r\n    treatment 2 and control 2, treatment 1 and treatment 2, treatment\r\n    2 and treatment 1. It will output the consistent and unique sites\r\n    according to parameter settings for minimum length, maximum gap\r\n    and cutoff.",
