    "description": "django-postgresql-setrole27\n=========================\n\nThis is a Python 2.7 port of `Jonas Maurus <https://github.com/jdelic>`' django-postgresql-setrole\npackage.\n\nA Django application that executes `SET ROLE` on every connection to PostgreSQL\nopened by Django. This is useful if you're using external authentication\nmanagers like `Hashicorp Vault <http://vaultproject.io/>`__\\ .\n\nPostgreSQL's user model (\"roles\") assigns every object created in a database/\ntablespace/schema an \"owner\". Said owner is the *only* user that can modify or\ndrop the object. This means that user credentials leased from Vault which\nexpire after some time, can't be used to create or migrate tables unless you \nuse the same user name every time (which would defeat the purpose).\n\nThe solution is to create an \"owner role\". In layman's terms \"a group that has\nall necessary permissions on the database and the INHERIT attribute and will\nact as the 'sudo' user for leased users from the authentication manager\". All\nusers created by the authentication manager will then be assigned this group\nand when they connect to the database execute \"SET ROLE <owner role>\", thereby\nmaking all objects created owned by the owner role.\n\n\nHow do I use this Django application?\n-------------------------------------\nAdd `postgresql_setrole` to `INSTALLED_APPS`. Then in `settings.DATABASES` add\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    DATABASES = {\n        \"default\": {\n            ...,  # other settings\n            \"SET_ROLE\": \"mydatabaseowner\",\n        }.\n    }\n\n\nWhy is SET ROLE necessary?\n--------------------------\nThe `INHERIT` attribute is not bidirectional. So if a (user) role is assigned\na (group) role it inherits the group's permissions, but the group does not\ngain any rights on objects created by the user role.\n\nSo what you want is the (group) owner role to own everything.\n\n\nHow do I set this up?\n---------------------\nOn your shell as the `postgres` superuser:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    # --- create an admin role for Vault\n    # no create database\n    # encrypt password\n    # do not inherit rights\n    # can create roles\n    # not a superuser\n    createuser -D -E -I -l -r -S vaultadmin\n\n    # --- create an owner role for your database\n    # no create database\n    # encrypt password\n    # do not inherit rights\n    # can't create roles\n    # not a superuser\n    createuser -D -E -I -L -R -S mydatabaseowner\n    createdb -E utf8 -O mydatabaseowner mydatabase\n\nThen configure Vault to create roles like this:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ vault mount -path=mydatabase-auth postgresql\n    $ vault write mydatabase-auth/roles/fullaccess -\n    {\n        \"sql\": \"CREATE ROLE \\\"{{name}}\\\" WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}' IN ROLE \\\"mydatabaseowner\\\" INHERIT NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB NOSUPERUSER NOREPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS;\",\n        \"revocation_sql\": \"DROP ROLE \\\"{{name}}\\\";\"\n    }\n\nThen users created by Vault when they log in must run\n\n.. code-block:: sql\n\n    SET ROLE \"mydatabaseowner\";\n\nThis ensures that all created tables and other objects belong to\n`mydatabaseowner`.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (c) 2016, Jonas Maurus\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
