    "description": "django-rated\n============\n\nA rate limiting middleware for Django\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nrated allows you to limit the requests per hour a single client may attempt on views in 'realms' of your site.\n\nYou control which views are in which 'realm' by either decorating the view, or adding the url pattern into the realm map.\n\nrated will keep track of how many requests, and when, a client has made and, if they've exceeded their limit, will return a 503 - Service Unavailable response.\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nIn your settings.py add to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:\n    'rated.middleware.RatedMiddleware',\n\nConfiguring\n===========\n\nNext, configure your realms.  This is done by defining them in the RATED_REALMS setting.  This is a dict where the keys are realm names, and the values are dicts of configs.\n\nA realm config may contain any of the following keys.  Any omitted fall back to the defaults from the settings below.\n\n    whitelist:  A list of IPs to exclude from rate limiting.\n    timeout:    Time after which any requests are forgotten\n    limit:      Number of requests before limiting is applied.\n    code:       HTTP Status code to use when limiting is applied.\n    message:    Response content to return when limiting is applied.\n\nIf you're planning to put all limited views into the one realm, you don't need to define RATED_REALMS - the defaults will be used instead.\n\nAssign Realms\n=============\n\nThere are three ways to apply rate limits.  Either decorate the view directly, add a realm with the same url pattern name, or map the url pattern name to a realm.\n\nYou can add mark a view as in the default realm simply:\n\n    @rated_realm\n    def myview(...)\n\nTo add it to a specific realm:\n\n    @rated_realm(realm='other')\n    def myview(...)\n\nOtherwise, if the url pattern is named, and the name matches a realm name, it will be considered part of that realm.  There is also the RATED_REALM_MAP, which will map url pattern names to realm names.  The url pattern name is always mapped through here.\n\nSettings\n========\n\nRATED_DEFAULT_REALM:\n    The default realm to put views into.\n    Default: 'default'\n\nRATED_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT:\n    How long an access history persists with no accesses.\n    Default: 1 hour\n\nRATED_DEFAULT_LIMIT:\n    Limit of how many requests an individual client is permitted per hour.\n    Default: 100\n\nRATED_RESPONSE_CODE:\n    HTTP Status code to return when a request is limited.\n    Default: 429\n\nRATED_RESPONSE_MESSAGE:\n    Content to include in response when a request is limited.\n    Default: ''\n\nRATED_REALMS:\n    A dict of config dicts.\n    The keys are realm names.\n    The values are dicts containing overrides for 'limit', 'timeout' and 'whitelist'.\n    Default: {}\n\nRATED_REALM_MAP:\n    A mapping of url pattern names to realms.\n    This allows you to apply limits to views in 3rd party apps.\n    Default: {}\n\nRATED_REDIS:\n    Redis config settings.\n\nRATED_DEFAULT_WHITELIST:\n    A list of IPs who are exempt from rate limiting.\n",
