    "description": "django_safeform\n===============\n\nCSRF protection for Django implemented at the form level - no middleware \nrequired.\n\nThere are two steps to protecting a django.forms form:\n\n1. Wrap it with the SafeForm class decorator. This adds a hidden csrf_token \n   field to it along with validation logic for checking if that token has \n   the correct value. It also changes the signature of the form class \n   slightly, see example below.\n2. Apply the @csrf_protect middleware to the view containing the form. This \n   ensures that a _csrf_cookie is correctly set.\n\nRun \"./manage.py runserver\" in the examples folder to start a Django server \ndemonstrating the functionality of the library. Use \"./manage.py test\" in the \nsame directory to run the unit tests.\n\nExample usage::\n\n    from django import forms\n    from django.http import HttpResponse\n    from django.shortcuts import render_to_response\n    from django_safeform import SafeForm, csrf_protect\n    \n    class ChangePasswordForm(forms.Form):\n        password = forms.CharField(widget = forms.PasswordInput)\n        password2 = forms.CharField(widget = forms.PasswordInput)\n    \n    ChangePasswordForm = SafeForm(ChangePasswordForm)\n    \n    @csrf_protect\n    def change_password(request):\n        form = ChangePasswordForm(request) # A\n        if form.is_valid(): # B\n            # ... change the user's password here\n            return HttpResponse('Thank you')\n        return render_to_response('change_password.html', {\n            'form': form,\n        })\n\nA: Note that we pass the whole request object to the constructor, instead of\njust passing request.POST.\n\nB: A pleasant side-effect of SafeForm is that you no longer need to check to \nsee if request.method == 'POST' in order to decide whether or not to bind a \nform to a set of input data - SafeForm handles this for you.\n\nCustom form templates\n---------------------\n\nIf your template uses one of the form rendering helper methods such as \n{{ form.as_p }} the hidden csrf_token field will be output automatically. If \nyou are rendering the form using a custom template you will need to remember \nto output that field in your template explicitly. Here's an example::\n\n    <form action=\"/change-password/\" method=\"post\">\n        {{ form.non_field_errors }}\n        <div{% if form.password.errors %} class=\"errors\"{% endif %}>\n            <label for=\"id_password\">New password</label>\n            {{ form.password }}\n        </div>\n        <div{% if form.password2.errors %} class=\"errors\"{% endif %}>\n            <label for=\"id_password2\">Confirm password</label>\n            {{ form.password2 }}\n        </div>\n        <div>{{ form.csrf_token }}<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Change\"></div>\n    </form>\n\nNote the {{ form.csrf_token }} replacement variable just before the submit \nbutton - this will output a hidden form field containing the correct value.\n\nYou should also be sure to include {{ form.non_field_errors }} somewhere in \nyour template - this is where the \"Form session expired - please resubmit\" \nmessage will be displayed should the CSRF check fail for some reason.\n\nProtecting forms that do not use django.forms\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are not using the django.forms framework - for example you are writing \nforms with hand-written HTML and pulling submitted data directly from \nrequest.POST - you can still add CSRF protection to your forms using the \n@csrf_protect decorator in conjunction with the csrf_utils module::\n\n    from django_safeform import csrf_protect, csrf_utils\n    \n    @csrf_protect\n    def hand_rolled(request):\n        if request.method == 'POST':\n            csrf_token = request.POST.get('csrf_token', '')\n            if not csrf_utils.validate_csrf_token(csrf_token, request):\n                return HttpResponse('Invalid CSRF token')\n            else:\n                return HttpResponse('OK')\n        else:\n            return HttpResponse(\"\"\"\n            <form action=\".\" method=\"post\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\">\n            <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf_token\" value=\"%s\">\n            </form>\n            \"\"\" % csrf_utils.new_csrf_token(request))\n\nIt is your responsibility to include a hidden form field with the value from \ncsrf_utils.new_csrf_token(request) in your form, and to check that token when \nthe form is submitted using csrf_utils.validate_csrf_token.\n\nYou could also use CsrfForm to protect hand-written forms, as explained in \nthe next section.\n\nProtecting formsets / multiple forms on the same page\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have multiple forms on the page and they are each contained in separate\n<form> elements, you should ensure each one has a csrf_token field, most \nlikely by configuring each one using the SafeForm class decorator.\n\nIf you have multiple django.forms forms within a single <form> element (for \nexample, if you are using formsets) you still only need to include a single \ncsrf_token field for the overall form. In this case, rather than applying the \nSafeForm decorator to each of the form classes, it makes more sense to have a \nsingle standalone SafeForm instance within the overall form. The CsrfForm \nclass is designed to handle this exact use-case. Here's how to use it::\n    \n    from django import forms\n    from django.forms.formsets import formset_factory\n    from django_safeform import csrf_protect, CsrfForm\n    from django.http import HttpResponse\n    \n    class PersonForm(forms.Form):\n        name = forms.CharField(max_length = 100)\n        email = forms.EmailField()\n    \n    PersonFormSet = formset_factory(PersonForm, extra=3)\n    \n    @csrf_protect\n    def formset(request):\n        csrf_form = CsrfForm(request)\n        formset = PersonFormSet()\n        if request.method == 'POST':\n            formset = PersonFormSet(request.POST)\n            if csrf_form.is_valid() and formset.is_valid():\n                return HttpResponse('Valid: %s' % ', '.join([\n                    '%(name)s [%(email)s]' % form.cleaned_data \n                    for form in formset.forms\n                    if form.cleaned_data\n                ]))\n        return render_to_response('formset.html', {\n            'csrf_form': csrf_form,\n            'formset': formset,\n        })\n\nThe formset is used in the same way as usual. The CSRF protection is \nimplemented entirely by the separate CsrfForm instance. In the template, the \nCsrfForm should be output using {{ csrf_form }} like this::\n\n    <form action=\".\" method=\"post\">\n        {{ csrf_form }}\n        {% for form in formset.forms %}\n            {{ form.as_p }}\n        {% endfor %}\n        <p>\n            {{ formset.management_form }}\n            <input type=\"submit\">\n        </p>\n    </form>\n\nThe {{ csrf_form }} template tag specifies where the hidden input field \ncontaining the form token should be included. Should a CSRF failure occur, it \nalso specifies where the <ul class=\"errorlist\"> containing the CSRF failure \nmessage should be displayed.\n\nIf you want to include the hidden input field in a different location to the \nerror message, you can use {{ csrf_form.csrf_token }} to output the hidden \nfield and {{ csrf_form.non_field_errors }} to output the error message::\n\n    <form action=\".\" method=\"post\">\n        {{ csrf_form.non_field_errors }}\n        {% for form in formset.forms %}\n            {{ form.as_p }}\n        {% endfor %}\n        <p>\n            {{ formset.management_form }}\n            {{ csrf_form.csrf_token }}\n            <input type=\"submit\">\n        </p>\n    </form>\n\n\nChanging the CSRF error message\n-------------------------------\n\nThe default message shown to the user if the CSRF check fails is::\n\n    Form session expired - please resubmit\n\nThe wording here is deliberately a bit vague - most users will have no idea \nwhat a \"CSRF failure\" is, but users have probably seen \"session expired\" \nmessages before. A \"form session\" seems like a reasonable metaphor for what \nis going on under the hood.\n\nIf you dislike this message, you can over-ride it in your call to the \nSafeForm class decorator::\n\n    ChangePasswordForm = SafeForm(ChangePasswordForm,\n        invalid_message='CSRF check failed'\n    )\n\nHandling Ajax\n-------------\n\nBy default, Ajax requests do NOT have CSRF protection applied to them - they \nwill be ignored by the form validator, which looks out for any requests where \nrequest.is_ajax() returns True (i.e. requests which have a X-Requested_With\nheader set to XMLHttpRequest). This custom header is set by most common Ajax \nlibraries. Protection is not needed here because it is not possible to forge \nHTTP headers when committing a CSRF attack using an HTML form.\n\nIf you are ultra-paranoid and want to apply CSRF protection even to requests \nwith that header, you can disable the Ajax special case like this::\n\n    ChangePasswordForm = SafeForm(ChangePasswordForm,\n        ajax_skips_check=False\n    )\n\nIf you do this, you will need to ensure the csrf_token is included in Ajax\nPOST requests yourself. One way to do this would be to read the token out of \nthe first hidden input field with name=\"csrf_token\" using the JavaScript DOM.\n\nEnhancing security\n------------------\n\nBy default, the form tokens served up in hidden fields are valid for POST \nsubmissions to any form on the site (for the user with that cookie) and never \nexpire. You can limit the scope of the tokens in two ways - by tying them to \na specific form, or by causing them to expire after a number of seconds.\n\nTo tie a token to one specific form, simply pass an identifier argument to \nthe SafeForm decorator::\n\n    ChangePasswordForm = SafeForm(ChangePasswordForm,\n        identifier='change-password'\n    )\n\nTokens generated for that form will now only allow submissions back to the \nsame form. If you are using the csrf_utils module directly (in a hand-rolled \nform for example) you should pass identifier arguments to both the \nnew_csrf_token and validate_csrf_token functions::\n\n    token = csrf_utils.new_csrf_token(request, identifier='my-custom-form')\n    # ... later ...\n    token_ok = csrf_utils.validate_csrf_token(\n        token, request, identifier='my-custom-form'\n    )\n    if not token_ok:\n        return HttpResponse('Invalid CSRF token')\n\nTo cause your form tokens to expire, use the expire_after argument in your \ncall to the SafeForm class decorator::\n\n    ChangePasswordForm = SafeForm(ChangePasswordForm,\n        identifier='change-password',\n        expire_after=24 * 60 * 60 # Expire after 24 hours\n    )\n\nIf using csrf_utils directly, pass that argument to the validate_csrf_token \nfunction::\n\n    token_ok = csrf_utils.validate_csrf_token(\n        token, request, identifier='my-custom-form', expire_after=24 * 60 * 60\n    )\n\nThe default expire_after value is set by the CSRF_TOKENS_EXPIRE_AFTER setting,\nwhich defaults to None. If you want all of your CSRF tokens to expire, add \nthis to your settings.py file::\n\n    CSRF_TOKENS_EXPIRE_AFTER = 24 * 60 * 60\n\nWhen a token expires, the user will see the CSRF error message described above\nbut will not lose their form submission, so don't worry too much about the \nconsequences of setting a strict timeout.\n\nDesign notes\n------------\n\nApps shipped with Django, in particular the admin, MUST be secure against CSRF \nno matter what the user's configuration is (so dependency on middleware alone \nis a problem).\n\nSecure by default for user code would be nice, but in its absence explicitly \nraising developer awareness of CSRF is probably a good thing.\n\nShould not be tied to sessions - some developers might not be using them.\n\nShould not require the form framework - hand-rolled forms should be easy to \nprotect too.\n\nThe original idea was to have an alternative Form base class called SafeForm - \nthis was replaced with a class decorator when we realised that we would \notherwise also need to provide SafeModelForm, SafeFormSet and so on.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis library was developed out of a discussion with Russell Keith-Magee, \nAndrew Godwin and Armin Ronacher at the DjangoCon 2009 sprints.\n\nAlternative approaches\n----------------------\n\nPure middleware:\n - breaks with etags\n - rewrites HTML\n - doesn't work with streaming\n - you have to decorate things as exempt\n - potential leakage of external forms\n - XHTML v.s. HTML\n\nMiddleware and template tags and RequestContext:\n - uses a view middleware\n - applying by default is error prone\n - if user disables middleware, admin becomes insecure\n - requires RequestContext",
