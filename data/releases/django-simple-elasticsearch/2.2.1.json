    "description": "===========================\nDjango Simple Elasticsearch\n===========================\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-simple-elasticsearch.png\n  :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/django-simple-elasticsearch\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch.png\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch/badge.png\n  :target: https://coveralls.io/r/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch\n\n\nThis package provides a simple method of creating Elasticsearch indexes for\nDjango models.\n\n-----\n\nVersions\n--------\n\nBranch :code:`master` targets both Elasticsearch 2.x and 5.x and will receive new\nfeatures. Both `elasticsearch-py` 2.x and 5.x Python modules are currently\nsupported. `Documentation <http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/>`_\n\nBranch :code:`1.x` is the maintenance branch for the legacy 0.9.x versioned releases,\nwhich targeted Elasticsearch versions less than 2.0. This branch is unlikely to\nreceive new features, but will receive required fixes.\n`Documentation <http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/>`_\n\n**Using a version older than 0.9.0? Please be aware that as of v0.9.0, this package\nhas changed in a backwards-incompatible manner. Version 0.5 is deprecated and no\nlonger maintained.**\n\n-----\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nVisit the `django-simple-elasticsearch documentation on ReadTheDocs <http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.org/>`_.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* class mixin with a set of :code:`@classmethods` used to handle:\n * type mapping definition\n * individual object indexing and deletion\n * bulk object indexing\n * model signal handlers for pre/post_save and pre/post_delete (optional)\n* management command to handle index/type mapping initialization and bulk indexing\n * uses Elasticsearch aliases to ease the burden of re-indexing\n* small set of Django classes and functions to help deal with Elasticsearch querying\n * base search form class to handle input validation, query preparation and response handling\n * multi-search processor class to batch multiple Elasticsearch queries via :code:`_msearch`\n * 'get' shortcut functions\n* post index create/rebuild signals available to perform actions after certain stages (ie. add your own percolators)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nAt the command line::\n\n    $ easy_install django-simple-elasticsearch\n\nOr::\n\n    $ pip install django-simple-elasticsearch\n\nConfiguring\n-----------\n\nAdd the simple_elasticsearch application to your INSTALLED_APPS list::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'simple_elasticsearch',\n    )\n\nAdd any models to `ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_CLASSES` setting for indexing using **es_manage** management command::\n\n    ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_CLASSES = [\n        'blog.models.BlogPost'\n    ]\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n**django-simple-elasticsearch** is licensed as free software under the BSD license.\n\nTodo\n----\n\n* Review search classes - simplify functionality where possible. This may cause breaking changes.\n* Tests. Write them.\n* Documentation. Write it.\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n2.2.1 (2017-11-15)\n---------------------\n\n* Fixing an issue with the recently released elasticsearch-py 6.0.0\n\n2.2.0 (2017-07-17)\n---------------------\n\n* Addressing inability to index models with a non-integer PK field (ie. `UUIDField`) - added ability to order bulk queryset on an arbitrary model field.\n\n2.1.7 (2017-03-21)\n---------------------\n\n* Allowing direct access (again) to underlying dict/list in `Result` and `Response` classes for serialization and other purposes.\n\n2.1.5 (2017-03-20)\n---------------------\n\n* Response class is now MutableSequence based, giving it the properties of a `list`. Its `results` attribute is deprecated, as you can now iterate over the results with the response instance itself.\n* Result class `results_meta` is deprecated. Use `meta` instead.\n* `get_from_es_or_None` now returns a `Result` object instead of the raw Elasticsearch result, for consistency.\n* `get_from_es_or_None` now catches only the Elasticsearch `NotFoundError` exception; previously it caught the more expansive `ElasticsearchException`, which could hide unrelated errors/issues.\n\n2.1.4 (2017-03-12)\n---------------------\n\n* Result class is now MutableMapping based, giving it the properties of a `dict`. Its `data` attribute is deprecated.\n\n2.1.3 (2017-03-11)\n---------------------\n\n* Minor changes to enable support for elasticsearch-py 5.x.\n\n2.1.0 (2017-03-10)\n---------------------\n\n* Addressing a packaging problem which erroneously included pyc/__pycache__ files.\n\n2.0.0 (2016-12-20)\n---------------------\n\n* **ALERT: this is a backwards incompatible release**; the old `1.x` (formerly `0.9.x`+) code is maintained on a separate branch for now.\n* Added support for Django 1.10.\n* Ported delete/cleanup functionality from `1.x`.\n* Removed support for Django versions older than 1.8. The goal going forward will be to only support Django versions that the Django core team lists as supported.\n* Removed elasticsearch-dsl support: responses and results are now represented by simpler internal representations; queries can ONLY be done via a `dict` form.\n* Removed `ElasticsearchForm` - it is easy enough to build a form to validate search input and then form a query `dict` manually.\n* Renamed `ElasticsearchIndexMixin` to `ElasticsearchTypeMixin`, seeing as the mixin represented an ES type mapping, not an actual index.\n* Renamed `ElasticsearchProcessor` to `SimpleSearch`.\n* Overall, this module has been greatly simplified.\n\n1.0.0 (2016-12-20)\n---------------------\n\n* Updated 0.9.x codebase version to 1.0.0.\n* Reversed decision on the deprecation of the 0.9.x codebase - it will be maintained in this new 1.x branch, although new functionality will mostly occur on newer releases.\n* Adding cleanup command to remove unaliased indices.\n* Added ELASTICSEARCH_DELETE_OLD_INDEXES setting to auto-remove after a rebuild.\n* Thanks to Github user @jimjkelly for the index removal inspiration.\n\n0.9.16 (2015-04-24)\n---------------------\n\n* Addressing Django 1.8 warnings.\n\n0.9.15 (2015-01-31)\n---------------------\n\n* BUGFIX: Merging pull request from @key that addresses Python 3 support (management command now works).\n\n0.9.14 (2015-01-31)\n---------------------\n\n* BUGFIX: Adding in missing `signals.py` file.\n\n0.9.13 (2015-01-30)\n---------------------\n\n* Added in new `post_indices_create` and `post_indices_rebuild` signals to allow users to run actions at various points during the index creation and bulk indexing processes.\n\n0.9.12 (2014-12-17)\n---------------------\n\n* fixed an issue where per-item request parameters were being added to the bulk data request JSON incorrectly. Tests updated.\n\n0.9.11 (2014-12-08)\n---------------------\n\n* added warning if Django's DEBUG=True (causes out of memory errors on constrained\n  systems due to Django query caching)\n* added index setting modification on rebuilding indices to remove replicas, lucene\n  segment merging and disabling the refresh interval - restoring the original\n  settings afterwards.\n\n0.9.10 (2014-12-04)\n---------------------\n\n* added `page` and `page_size` validation in `add_search()`\n\n0.9.9 (2014-11-24)\n---------------------\n\n* Renamed search form related classes - more breaking changes. Added in support\n  for Django's pagination classes (internal hack).\n\n0.9.8 (2014-11-23)\n---------------------\n\n* Revamped search form related classes - includes breaking changes.\n\n0.9.7 (2014-11-16)\n---------------------\n\n* Python3 supported mentioned in PyPi categorization; new testcases added. Minor\n  interface change (added `@classmethod`).\n\n0.9.6 (2014-11-16)\n---------------------\n\n* Python 3.3+ support, modified (no new) testcases.\n\n0.9.5 (2014-11-15)\n---------------------\n\n* Added in tox support, initial set of test cases and verified travis-ci is working.\n\n0.9.2 (2014-11-12)\n---------------------\n\n* Fixed broken management command.\n\n0.9.1 (2014-11-10)\n---------------------\n\n* Added missing management command module.\n\n0.9.0 (2014-11-10)\n---------------------\n\n* In what will become version 1.0, this 0.9.x codebase is a revamp of the\n  original codebase (v0.5.x). Completely breaking over previous versions.\n\n0.5.0 (2014-03-05)\n---------------------\n\nFinal release in 0.x codebase - this old codebase is now unmaintained.\n\n\n",
