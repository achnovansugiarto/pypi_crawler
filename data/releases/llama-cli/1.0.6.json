    "description": "# Llama CLI\n\nA utility program that fetches and preprocesses learning data from supported learning\ntools. Educators and researches have important usecases for accessing the raw data\nthat is generated while learners are using digital learning tools and environments.\nThese stakeholders can aim to e.g. analyse and improve teaching materials, methods,\nand activities.\n\nThe aim of Llama CLI is to support and ease the steps of\n1. connecting to the supported learning data sources\n2. excluding persons and unwanted data tables or columns\n3. fetching partial and complete data sets\n4. anonymizing data before research activities\n5. standardizing or transforming data\n6. sampling and selecing data for analysis/ML\n\nCurrently supported data sources are\n* A-plus https://apluslms.github.io/\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name for the project comes from ~ la lumière à Montagne analytique. Pardon my French for ~ light on the mountain of analytics. Also LA is an acronym, that the\npackage author may have used in his thesis more than a decent number of times,\nand that stands for Learning Analytics which is a research field in education\ntechnologies. Llamas are also known from a controversial programming exercise for\ncomputer science majors at Aalto University.\n\n## Installation\n\nLlama CLI is available at PyPI. It has a number of automatically installed\ndependencies, most notably `pandas`, `numpy`, and `requests`.\n\n      % python3 -m pip install llama-cli\n      % llama\n\nOR contained in a virtual environment (directory)\n\n      % python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install llama-cli\n      % .venv/bin/llama\n\n## Instructions\n\nLlama CLI operates on the current working directory. The configurations and data\nwill be stored in that directory – little bit like when working with git repositories.\nOne work directory can connect with multiple data sources and one should select\nthe sources that the current research or analysis project requires.\n\n      % llama\n      Llama CLI fetches and preprocesses learning data\n\n      usage: llama <cmd> [<args>]\n\n         status      Show the working tree status\n         source      Manage sources for learning data\n         list        List available data tables and columns\n         privacy     Configure privacy (default: pseudoanonymous)\n         exclude     Exclude selected tables, columns, or persons at fetch\n         fetch       Fetch data from sources\n         anonymize   Export anonymized data\n         shell       Open python REPL with 'llama' instance to fetched data\n\n1. Use `llama source add` to interactively connect with data sources.\n   The required addresses and keys will be prompted when required.\n2. Use `llama list` to fetch the available data tables.\n3. Time to consider excluding some uninteresting data or persons who have\n   not consent to the research at hand. See `llama exclude` for examples.\n4. Use `llama fetch rows` to download data tables. Depending on the project\n   it may be necessary to also `llama fetch files` and/or `llama fetch meta`.\n   This step has a delay between internet requests and it may take a long time\n   to complete. The rows can be fetched again to append new data if supported\n   by the data source.\n5. The data in `fetched` directory is pseudoanonymized by default.\n   The pseudo identifiers are required to complete fetching of depended data.\n   Use `llama anonymize` to produce `export` directory that can be e.g. stored in\n   research repository when the security measures and research consent allow it.\n\n## Output\n\nThe Python class `from llama import Llama` offers some programmatic accessors\nand samplers to the data for further processing and analysis, as well as\ninteractive testing via `llama shell`.\n\nNaturally, the raw CSV and other files are available in `export` directory.\n\n## TODO\n\n* Some R scripts for fast access and general measures & visualizations\n  could be added.\n\n\n",
