Note that the projects\nare not stored, but only listed. This is useful if you want to showcase\nprojects on your blog, come out with new announcements, etc.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe easiest way is to use PIP:\n\n::\n\n    pip install django-project-goblin\n\nAdd ``'goblin'`` to the list of installed apps.\n\n::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        # ...\n        'goblin',\n        #...\n    )\n\n\nModels\n======\n\nOnce installed, you'll have access to Project Goblin's models:\n\nProject\n-------\n\nA project is a software project and can contain many releases. The main\nattributes for a software project are (self-explainator):\n\n* name\n* description\n* README (a longer description)\n* homepage (URL link to a project).\n\nRelease\n-------\n\nThe release has a foreign key relation to `Project`_ and to `Change`_. This is\nused to make readers aware of the release that has taken place for the project.\n\nThe attributes for a release are\n\n* project (FK to `Project`_)\n* version (The `Version`_ number)\n* download (URL to download the release)\n\nChange\n------\n\nA change is a difference of one release over another. A change is something\nthat is\n\n1. Added,\n2. Removed,\n3. Fixed, or\n4. something else (Other).\n\nIn addition, a change is given a description (the ``what`` field) where the\ndeveloper can write a description of the change that occurred.\n\nFields & Input\n==============\n\nVersion\n-------\n\nA version is--essentially--a list with an added attribute \"stage\" that can be\none of the following values:\n\n* DEV\n* ALPHA\n* BETA\n* TEST\n* RELEASE\n\nWhen comparing versions, the stage is always incorporated in the comparison.\nFor example, the versions ``0.1`` and ``0.1`` are equal, but the versions\n``0.1-test`` and ``0.1-dev`` are not.\n\nVersionField\n------------\n\nModel field for a version. For now, this is a CharField. However, a restriction\ndoes exist for the version format. It must pass the following regexp test:::\n\n    (\\d+\\.)+\\d+((\\-(dev|test|release))|[ab])\n\nHere are examples of acceptable input::\n\n    0.1a\n    1.5.8\n    13.4-dev\n\nHere are examples of not-so-acceptable (e.g. invalid!) input::\n\n    0-alpha14\n    0.1.-34.0\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nErrors Thrown\n=============\n\nNotLatestVersionException\n-------------------------\n\nThis is thrown when a release is being added to a project and the release's\nversion is not greater than the last added version. For example, if a project's\nlatest version is 1.0 and you're trying to add a version 0.8, the exception\nwill be thrown.",
