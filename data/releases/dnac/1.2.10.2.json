They handle all the complexity involved with making CRUD calls to Cisco DNAC including:\n  - Automatically logging in and getting an XAuth token\n  - Formatting URLs and filters to control requests to Cisco DNAC\n  - Parsing responses from Cisco DNAC and converting from json text into python objects\n\n# Installation and Usage\nIn addition to the source files available through Cisco DevNet and GitHub, the Cisco DNAC wrapper may be installed from the [distribution package on PiPy.](https://pypi.org/project/dnac/)\n\nFirst, use the command _pip install dnac_ to download the package and install it in your python site package listing.\n\nThen, edit the wrapper's configuration file, _dnac_config.py_, with your Cisco DNA Center cluster information.  Look in the directory _python-root-dir/Lib/site-packages/dnac/_ for the configuration file.\n\nAfter installing the wrapper, import the Dnac class directly from the package but treat the various API modules as sub-packages.  For example:\n\n    from dnac import Dnac\n\n    d = Dnac()\n\n    from dnac.networkdevice import NetworkDevice\n\n    switch = NetworkDevice(d, \"mySwitch\")\n\n# Versioning\nIn order to remain consistent with Cisco's DNA Center release cycle, this package follows a similar versioning structure.  Simply stated, the format is _Cisco-DNAC-version.wrapper-version_.  Take for example, release 1.2.10.2 of this package.  1.2.10 refers to the version of Cisco DNA Center which the package was tested against, and .2 indicates the version of the wrapper itself.\n\n#

embedded in modules to a test package structure.\n- More enhancements to networkdevice\n- Interface class\n\n# History\nv.1.2.10.1: 13 Mar 2019\n- Completed packaging for distribution on PiPy and renamed the package to 'dnac'.\n- Updated README.\n\nv.1.2.10.0: 7 Mar 2019\n- Modified version numbering to match Cisco DNA Center release cycle.\n- Most attributes are now protected (read-only) with only a handful being private or public.\n- Changed TaskResults class to File class in order to match Cisco DNAC's schema.\n- Moved documentation and examples into subpackages.\n- Added setuptools
