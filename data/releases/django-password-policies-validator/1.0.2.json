    "description": "==================================\ndjango-password-policies-validator\n==================================\n\ndjango-password-policies-validator is a Django app to validate password complexity and prevent users from reusing previous passwords.\n\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\n#. Add \"password_policies\" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'password_policies',\n    ]\n\n#. Add validators to AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS setting::\n\n    AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [\n        ...\n        {\n            'NAME': 'password_policies.password_validation.ComplexityValidator',\n        },\n        {\n            'NAME': 'password_policies.password_validation.ReusedPasswordValidator',\n        },\n        {\n            'NAME': 'password_policies.password_validation.MinimumChangeIntervalValidator',\n        },\n    ]\n\n#. Append ``PasswordExpirationMiddleware`` to MIDDLEWARE setting, note that this must be listed **after** the ``'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'`` ::\n\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        ...\n        'password_policies.middleware.PasswordExpirationMiddleware',\n    ]\n\n#. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the ``PasswordRecord`` models.\n\n#. Start the development server and go to the \"Change password\" page to check how the new password policies applied.\n\n\nThe ``Validator`` classes\n-------------------------\n\nCustom options can be passed into validators by the following syntax ::\n\n    AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [\n        ...\n        {\n            'NAME': 'password_policies.password_validation.ComplexityValidator',\n            'OPTIONS': {\n                'min_char_categories': 3,\n                'min_numeric_chars': 2,\n            }\n        },\n    ]\n\nAvailable options of each validator and their default values are listed below.\n\n``ComplexityValidator(min_char_categories=4, min_numeric_chars=1, min_uppercase_chars=1, min_lowercase_chars=1, min_special_chars=1)``\n    Validates that the password is complex enough by checking how many categories of characters it contains, or the count of certain category of characters. Characters are devided into four categories:\n\n    - Uppercase alphabet characters A-Z\n    - Lowercase alphabet characters a-z\n    - Numeric characters 0-9\n    - Non-alphanumeric (special) characters\n\n    ``min_char_categories``\n        The minimum categories of characters that the password should contain out of the four categories above. Value should be between 1 and 4.\n\n    ``min_numeric_chars``\n        The minimum count of numeric characters that the password should contain. Value should be 0 or any positive integer.\n\n    ``min_uppercase_chars``\n        The minimum count of uppercase characters that the password should contain. Value should be 0 or any positive integer.\n\n    ``min_lowercase_chars``\n        The minimum count of lowercase characters that the password should contain. Value should be 0 or any positive integer.\n\n    ``min_special_chars``\n        The minimum count of special characters that the password should contain. Value should be 0 or any positive integer.\n\n``ReusedPasswordValidator(record_length=3)``\n    Remembers the user's previous *n* passwords and validate the new password doed not repeat any of them.\n\n    ``record_length``\n        The number of previous password records that the validator should compare against. Value should be any positive integer.\n\n``MinimumChangeIntervalValidator(min_interval=1)``\n    Prevent the user from changing the password again within certain period of time. This is to avoid the user to bypass ``ReusedPasswordValidator`` and reuse the old password by changing passwords repeatedly in a short period of time. \n\n    ``min_interval``\n        The minimum time interval (in days) of two consecutive password change attempts. Value should be any positive interger or float.\n\nThe ``PasswordExpirationMiddleware`` class\n------------------------------------------\n\n``PasswordExpirationMiddleware``\n    Checks the user's password-changing records, if the user's password is expired, redirect the user to the password-changing form and shows a warning message.\n\n    This middleware works for any urls under the ``admin`` application namespace and redirects to the ``password_change`` url under the same namespace of the page which the user is redirected from. Urls not under the ``admin`` application namespace are not redirected.\n\n    The password expires in 90 days by default, and the number can be set by providing setting ``PASSWORD_EXPIRATION_DAYS`` to an integer or float value in ``settings.py``.\n",
