    "description": "Hey There!!!\n\nI'm C.Amrit Subramanian\nthe founder and author of this library\n\nLet me just elucidate you.. about why I was too keen on constructing this.\n\nFirstly..  I'm a student, currently pursuing higher education in Chennai, India... From Amrit Vidyalaya \n\nYep.. now hopefully, it's the right time to smash the reasons, why I manufactured this package.\n\nGetting your grooves under the category of python might be simple as proclaimed... But\nWhen it's time to deal with ridiculous challenges like writing files[i.e csv, txt & bin] via python, that's gonna make you run frenzy.\n\nWith all due respect, in order to terminate excessive stress and chores from a programmer's life, I conceived this package to make ends meet right and work well mostly, under various aspects and phases.\n\nIf you are craving to find a package that could chop off unnecessary lines of code from your tremendous, massive project... Hey, congrats you're at the right destination to achieve your horizon. This is my motto & would certainly try my best to enhance and amplify this library...\n\nThanks For Supporting...\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO ABIDE:\n\n    this package consists of 6 functions that you can import and implement\n\n    i]write_txt(filename, fillers)\n        ->this function help's you to create a txt file and append the elements you wanna, to the file you've provided.\n        ->have to enter the file name first.\n        ->then enter the string you wanna append in a single go.\n\n    ii]read_txt(filename, mode)\n        ->this function helps you read the txt file via the read function.\n        ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after the filename.\n\n    iii]write_csv(filename, total_columns, total_rows)\n        ->this function help's you to create a csv file and append the elements you wanna, to the file you've provided.\n        ->have to enter the file name first.\n        ->then enter the total number of columns you wanna have in your csv file.\n        -> enter 0 if you are gonna append to a csv file that already exists else print the no. of columns you wanna have to create a new csv file and write the columns in it.\n        ->then enter the total number of rows you wanna write to your csv file.\n\n    iv]read_csv(filename, mode)\n       ->this function helps you read the csv file list by list.. via reader function from csv.\n       ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after the filename.\n\n    v]write_bin(filename, *values)\n      ->this function helps you to create and append or direct append to a pickled binary file.\n      ->should first provide the file name you wanna create or append elements to.\n      ->then write elements one after another with commas separated.. elements might be of whatever datatype you wanna have.\n\n    vi]read_bin(filename, mode)\n       ->this function helps you to read a pickled binary file completely.\n       ->you should input p for printing the content or r for using the content for programming purposes in the function after the filename.\n\n    after downloading the library you should import it using this command: 'import macromrit' or 'from macromrit import <the function you want>'\n\nWHY IS THIS LIBRARY USEFUL & HANDY??:\n\n    _______________________________________________________________________\n\n    normal lines of code to write a txt file:\n\n        with open('filename.txt', 'a') as name:\n            print('hello world', file=name)\n\n    when you use this library to write a text file:\n\n        import macromrit\n        macromrit.write_txt('filename.txt', 'hello world')\n    _______________________________________________________________________\n\n    normal lines of code to write a csv file with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n\n        import csv\n\n        vals = [\n        ['name', 'phone'], \n        ['car', 'bike'], \n        ['cycle', 'scooter']\n        ]\n\n        with open('filename.csv', 'a', newline=\"\") as writer:\n            main = csv.writer(writer, delimiter=',')\n            main.writerow(['column1', 'column2'])\n            main.writerows(vals)\n\n    when you use this library to write a csv file with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n\n        import macromrit\n        macromrit.write_csv('filename.csv', 2, 3)\n    _______________________________________________________________________\n\n    normal lines of code to write a binary file with 5 elements:\n\n        import pickle\n\n        x=\"hello\"\n        y=\"hi\"\n        z=\"bye\"\n        a=\"clown\"\n        c=\"pen\"\n\n        with open('filename.bin', 'a') as writer:\n            pickle.dump(x, writer)\n            pickle.dump(y, writer)\n            pickle.dump(z, writer)\n            pickle.dump(a, writer)\n            pickle.dump(c, writer)\n\n    when you use this library to write a binary file with 5 elements:\n\n        import macromrit\n        macromrit.write_csv('filename.bin', \"hello\", \"hi\", 'bye', 'clown', 'pen')\n    _______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n## THANKS PYTHON ORGANISATION FOR MAKING MY DREAM COME TRUE ##\n\n##########################################################################\n\ncling me via instagram: https://www.instagram.com/amritsubramanian.c/\n\ncatch me through email: amritsubramanian.c@gmail.com\n\ngrab me on github: https://github.com/macromrit\n\n###########################################################################\n\n\nthanks for supporting :):):)\n\nAuthor & Founder of macromrit library |\nC.Amrit Subramanian |\na.k.a |\nMacromrit |\n\n",
