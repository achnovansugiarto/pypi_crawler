    "description": "# Farsight DNSDB Version 2 with Flexible Search SDK for Python\n\n[Farsight Security DNSDB®](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/) is the world’s largest DNS intelligence database that provides a unique, fact-based, multifaceted view of the configuration of the global Internet infrastructure. DNSDB leverages the richness of Farsight’s Security Information Exchange (SIE) data-sharing platform and is engineered and operated by leading DNS experts. Farsight collects Passive DNS data from its global sensor array. It then filters and verifies the DNS transactions before inserting them into the DNSDB, along with ICANN-sponsored zone file access download data. The end result is the highest-quality and most comprehensive DNS intelligence data service of its kind - with more than 100 billion DNS records since 2010.\n\nThis software development kit for Python 3 implements all features of the [DNSDB Version 2](https://docs.dnsdb.info/dnsdb-apiv2/) with Flexible Search API. \n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or greater.\n- [Python requests](http://python-requests.org).\n- [Requests mock](https://pypi.org/project/requests-mock/) for running the test suite.\n- A [DNSDB API key](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/).\n\nTo purchase DNSDB, please complete the [application form](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/order-form/). Our due diligence process requires that you provide answers for all required fields in the application. We must be able to positively establish your identity and projected use case, so your cooperation in completing this information will be greatly appreciated and expedite the approval process. Once your application is completed, Farsight Security will review and respond to your request within two business days.\n\nDNSDB Free 30-day Trial Key: Farsight’s [API Key portability program](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/trial-api/) lets you unlock the power of DNS intelligence across dozens of SIEM, Orchestration, Automation and Threat Intelligence Platforms that already support Farsight's DNSDB RESTful API. \n\n## Examples\n\nImport the dnsdb2 library and configure a client.\n\n```python\nimport dnsdb2\nclient = dnsdb2.Client(apikey, swclient=\"yourappname\", version=\"v0.0\")\n```\n\nPerform a flex regex search for `farsight`. This manually suppresses `QueryLimited` exceptions raised by the server if the query results exceed the row limited.\n\n```python\nresults = list(client.flex_rdata_regex('farsight', ignore_limited=True))\n```\n\nLookup rrsets for `*.dnsdb.info` with rrtype `A`. \n\n```python\nresults = list(client.lookup_rrset(\"*.dnsdb.info\", rrtype='A', ignore_limited=True))\n```\n\nSummarize rdata records for `104.244.14.0/24` seen within the past 90 days.\n\n```python\nresults = next(client.summarize_rdata_ip(\"104.244.14.0/24\", time_last_after=-60*60*24*90, ignore_limited=True))\n```\n\nIterate through a large result set by re-issuing queries with increasing offsets after `QueryLimited` is raised.\n\n```python\nlimit = 1000\noffset = 0\nresults = list()\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        for res in client.lookup_rrset(\"farsightsecurity.com\", limit=limit, offset=offset):\n            results.append(res)\n    except dnsdb2.QueryLimited:\n        offset += limit\n    else:\n        break\n```\n\n## API Documentation\n\nhttps://docs.dnsdb.info/dnsdb-apiv2/\n\nhttps://docs.dnsdb.info/dnsdb-flex/\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n* [Client](#dnsdb2.Client)\n  * [ping](#dnsdb2.Client.ping)\n  * [rate\\_limit](#dnsdb2.Client.rate_limit)\n  * [lookup\\_rrset](#dnsdb2.Client.lookup_rrset)\n  * [summarize\\_rrset](#dnsdb2.Client.summarize_rrset)\n  * [lookup\\_rdata\\_name](#dnsdb2.Client.lookup_rdata_name)\n  * [summarize\\_rdata\\_name](#dnsdb2.Client.summarize_rdata_name)\n  * [lookup\\_rdata\\_ip](#dnsdb2.Client.lookup_rdata_ip)\n  * [summarize\\_rdata\\_ip](#dnsdb2.Client.summarize_rdata_ip)\n  * [lookup\\_rdata\\_raw](#dnsdb2.Client.lookup_rdata_raw)\n  * [summarize\\_rdata\\_raw](#dnsdb2.Client.summarize_rdata_raw)\n  * [flex\\_rrnames\\_regex](#dnsdb2.Client.flex_rrnames_regex)\n  * [flex\\_rrnames\\_glob](#dnsdb2.Client.flex_rrnames_glob)\n  * [flex\\_rdata\\_regex](#dnsdb2.Client.flex_rdata_regex)\n  * [flex\\_rdata\\_glob](#dnsdb2.Client.flex_rdata_glob)\n* [DnsdbException](#dnsdb2.DnsdbException)\n* [AccessDenied](#dnsdb2.AccessDenied)\n* [OffsetError](#dnsdb2.OffsetError)\n* [QuotaExceeded](#dnsdb2.QuotaExceeded)\n* [ConcurrencyExceeded](#dnsdb2.ConcurrencyExceeded)\n* [QueryError](#dnsdb2.QueryError)\n* [QueryFailed](#dnsdb2.QueryFailed)\n* [QueryLimited](#dnsdb2.QueryLimited)\n* [QueryTruncated](#dnsdb2.QueryTruncated)\n* [ProtocolError](#dnsdb2.ProtocolError)\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.Client\"></a>\n### Client Objects\n\n```\n | dnsdb2.Client(apikey: str, server: str = 'https://api.dnsdb.info',\n |               swclient: str = 'dnsdb2-py', version: str = '0.0',\n |               proxies: Dict[str, str] = None, insecure: bool = False)\n |      A client for DNSDB protocol version 2 with Flex Search.\n |\n |      Args:\n |          apikey (str): A DNSDB API key\n |          server (str): The DNSDB API server endpoint\n |          swclient (str): The name of the client software reported to DNSDB.\n |          version (str): The version of the software reported to DNSDB.\n |          proxies (Dict[str, str]): HTTP proxies to use.

An owner name with a\n |              leading asterisk and label separator, (i.e., *.) will perform a\n |              wildcard search for any RRsets whose owner names end with the given\n |              domain name. An owner name with a trailing label separator and asterisk\n |              (i.e., .*) will perform a wildcard search for any RRsets whose owner\n |              names start with the given label(s). Note that left-hand wildcard\n |              queries are somewhat more expensive and slower than right-hand wildcard\n |              queries.\n |          rrtype (str): a DNS RRtype mnemonic.\n |      \n |          bailiwick (str): A DNS bailiwick in presentation format or wildcards.\n |          time_first_before (int): provide results before the defined timestamp for\n |              when the DNS record was first observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_first_before=1420070400” will only provide matching DNS records\n |              that were first observed before (or older than) January 1, 2015.\n |              \n |          time_first_after (int): provide results after the defined timestamp for when\n |              the DNS record was first observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_first_after=-31536000” will only provide results that were first\n |              observed within the last year.\n |              \n |          time_last_before (int): provide results before the defined timestamp for\n |              when the DNS record was last observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_last_before=1356998400” will only provide results for DNS records\n |              that were last observed before 2013.\n |              \n |          time_last_after (int): provide results after the defined timestamp for when\n |              the DNS record was last observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_last_after=-2678400” will only provide results that were last\n |              observed after 31 days ago.    \n |      \n |          limit (int): Limit for the number of results returned via these lookup\n |              methods. There is a built-in limit to the number of results that are\n |              returned via these lookup methods. The default limit is set at 10,000.\n |              This limit can be raised or lowered by setting the “limit” query\n |              parameter.\n |      \n |              There is also a maximum number of results allowed; requesting a limit\n |              greater than the maximum will only return the maximum. See results_max\n |              below for information on that maximum. If “?limit=0” is used then DNSDB\n |              will return the maximum number of results allowed. Obviously, if there\n |              are less results for the query than the requested limit, only the actual\n |              amount can be returned.\n |      \n |          id (str): Client software specific identity of the user of the API client.\n |              Comprised of an alphanumeric string, a colon, and an alphanumeric\n |              string, limited to thirty characters. This may be logged by the DNSDB\n |              API server.\n |      \n |          aggr (bool): Aggregated results group identical rrsets across all time\n |              periods and is the classic behavior from querying the DNSDB. This means\n |              you could get the total number of times an rrset has been observed, but\n |              not when it was observed. Unaggregated results ungroup identical rrsets,\n |              allowing you to see how the domain name was resolved in the DNS across\n |              the full-time range covered in DNSDB (subject to time fencing). This can\n |              give a more accurate impression of record request volume across time\n |              because it will reveal the distinct timestamps of records whose values\n |              are repeated. You can answer questions like, “Was a domain parked for a\n |              long time, mostly unused, until it was repurposed for serving malware or\n |              relaying spam, but then was abandoned again?” It allows you to see if a\n |              record was observed heavily in the last week vs. having been observed\n |              constantly for years.\n |      \n |          humantime (bool): A value that is True if time values (in time_first,\n |              time_last, zone_time_first, zone_time_last) should be returned in human\n |              readable (RFC3339 compliant) format or False if Unix-style time values\n |              in seconds since the epoch should be returned. False is the classic\n |              behavior from querying the DNSDB and is the default value for this\n |              option.\n |      \n |          ignore_limited(bool): Suppress QueryLimited exceptions.\n |      \n |          offset (int): How many rows to offset (e.g. skip) in the results.\n |              This implements an incremental result transfer feature, allowing you to\n |              view more of the available results for a single query. The rows are\n |              offset prior to the limit parameter being applied, therefore offset\n |              allows seeing additional results past a limit that matches the maximum\n |              number of results. Note that DNSDB recalculates the results for each\n |              query and the order of results might not be preserved. Therefore, this\n |              capability is not a valid way to walk all results over multiple queries\n |              – some results might be missing and some might be duplicated. The actual\n |              offset that can be used is limited or for certain API keys, offset is\n |              not allowed – see the offset_max rate_limit key below.\n```\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.Client.summarize_rrset\"></a>\n#### summarize\\_rrset\n\n```\n |  summarize_rrset = f(self, owner_name: str, rrtype: str = None, bailiwick: str = None, ignore_limited: bool = False, **params)\n |      Executes a summarize rrset query.\n |      \n |      Args:\n |          owner_name (str): A DNS owner name in presentation format or wildcards.\n |      \n |              Wildcards are one of two forms: a left-hand (*.example.com) or\n |              right-hand (www.example.*) wildcard domain name.

The actual\n |              offset that can be used is limited or for certain API keys, offset is\n |              not allowed – see the offset_max rate_limit key below.\n |      \n |          ignore_limited(bool): Suppress QueryLimited exceptions.\n```\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.Client.flex_rdata_glob\"></a>\n#### flex\\_rdata\\_glob\n\n```\nflex_rdata_glob = f(self, value: str, rrtype: str = None, verbose: bool = True, ignore_limited: bool = False, **params)\n |      Executes a glob rdata flex search query.\n |      \n |      Args:\n |          value (str): A glob to match against rdata.\n |          rrtype (str): a DNS RRtype mnemonic.\n |      \n |          verbose (bool): Set to false to disable `count`, `time_first`, and\n |              `time_last` fields in output.\n |          time_first_before (int): provide results before the defined timestamp for\n |              when the DNS record was first observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_first_before=1420070400” will only provide matching DNS records\n |              that were first observed before (or older than) January 1, 2015.\n |              \n |          time_first_after (int): provide results after the defined timestamp for when\n |              the DNS record was first observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_first_after=-31536000” will only provide results that were first\n |              observed within the last year.\n |              \n |          time_last_before (int): provide results before the defined timestamp for\n |              when the DNS record was last observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_last_before=1356998400” will only provide results for DNS records\n |              that were last observed before 2013.\n |              \n |          time_last_after (int): provide results after the defined timestamp for when\n |              the DNS record was last observed. For example, the URL parameter\n |              “time_last_after=-2678400” will only provide results that were last\n |              observed after 31 days ago.    \n |      \n |          exclude (str): Exclude (i.e. filter-out) results that match the glob.\n |          limit (int): Limit for the number of results returned via these lookup\n |              methods. There is a built-in limit to the number of results that are\n |              returned via these lookup methods. The default limit is set at 10,000.\n |              This limit can be raised or lowered by setting the “limit” query\n |              parameter.\n |      \n |              There is also a maximum number of results allowed; requesting a limit\n |              greater than the maximum will only return the maximum. See results_max\n |              below for information on that maximum. If “?limit=0” is used then DNSDB\n |              will return the maximum number of results allowed. Obviously, if there\n |              are less results for the query than the requested limit, only the actual\n |              amount can be returned.\n |      \n |          id (str): Client software specific identity of the user of the API client.\n |              Comprised of an alphanumeric string, a colon, and an alphanumeric\n |              string, limited to thirty characters. This may be logged by the DNSDB\n |              API server.\n |      \n |          offset (int): How many rows to offset (e.g. skip) in the results.\n |              This implements an incremental result transfer feature, allowing you to\n |              view more of the available results for a single query. The rows are\n |              offset prior to the limit parameter being applied, therefore offset\n |              allows seeing additional results past a limit that matches the maximum\n |              number of results. Note that DNSDB recalculates the results for each\n |              query and the order of results might not be preserved. Therefore, this\n |              capability is not a valid way to walk all results over multiple queries\n |              – some results might be missing and some might be duplicated. The actual\n |              offset that can be used is limited or for certain API keys, offset is\n |              not allowed – see the offset_max rate_limit key below.\n |      \n |          ignore_limited(bool): Suppress QueryLimited exceptions.\n```\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.DnsdbException\"></a>\n### DnsdbException Objects\n\n```python\nclass DnsdbException(Exception)\n```\n\nCommon base class for all DNSDB exceptions.\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.AccessDenied\"></a>\n### AccessDenied Objects\n\n```python\nclass AccessDenied(DnsdbException)\n```\n\nException raised if the API key is not authorized (usually indicates the\nblock quota is expired), or the provided API key is not valid, or the\nClient IP address not authorized for this API key.\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.OffsetError\"></a>\n### OffsetError Objects\n\n```python\nclass OffsetError(DnsdbException)\n```\n\nException raised if the offset value is greater than the maximum allowed\nor if an offset value was provided when not permitted.\n\n<a name=\"dnsdb2.QuotaExceeded\"></a>\n### QuotaExceeded Objects\n\n```python\nclass QuotaExceeded(DnsdbException)\n```\n\nException raised if you have exceeded your quota and no new requests will\nbe accepted at this time.\n\nFor time-based quotas : The API key’s daily quota limit is exceeded.
