The Visualisation is updated continuously and can be exited without interfering with the data\ntaking procedures.\n\n## Configuration options\nThe client software can be configured in two ways, the main method of configuration is a yaml config file. An example is provided in this repository\nand printed here for convenience:\n```\nbasic:\n  rise-time: 10\n  hold-time: 20\n  pulse-decay-time: 390\n  pulse-height-threshhold: 1000000\n\nenvironment:\n  server-ip: '192.168.0.2'\n  server-port: '8080'\n```\n\nThere is an advanced option available to override the internally calculated accumulation-time. To set this add the following section to the\nconfig file:\n```\nadvanced:\n  accumulation-time: 22\n```\n\nThe configuration options `rise-time`, `hold-time` and `pulse-decay-time` are the parameters of the trapezoidal filter. The `pulse-height-threshhold`\nis used to suppress small (and thus low energy) peaks and primarily acts to reduce noise, as the high frequency of the noise can overwhelm the filter.\n\nThe IP of server should not change through the course of a semester and the port only changes if explicitly set at server startup.\n\nThe accumulation-time is used to avoid counting one peak multiple times. It should only be set if there are major problems with the setup, as it is\nautomatically calculated from the `rise-time` and `hold-time` of the trapezoidal filter.\n\n## Behaviour of the Program\nThe server will stop sending events, if the FPGA-Internal hardware buffer overflows. This is an indicator, that the system as a whole is overwhelmed\nwith the number of events. As the buffer is only so large, the overflowing is poisson distributed. The larger the average event rate, the more likely\nit is for the buffer to overflow due to many events in short succession. If this happens within the first 5 minutes of the experiment, try increasing\nthe `pulse-height-threshhold` about 50000, this cuts more of the signal that is suspected to be noise and reduces the likelihood of the filter\noverflowing and the experiment being halted.\n\nTo restart the experiment, simply call `mb-client` again. The Red-pitaya will automatically reconfigure and start the next measurement.\n\nIn the (very rare) case where this does not happen, go to the ssh connection to the Red-pitaya and quit the server with `<Ctrl>C` then call the\n`./start_server.sh` again.\n\n## The program structure\nThe mbclient package consists of the cli application located at `cli.py` and associated functions in the `mbclient.py` file. The command line program\noperates asynchronously with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). There are a total of three tasks.\n1. The user facing task waits for a `stop` input from the user and sends a terminate signal to the other running tasks.\n2. The `process_data` task opens a websocket connection to the Red-Pitaya experiment, reads in the data from there and passes it along to 'consumer'\n   tasks.\n3. The `write_to_file` task writes the decoded data it receives from the task 2 and writes it into an csv file.\n4. The `plot_data` task starts a second process, that is responsible for 'live' plotting of the data and forwards the data to it via a PIPE.\n\nThe `mbdatatypes.py` file contains the Class that represents the result coming from the Red-Pitaya. It contains methods to decode the raw data from\nthe websocket and methods to transform the data read to a csv entry.\n\nThe `mbplotter.py` file contains the Class that is spawned off into the second process to plot the data, as well as a class that acts as an API for\nsending data to the plotting process via the `plot(data)` funciton. The characteristics and details of the plot are encoded in the `ProcessPlotter` class.\n\n## Notes on Matplotlib\nMatplotlib does quite a lot of things. One of them being the implementation of it's own event loop similar to the one used from asyncio. With the\nevent loop comes the ability to set a timer that fires a callback function that updates the plot. All this is implemented in the `ProcessPlotter`\nclass. The Pipe between the processes is used as a data buffer.\n\n\n\n",
