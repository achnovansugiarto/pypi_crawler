    "description": "These packages facilitate least-squares fitting of noisy data by\r\n    multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many\r\n    parameters. The central package is :mod:`lsqfit` which provides\r\n    the fitting capability. :mod:`lsqfit` makes heavy use of package\r\n    :mod:`gvar`, which provides tools for the analysis of error\r\n    propagation, and also for the creation of complicated\r\n    multi-dimensional gaussian distributions. :mod:`lsqfit` supports\r\n    Bayesian priors for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily\r\n    complicated multidimensional gaussian distributions. It uses\r\n    automatic differentiation to compute gradients, greatly simplifying\r\n    the design of fit functions.\r\n\r\n    These packages use the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) to do the\r\n    fitting, numpy for efficient array arithmetic, and cython to\r\n    compile efficient core routines and interface code.",
