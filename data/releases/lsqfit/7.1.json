    "description": "This package facilitates least-squares fitting of noisy data by\n    multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many\n    parameters. :mod:`lsqfit` provides the fitting capability;\n    it makes heavy use of package :mod:`gvar`, which provides tools for\n    the analysis of error propagation, and also for the creation of\n    complicated multi-dimensional gaussian distributions. (:mod:`gvar`\n    is distributed separately.) :mod:`lsqfit` supports Bayesian priors\n    for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily complicated multidimensional\n    Gaussian distributions. It uses automatic differentiation to compute\n    gradients, greatly simplifying the design of fit functions.\n\n    In addition to :mod:`gvar`, this package uses the Gnu Scientific\n    Library (GSL) to do the fitting, numpy for efficient array arithmetic,\n    and cython to compile efficient core routines and interface code.",
