    "description": "lsqfit\n------\n\nThis package facilitates least-squares fitting of noisy data by\nmulti-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many parameters.\n``lsqfit`` supports Bayesian priors for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily\ncomplicated multidimensional Gaussian distributions. A tutorial on fitting is\nincluded in the documentation; documentation is in the ``doc/``\nsubdirectory: see ``doc/html/index.html`` or <https://lsqfit.readthedocs.io>.\n\nThe fitter uses automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the fit\nfunction. This greatly simplifies coding of the fit function since only the\nfunction itself need be coded. Coding is also simplified by using dictionaries\n(instead of arrays) for representing fit data and fit priors.\n\n``lsqfit`` makes heavy use of Python package ``gvar``, which\nsimplifies the analysis of error propagation and the creation of\nmulti-dimensional Gaussian distributions (for fit priors).\n\nThis code has been used on a laptop to fit functions of tens-to-thousands of\nparameters to tens-to-thousands of pieces of data.  ``lsqfit`` uses the GNU\nScientific Library (GSL) and/or ``scipy`` to do the fitting, ``numpy`` for\nefficient array arithmetic, and ``cython`` to compile efficient code that\ninterfaces between Python and the C-based GSL.\n\nInformation on how to install the components is in the ``INSTALLATION`` file.\n\nTo test the libraries try ``make tests``. Some examples are give in the\n``examples/`` subdirectory.\n\nVersion numbers: Incompatible changes are signaled by incrementing\nthe ``major`` version number, where version numbers have the form\n``major.minor.patch``. The ``minor`` number signals new features, and the\n``patch`` number bug fixes.\n\n\n| Created by G. Peter Lepage (Cornell University) 2008\n| Copyright (c) 2008-2020 G.
