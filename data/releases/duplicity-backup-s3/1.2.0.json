The commands `incremental`, `list files`, `status`, `verify`, `cleanup`, `remove` and `init` are implemented.\n\nThe primary use case to build this (yet another one) CLI wrapper for duplicity, is to be able to deploy the command in production and inject it into a `cron.daily` and having a hands-off automated backup of production servers. We use it a KE-works to automate our production server backups to Amazon S3.\n\n## OS Dependencies\n\n- [duplicity](http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)\n- [python-boto](https://pypi.org/project/boto/) to connect to S3\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either install this as a system command on any operating system supporting Python 3.5 or later.\n\nTo install as global command from PyPI:\n\n```bash\nsudo python3 -m pip install duplicity-backup-s3\n```\n\nTo install for your user only from PyPI enter the following commmand:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install --user duplicity-backup-s3\n```\n\nTo install from the git repository (latest master branch):\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/jberends/duplicity_backup.git#wheel=duplicity_backup_s3\n```\n\n### First use\n\nTo first use, you need to create a configuration yaml file. You can use the helper command `init` for that. Use the built-in help function for your enjoyment.\n\n```bash\n# help is neigh\nduplicity_backup_s3 --help\n\n# and to init the configuration YAML file\nduplicity_backup_s3 init\n```\n\nIt will drop you a `duplicity_backup_s3.yaml` in your current directory. That may look like this:\n\n```yaml\naws:\n  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: foobar_aws_key_id  # your amazon S3 user that has write right to a backup bucket\n  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: foobar_aws_access_key  # your amazon S3 user secret\nbackuproot: /home  # the backup 'root' path. Everything underneath is considered for backup.\nexcludes:\n  - \"**\"  # a list of exclude paths. May be '**' to exclude everything except what you include\nincludes:\n  - /home/Pictures  # a list of includes, which are full paths\n  - /home/Music\nremote:\n  bucket: '<an_s3_bucket>'  # S3 bucket name\n  path: '__test'  # subpath within the bucket\nfull_if_older_than: 7D  # default is incremental, will create full backup every 7Days.\n```\n\nYou can alter the configuration file to your liking. The command will check the configuration for its validity and tell you what went wrong and what you need to correct. If you made mistakes, it can be beneficial to checkout the duplicity man page for more information on that topic. However we tried to be as verbose as possible to guide you in the right direction.\n\n### First backup\n\nTo perform your first backup, which is a full one, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nduplicity_backup_s3 incr --verbose\n\n# or if the config is somewhere else\nduplicity_backup_s3 incr --config /path/to/configuation.yaml\n```\n\nThat might take time according to the size of the backup.\nYou can see the volumes being uploaded to your configured [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) using the S3 console.\n\nTo check the backup collection, list and verify the contents of the backup you may use:\n\n```bash\n# collection status\nduplicity_backup_s3 status\n\n# list all files\nduplicity_backup_s3 list\n\n# verify backup\nduplicity_backup_s3 verify\n```\n\n### Remove old backups\n\nTo remove older backups, duplicity provides some commands. We implemented those in the `remove` command.\n\n```bash\n# to remove backups older than 7D\nduplicity_backup_s3 remove --older-than 7D\n\n# to remove older backup except the last 4 full backups\nduplicity_backup_s3 remove --all-but-n-full 4\n```\n\n### Restore backups\n\nTo restore backup we implemented the `restore` command.\n\n```bash\n# to restore backups from yesterday to a current directory\nduplicity_backup_s3 restore --time 1D\n\n# to restore specific subdirectory from a specific date/time to a custom directory\nduplicity_backup_s3 restore --dir specific_subdir \\\n    --time 2020-12-08T22:22:00+01:00 --target ~/a_restoredir\n```\n\n### Using this as daily backup in a cronjob\n\nTo use this in a daily cron job, you can alter the `crontab` for the user `root`\n\n```bash\ncrontab -u root -e\n```\n\nYou can alter the crontab in the following way\n\n```text\n# Daily backup and remove older backup\n7 4 * * * /bin/duplicity_backup_s3 incr --config=/path/to/conf.yaml && /bin/duplicity_backup_s3 remove --older-than 7D --config=/path/to/conf.yaml\n# | | | | +- the command to execute\n# | | | +--- day of the week (0-6) Sunday=0 (*=every day)\n# | | +----- month of the year (*=every month)\n# | +------- day of the month (*=every day)\n# +--------- hour of the day\n#----------- minute in the hour\n```\n\n## Custom Endpoints\n\nYou can configure custom endpoint and custom additional arguments in the configuration yaml file. The custom endpoint can be configured in the section `remote > uri` and the additional arguments that are directly passed to duplicity can be configurated in the `extra_args` section as a list in the yaml file.\n\n```yaml\n...\nremote:\n    uri: \"s3://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/bucketname/subpath\"\nextra_args:\n    - --some\n    - --additional\n    - --arguments\n    - --here=3\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] implement appdirs for default configuration file placement\n- [x] implement restore for restoring\n- [x] Allow for custom s3 storage endpoints. Included in v1.2.0 with thanks to @denismatveev\n- [x] If requested migrate `--s3-european-buckets` to configuration file\n- [x] If requested implement GPG/Encryption capabilities. Possibly reusing code of `kecpkg-tools` to manage certificates. Included in v1.2.0 with thanks at @denismatveev\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- This package was inspired by the great work done by the duplicity team, back in the days.\n- This package was inspired by the great amount of bash code by the [duplicity_backup.sh](https://github.com/zertrin/duplicity-backup.sh) project.\n- This package is thankful on my knees to the great work done by the Authors and contributors behind the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) project, packing tons of CLI awesomeness since 2014.\n- This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.\n\\n\\n# Changelog\n\n## v1.2.0 (23JAN23)\n\nThis release is named \"The Other S3 As Well\"-Release. We now support other S3 storage providers, other than only the Amazon one. So now you can use digitalocean (tested) or even dropbox for that matter as a remote storage for your backups.\n\n* :star: Added the option `extra_args` in the configuration yaml. These `extra_args` may be provided as a list in the yaml and they are passed down to duplicity. See the duplicity documentation for the exact use of them. (#8)\n* :star: Added the option to provide the full remote uri in the yaml section `remote > uri`. This will circumvent the construction of the uri based on endpoint, bucket and path and ensures that when you know what you are doing a lot of different storage providers may be used. See the duplicity help documentation how to provide the remote uri correctly. (#8)\n* :star: Added GPG encryption possibilities. Thanks to @denismatveev. (#5)\n* :star: Added the ability to use custom S3 endpoints. Now it does not default to amazon S3 and you can use S3 compatible storage targets such as digitalocean (tested on Digital Ocean). Thanks to @denismatveev. (#5)\n* :+1: Improved `init` command to add a flag `--quiet` for less chatty way of initialisation of the config file. (#8)\n* :+1: Thorough spring cleanup. Dropped support for Python releases below 3.7. `Black`-ened, `pyupgrade`-ed, `isort`-ed the codebase. Fixed tests and added tests for newer python releases. Switched to dependabot for dependency management.  (#8)\n\n## v1.1.0 (8DEC20)\n\n* added restore command implementation.\n\n## v1.0.2 (3APR20)\n\n* Added appdirs to the setup.py requirements.\n\n## v1.0.1 (UNRELEASED)\n\nNot released to the public.\n\n## v1.0.0 (16DEC19)\n\nFirst production release.\n\n* implemented appdirs, such that the configuration file can be safely placed and located from a known configuration directory on disk.\n* added `remove` command to remove collections from the backup target after a specified time. Please consult the `duplicity_backup_s3 remove --help` documentation for guidance.\n* added `init` command to initialise the configuration in an interactive fashion for users.\n* various development improvements, e.g. GitHub actions for testing and publishing to PyPI; removed all flake8 warnings and pydocstyle errors. Added pre-commit hooks. Code is A++ grade now.\n\n## v0.5.0 (5JUN19)\n\nFirst initial public release.\n\n* commands `incr`, `list`, `status`, `verify`, `cleanup` implemented.\n* added yaml schema check for the configuration file.\n\n## v0.2.0 (3JUN19)\n\nInternal release.\n\n* migrated to command structure. Now offers `incr` and `init`\n\n## v0.1.0 (3JUN19)\n\nInternal release.\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n\n\n",
