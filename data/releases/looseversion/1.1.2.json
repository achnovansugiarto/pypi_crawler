    "description": "# looseversion - Version numbering for anarchists and software realists\n\nA backwards/forwards-compatible fork of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`,\nfor times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.\n\nThe goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original `LooseVersion`.\nIt implements an identical interface and comparison logic to `LooseVersion`.\nThe only major change is that a `looseversion.LooseVersion` is comparable to a\n`distutils.version.LooseVersion`, which means tools should not need to worry whether\nall dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.\n\nIf you are simply comparing versions of Python packages, consider moving to\n[packaging.version.Version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.Version),\nwhich follows [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440).\n`LooseVersion` is better suited to interacting with heterogeneous version schemes that\ndo not follow PEP-440.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From PyPI\n\n```\npip install looseversion\n```\n\n### From source\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/effigies/looseversion.git\npip install looseversion/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```Python\n>>> from looseversion import LooseVersion\n>>> LooseVersion(\"1.0.0\") < LooseVersion(\"2.0.0\")\nTrue\n>>> LooseVersion(\"1.0.0\") < \"2\"\nTrue\n```\n",
