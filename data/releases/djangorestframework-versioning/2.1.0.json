    "description": "# Django REST Framework Versioning\n\nThis project aims to make it easy to support many different API versions in a Django REST Framework (DRF) project.\n\nDRF [supports several versioning schemes](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/) but (perhaps wisely) sidesteps the issue of how to actually deal with the different versions in your code. To quote the docs: \"How you vary the API behavior is up to you\".\n\nThis project provides some out-of-the box tools to handle versioning in views and serializers. The aim is to abstract away any versioning logic into a sort of \"versioning layer\" and allow the bulk of the code (and its developers) to focus on the latest behaviour.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see the full documentation [here](https://binnev.github.io/djangorestframework_versioning/).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe approach taken in this project was inspired by Stripe's API version \"compatibility layer\", as described in blog posts by [Brandur Leach](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning) and [Amber Feng](https://amberonrails.com/move-fast-dont-break-your-api). I used [Ryan Kaneshiro's](https://rescale.com/blog/api-versioning-with-the-django-rest-framework/) excellent Django sketch as a starting point.\n\nI also want to thank my colleagues at [Tranzer](https://www.tranzer.com) for encouraging me to work on this, and for being my guinea pigs / code duckies ❤️\n",
