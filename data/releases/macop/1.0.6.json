Continuous optimisation can also applicable if needed. The objective is to allow a user to exploit the basic structure proposed by this package to solve a problem specific to him. The interest is that he can quickly abstract himself from the complications related to the way of evaluating, comparing, saving the progress of the search for good solutions but rather concentrate if necessary on his own algorithm. Indeed, `Macop` offers the following main and basic features: \n\n- **solutions:** representation of the solution ;\n- **validator:** such as constraint programmig, a `validator` is function which is used for validate or not a solution data state ;\n- **evaluator:** stores problem instance data and implement a `compute` method in order to evaluate a solution ;\n- **operators:** mutators, crossovers update of solution ;\n- **policies:** the way you choose the available operators (might be using reinforcement learning) ;\n- **algorithms:** generic and implemented optimisation research algorithms ;\n- **callbacks:** callbacks to automatically keep track of the search space advancement.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/jbuisine/macop/blob/master/docs/source/_static/documentation/macop_behaviour.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\">\n</p>\n\nBased on all of these generic and/or implemented functionalities, the user will be able to quickly develop a solution to his problem while retaining the possibility of remaining in control of his development by overloading existing functionalities if necessary.\n\nMain idea about this Python package is that it does not implement the whole available algorithms in the literature but let the possibility to the user to quickly develop and test its own algorithms and strategies. The main objective of this package is to be the most flexible as possible and hence, to offer a maximum of implementation possibilities.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFully documentation of package with examples is [available](https://jbuisine.github.io/macop). \n\nYou can also see examples of use:\n-  in the [knapsackExample.py](https://github.com/jbuisine/macop/blob/master/examples/knapsackExample.py) python file for mono-objective.\n-  in the [knapsackMultiExample.py](https://github.com/jbuisine/macop/blob/master/examples/knapsackMultiExample.py) python file for multi-objective.\n\n## Add as dependency\n\n```bash\ngit submodule add https://github.com/jbuisine/macop.git\n```\n\n## License\n\n[The MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n",
