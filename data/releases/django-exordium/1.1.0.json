    "description": "========\nExordium\n========\n\nExordium is a read-only web-based music library system for Django.\nExordium will read mp3 and ogg files from the host filesystem and provide\nan online interface to browse, download (as zipfiles or otherwise), and\nstream.\n\nThe HTML5 media player `jPlayer <http://jplayer.org/>`_ is used to provide\narbitrary streaming of music.\n\nExordium was built with a very specific set of operational goals and does\nnot attempt to be a generic library suitable for widespread use.  There are,\nin fact, no configuration options beyond those to define the file paths/URLs\nnecessary for basic usage.  Patches to add/change functionality will be\nhappily received so long as they don't interfere with or disable the current\nfunctionality by default, but there is no internal development goal to make\nExordium a generic solution.\n\nDetailed information about what Exordium expects from your library, and its\nassumptions and limitations, can be found either in the ``docs/`` directory,\n`Exordium's Website <http://apocalyptech.com/exordium>`_, or\n`exordium.readthedocs.io <http://exordium.readthedocs.io/>`_.  It's\nhighly recommended to at least glance through these to get a feel for how\nExordium will function.\n\nThe name \"Exordium\" comes from the fictional technology of the same name in\nAlastair Reynolds' \"Revelation Space\" novels.  It's not a perfect name for\nthe app, given that the Revelation Space *Exordium* would make a pretty\nlousy music library, but at least there's some element of data storage and\nretrieval.  Exordium the *web-based music library*, as opposed to its\nfictional counterpart, is only capable of retrieving music which has been\nimported to it in the past.  I'll be sure to contact all the major news\norganizations if I figure out a way to get it to retrieve music stored in the\nfuture.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nExordium requires at least Python 3.4 *(tested in 3.4 and 3.5)*,\nand Django 1.10.\n\nExordium requires the following additional third-party modules:\n\n- mutagen (built on 1.34.1)\n- Pillow (built on 3.3.1)\n- django-tables2 (built on 1.2.5)\n- django-dynamic-preferences (built on 0.8.2), which in turn requires:\n\n  - six (built on 1.10.0)\n  - persisting_theory (built on 0.2.1)\n\nGetting Exordium\n----------------\n\nExordium is available to install on PyPI via ``pip install django-exordium``.\nPyPI also hosts Python packages for Exordium in both source and\n`Wheel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_ formats, at \nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-exordium/.  Source and Wheel downloads\nof all released versions can also be found at Exordium's hompeage at\nhttp://apocalyptech.com/exordium/.\n\nExordium sourcecode is hosted at `GitHub <https://github.com/apocalyptech/exordium/>`_,\nand sourcecode archives of released versions can be found there at\nhttps://github.com/apocalyptech/exordium/releases\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThese instructions assume that you already have a Django project up and\nrunning.\n\n1. Install Exordium via ``pip install django-exordium``\n\n   - If Exordium hasn't been installed via ``pip`` or some other method which\n     automatically installs dependencies, install its dependencies::\n\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n2. Add exordium, django_tables2, and dynamic_preferences to your\n   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting like this::\n\n     INSTALLED_APPS = [\n         ...\n         'exordium',\n         'django_tables2',\n         'dynamic_preferences',\n     ]\n\n3. Include the exordium URLconf in your project ``urls.py`` like this::\n\n     url(r'^exordium/', include('exordium.urls')),\n\n4. Run ``python manage.py migrate exordium`` to create the Exordium models.\n\n5. Run ``python manage.py migrate dynamic_preferences`` to create the\n   Dynamic Preferences models, if this wasn't already configured on your\n   Django install.\n\n6. Run ``python manage.py loaddata --app exordium initial_data`` to load\n   some initial data into the database.  *(This is not actually strictly\n   speaking necessary - the app will create the necessary data\n   automatically if it's not found.)*\n\n7. If running this from a \"real\" webserver, ensure that it's configured\n   to serve Django static files. Then run ``python manage.py collectstatic``\n   to get Exordium's static files in place.\n\n8. Either start the development server with ``python manage.py runserver``\n   or bring up your existing server.  Also ensure that you have a webserver\n   configured to allow access directly to your music library files, and \n   optionally to the zipfile downloads Exordium will create.\n\n9. Visit the administrative area in *Dynamic Preferences > Global preferences*\n   and set the values for the following:\n\n   - **Exordium Library Base Path**: This is what defines where your music\n     library can be found on disk.\n   - **Exordium Media URL**: This is the base URL which provides direct\n     access to the files in your library.  Omit the trailing slash, though\n     things will probably work fine even if it's in there.  Without this\n     set properly, song download links will be broken and the streaming\n     player will not work properly.\n   - **Exordium Zip File Generation Path**: Path on the filesystem to store\n     zipfile album downloads.  This is the one location in which the user\n     running Django needs write access.\n   - **Exordium Zip File Retrieval URL**: This is the base URL providing\n     web access to that zipfile directory.\n\n   Without the last two options, Exordium will still function fine, but the\n   album-download button will not be rendered.  Exordium will also function\n   without the \"*Exordium Media URL*\" option being set properly, though\n   with the caveats mentioned above.\n\n10. If Zipfile downloads are configured, a process should be put into place\n    to delete the zipfiles after a period of time.  I personally use a cronjob\n    to do this::\n\n      0 2 * * * /usr/bin/find /var/audio/exordiumzips -type f -name \"*.zip\" -mtime +2 -print -exec unzip -v {} \\; -exec rm {} \\;\n\n11. Visit the **Library Upkeep** link from the Exordium main page and click on\n    \"Start Process\" to begin the initial import into Exordium!",
