    "description": "Lightweight Personal Blog Maker\n===============================\n\nThis project aims to provide an easy way to generate static blog and personal\nwebsite using python scripts. Every page of the site is written using markdown,\nto help formatting easily text.\n\nThis project is still under heavy development, and a lot of things aren't\nfixed yet (meaning configuration file can change rapidly and often, for\nexample). Don't use it right now if you are not willing to spend some time fix\nthings between big updates.\n\nThis file only contains the minimum you need to know to install LPBM. A more\ndetailed documentation is provided in `doc/` directory, as a sphinx\ndocumentation.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* LPBM is split in several sub-modules. Including configuration management,\n  articles management, authors management and blog generation.\n* You only need to know markdown to write articles. Every meta-data is stored\n  in ini files, meaning you can manage them with any CVS.\n* You can have any number of authors on articles, and any number of categories.\n* Simple code embedding into articles. (using pygments).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nLPBM will soon be packaged with setup.py and PKGBUILD, and I will put it in AUR\ntoo, when it will be ready for a Release Candidate.\n\n### Install LPBM as a script.\n\nFor know, you can just clone this repository and link `~/.local/bin/lpbm` to\nthe lpbm.py file. Then you add `$HOME/.local/bin/` to your `PATH` environment\nvariable and you can execute LPBM everywhere.\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nYou also must install `python` version 3, `pip` for python version 3 and all\nthe python library dependencies. To do this, you just have to execute `pip\ninstall -r requirements.txt` and you'll have everything you need.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThere will be a detailed description of all the features and the usage of all\ncommands in the sphinx documentation in `doc/` directory.\n\nOther information\n-----------------\n\n### Authors (v2)\n\n* [Franck Michea](http://blog.kushou.eu/)\n\n### Authors (v1)\n\n* [Franck Michea](http://blog.kushou.eu/)\n* [Pierre Bourdon](http://blog.delroth.net/)\n\n### LPBM generates this blog:\n\n* [LSE Blog](http://blog.lse.epita.fr/)\n\n### Useful Links\n\n* [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n* [Code Embedding](http://packages.python.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html)\n* [LPBM Documentation](http://kushou.eu/lpbm-doc/)\n",
