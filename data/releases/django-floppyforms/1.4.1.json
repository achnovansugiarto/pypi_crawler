Oh well... Please Report. Or better, fix :) We are happy to help you\nthrough the process of fixing and testing a bug. Just get in touch.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThanks for asking!\n\nGet the code::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:gregmuellegger/django-floppyforms.git\n    cd django-floppyforms\n    virtualenv -p python2 env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    add2virtualenv .\n\nInstall the development requirements::\n\n    pip install \"tox>=1.8\"\n\nRun the tests::\n\n    tox -e py27-16\n\nYou can see all the supported test configurations with ``tox -l``.\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n1.4.1\n~~~~~\n\n* Fixed source distribution to include all files in\n  ``floppyforms/static/floppyforms/openlayers``.\n\n1.4.0\n~~~~~\n\n* Every widget is now using its own template. Previously all widgets that are\n  based on the HTML ``<input>`` tag used the generic ``floppyforms/input.html``\n  template. Now the widgets each have a custom element for easier\n  customisation. For example ``CheckboxInput`` now uses\n  ``floppyforms/checkbox.html`` instead of ``floppyforms/input.html``. See\n  `Widgets reference\n  <http://django-floppyforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/widgets-reference.html>`_\n  for a complete list of available widgets and which templates they use.\n\n* Adjusting the SRIDs used in the GeoDjango widgets to conform with\n  Django 1.7. Thanks to Tyler Tipton for the patch.\n\n* Python 3.2 is now officially supported.\n\n* Django 1.8 is now officially supported. django-floppyforms no longers\n  triggers Django deprecation warnings.\n\n* Adding `OpenLayers`_ distribution to django-floppyforms static files in order\n  to better support HTTPS setups when GIS widgets are used (See #15 for more\n  details).\n\n* Fix: ``python setup.py bdist_rpm`` failed because of wrong string encodings\n  in setup.py. Thanks to Yuki Izumi for the fix.\n\n* Fix: The ``CheckboxInput`` widget did detect different values in Python 2\n  when given ``'False'`` and ``u'False'`` as data. Thanks to @artscoop for the\n  patch.\n\n* Fix: ``MultipleChoiceField`` can now correctly be rendered as hidden field by\n  using the ``as_hidden`` helper in the template. That was not working\n  previously as there was no value set for ``MultipleChoiceField.hidden_widget``.\n\n.. _OpenLayers: http://openlayers.org/\n\n1.3.0\n~~~~~\n\n* DateInput widget renders hardcoded \"%Y-%m-%d\" format. We don't allow custom\n  formats there since the \"%Y-%m-%d\" format is what browsers are submitting\n  with HTML5 date input fields. Thanks to Bojan Mihelac for the patch.\n\n* Adding ``supports_microseconds`` attribute to all relevant widget classes.\n  Thanks to Stephen Burrows for the patch.\n\n* Using a property for ``Widget.is_hidden`` attribute on widgets to be in\n  conformance with Django 1.7 default widget implementation.\n\n* The docs mentioned that the current ``ModelForm`` behaviour in\n  ``floppyforms.__future__`` will become the default in 1.3. This is postpone\n  for one release and will be part of 1.4.\n\n1.2.0\n~~~~~\n\n* Subclasses of ``floppyforms.models.ModelForm`` did not convert widgets of\n  form fields that were automatically created for the existing model fields\n  into the floppyform variants. This is now changed, thanks to a patch by\n  Stephen Burrows.\n\n  Previously you had to set the widgets your self in a model form. For example\n  you would write::\n\n    import floppyforms as forms\n\n    class ProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):\n        class Meta:\n            model = Profile\n            widgets = {\n                'name': forms.TextInput,\n                'url': forms.URLInput,\n                ...\n            }\n\n  Now this is done automatically. But since this is a kind-of\n  backwardsincompatible change, you need to use a special import::\n\n    import floppyforms.__future__ as forms\n\n    class ProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):\n        class Meta:\n            model = Profile\n\n  This feature will become the default behaviour in floppyforms 1.4.\n\n  See the documentation for more information:\n  http://django-floppyforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html#modelforms\n\n* If you added an attribute with value 1 to the attrs kwargs (e.g. ``{'value':\n  1}``, you would get no attribute value in the rendered html (e.g. ``value``\n  instead of ``value=\"1\"``). That's fixed now, thanks to Viktor Ershov for the\n  report.\n\n* All floppyform widget classes now take a ``template_name`` argument in the\n  ``__init__`` and ``render`` method. Thanks to Carl Meyer for the patch.\n\n1.1.1\n~~~~~\n\n* Fix for Django 1.6\n\n* Fix for GIS widgets on Django 1.4 and some versions of GEOS.\n\n1.1\n~~~\n\n* Added GenericIPAddressField.\n\n* Django 1.5 and Python 3.3 support added.\n\n* Django 1.3 support dropped.\n\n* GIS widgets switched to stable OpenLayers release instead of a dev build.\n\n* Fixed ``Textarea`` widget template to work with a non-empty\n  ``TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID`` setting. Thanks to Leon Matthews for the\n  report.\n\n* Fixed context handling in widget rendering. It didn't take care of popping\n  the context as often as it was pushed onto. This could cause strange\n  behaviour in the template by leaking variables into outer scopes. Thanks to\n  David Danier for the report.\n\n* Added missing empty choice for selectboxes in ``SelectDateWidget``. Thanks\n  fsx999 for the report.\n\n* ``IntegerField`` now automatically passes its ``min_value`` and\n  ``max_value`` (if provided) to the ``NumberInput`` widget.\n\n* Added basic support for ``<datalist>`` elements for suggestions in\n  ``Input`` widgets.\n\n* ``date``, ``datetime`` and ``time`` inputs are not localized anymore. The\n  HTML5 spec requires the rendered values to be RFC3339-compliant and the\n  browsers are in charge of localization. If you still want localized\n  date/time inputs, use those provided by Django or override the\n  ``_format_value()`` method of the relevant widgets.\n\n1.0\n~~~\n\n* cleaned up the behaviour of ``attrs``\n* compatible with Django 1.3 and 1.4\n* ``<optgroup>`` support in select widgets\n* ``Select`` widgets: renamed ``choices`` context variable to ``optgroups``.\n  This is **backwards-incompatible**: if you have custom templates for\n  ``Select`` widgets, they need to be updated.\n* ``get_context()`` is more reliable\n* Added ``form``, ``formrow``, ``formfield``, ``formconfig`` and ``widget``\n  template tags.\n* Added template-based form layout system.\n* Added ability to render widgets with the broader page context, for\n  instance for django-sekizai compatibility.\n\n0.4\n~~~\n\n* All widgets from Django have their floppyforms equivalent\n* Added widgets for GeoDjango",
