    "description": "|Build Status|\n\nman\n===\n\n``man`` is a software distribution tool that works over setuptools and\nhelp integerate PyPi, Travis, Github and You together. This lets you\ncreate a python library and have it deployed in less than ten minutes.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nCreation\n~~~~~~~~\n\nSay that you have an idea of a new library that you would like to share\nwith other on PyPi. You know python, you use github and you don't want\nto spend hours struggling in the mess of package distribution.\n\nThus, just install ``man``:\n\n::\n\n    pip install man \n\nNOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to install ``pyreadline``\nwith ``pip install pyreadline``.\n\nAnd create a new library:\n\n::\n\n    man new-lib\n\nThen answer the short questions about your library:\n\n::\n\n    Name of your library:\n    Short description:\n    Keywords (space separated): \n    Full name:\n    E-Mail:\n    Github username:\n    PyPi username:\n\nIf you don't already have a PyPi account, you need to `create\none <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form>`__.\n\nThen you will be prompted for your github password to create a new\nrepository with the name of your lib.\n\nThen you just need to: - Setup Travis: - `create an\naccount <https://travis-ci.org/>`__ - Find your repo at\nhttps://travis-ci.org/profile/YOURNAME and turn the switch on. - Add\nyour travis password to the .travis.yml: - Open ``bash`` - And just run\n``travis encrypt --add deploy.password`` - And type your travis password\n- Add classifiers (or tags) for your library so people can find it more\neasily, run ``man add tag`` - Write your code, do commits, tests and\nwhatever you want. - Complete the readme.md (not the readme.rst, because\nit is always converted from the readme.md.)\n\nFirst release\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the version of your code is ``0.0.0``. I choose to use the simple\n``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` system as it's easy to use, understand and work\nwith.\n\nWhen you are ready for your first release, type\n\n::\n\n    man release major\n\nEnter a description of your first release (it can be more than one line)\nand confirm that you want to create a new release. Your code is then\ntaged with ``v1.0.0``, and that will trigger a Travis build and\ndeployment on PyPi. You can go on\n`travis-ci.org <https://travis-ci.org/>`__\\ and when everything is\nfinished, type:\n\n::\n\n    pip install my-new-lib\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nAnd after\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThen, everytime you add functionalities or correct bugs and you want to\nshare them just type one of the following:\n\n::\n\n    man release patch  # When you just fix broken things\n    man release minor  # when you add functionnality\n    man release major  # when you do big changes (maybe not backward compatible)\n\nAll commands are well described, so try to run them with the ``--help``\nflag to see what ``man`` can do.\n\nList of commands:\n-----------------\n\nId there is a tilde (``~``) after a command, there is an interactive\nprompt disponible, with autocompletion.\n\n``man`` - ``add`` - ``keywords [KW1] [KW2] ...`` -\n``package [PATH_TO_PKG]`` - ``dependancy [LIBRARY] [VERSION]`` ~ -\n``script`` ~ - ``tag`` ~ - ``remove`` - ``keywords`` ~ -\n``package [PKG_NAME]`` ~ - ``dependancy [LIBRARY]`` ~ -\n``script [NAME]`` ~ - ``tag`` ~ - ``release [major|minor|patch]`` -\n``--test`` - ``--again`` - ``new [DESTINATION_DIR]`` ~ - ``changelog`` -\n``-v`` / ``--verbose`` - ``config`` ~ - See the ``pyconfiglib``\n`reference <https://github.com/ddorn/pyconfiglib>`__. - ``gen`` -\n``readme.rst`` - ``setup.py`` - ``MANIFEST.in``\n\n--------------\n\nBy Diego Dorn\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/ddorn/man.svg?branch=v1.5.1\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/ddorn/man",
