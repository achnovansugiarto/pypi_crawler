The solution implemented here is to have a remote master list whose definitions are propagated to LookML. Thus, given some remote definition for a given LookML `dimension`, `dimension_group`, or `measure`, inject it in the LookML.\n\nFull documentation is [here](README_UPDATER.md).\n\n\n## LookML linter\nThe second tool helps us check that our LookML conforms to some given coding standards and LookML developer best practices. It runs a series of checks over our LookML files and reports which `files`, or which `dimensions`, `dimension_groups`, or `measures`, fail those checks.\n\nFull documentation is [here](README_LINTER.md).\n\n## LookML grapher\nThe third tool creates a \"network diagram\" of the `model - explore - view` relationships and writes to an `PNG` image file. The code will also identify any `orphans` i.e. views not referenced by any models or explores.\n\nFull documentation is [here](README_GRAPHER.md).\n\n## Installation\n\nAll three tools above makes use of Fabio's node-based LookML parser (https://github.com/fabio-looker/node-lookml-parser)\n\n```\nbrew install node   # if on mac\nnpm install -g lookml-parser\n```\n\nYou will need to set the path of the `lookml-parser` binary in the config file. For example, for the updater config, your path might be:\n\n```\n{\n    \"parser\": \"/usr/local/bin/lookml-parser\",\n    \"tmp_file\": \"parsed_lookml.json\",\n    \"definitions\": {\n        \"type\": \"CsvDefinitionsProvider\",\n        \"filename\": \"definitions.csv\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### pip\nYou can install the Python codebase of `lookml-tools` via pip:\n\n```\n  pip install lookml-tools\n```\n\nYou may need to install its dependencies:\n```\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Unit tests\nThere is a test suite with close to 100% code coverage\n\nRun with \n\n```\npip install pytest-cov\n\npython -m pytest --cov=lkmltools/ test/*.py ; coverage html\n```\n\nImportantly, as this code relies on an external node utility (`lookml-parser`), one that might not be installed, and one that could be installed but whose behavior might change compared to today,\n\n - the unit tests are set to check that it is installed (`test/test_prequisites.py`)\n - the unit tests use a cached and checked in parsed lookml file (`test/parsed_minimal_multiline_lookml.json`) and check that parsing the same input file produces the same output as that cached version (see `test/test_lookml_modifier`.`test_get_json_representation`).\n\n This should provide confidence that this core-functionality parser is working as expected.\n\n## Developer Notes\nThere are some developer notes for the linter [here](README_DEVELOPER.md).\n\n## Contribute\nWe would love to have your feedback, suggestions, and especially contributions to the project.
