    "description": "Prolog\n======\n\nDjango IS Core is a lightweight framework built on Django. It augments Django great design patterns and minimizes\nannoying programming work. It takes best from Django-admin. ISCore provides a simple way how to build a rich\nadministration. It is very simlar to Django admin but there are several differences that justifies why IS Core is\ncreated.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* same detail/add/table views as Django admin, but it uses REST and AJAX call to achieve it (it adds easier usage and\nbroaden usability)\n* it can be used for creation only REST resources without UI\n* models UI (add/detail) is more linked together, links between foreign keys are automatically added\n* it provides more posibilities for read-only fields (e.g. the fields defined only inside form can be readonly too)\n* add new custom view is for Django admin is nightmare, with IS Core is very easy\n* it uses class based views, it is cleaner and changes are simplier\n* add new model administration without its registration\n* generated forms from models with validations\n* generated REST resources from models again with validations (no code duplication)\n* automatic exports to XLSX, PDF, CSV can be very simply add to a table view\n* automatic filtering and sorting for list views\n* pre-built reusable views and forms\n* automatic CRUD views for models (with REST resources)\n* authorization (token based) and permissions\n* advanced permissions (e.g. a link between objects is not added to UI if a user does not have permissions to see it)\n* and much more ...\n\nDocs\n----\n\nFor more details see [docs](http://django-is-core.readthedocs.org/)\n\n\nContribution\n------------\n\nTo run Livereload for Sphinx you need [livereload](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/livereload) `pip install livereload`.\nAfter installing simply call `make htmllivereload` and open [http://localhost:5500/](http://localhost:5500/).",
