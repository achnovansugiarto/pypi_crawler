Current contains ``YES``,\n``NO``, ``QUIT``, ``ALL``, and ``NONE``. ``YES`` and ``ALL`` are \"truth-y\"\nwhile ``NO``, ``QUIT``, and ``NONE`` are \"false-y\".\n\n\nAvailable Commands\n------------------\n\nlength_no_ansi(mystring)\n````````````````````````\nTakes a string, strips out the ANSI escape codes\n(used for colouring terminal output, etc.), and returns\nthe length of the resulting string\n\ncentered (mystring, linewidth=None, fill=\" \")\n`````````````````````````````````````````````\nTakes a string, centres it, and pads it on both sides. Default ``linewidth`` is\none less than the console width.\n\nclock_on_right(mystring)\n````````````````````````\nTakes a string, and prints it with the time right aligned\n\nquery_yes_no(question, default=\"yes\")\n`````````````````````````````````````\nAsk a yes/no question via raw_input() and return their answer.\n\n- \"question\" is a string that is presented to the user.\n- \"default\" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>. It must be\n  \"yes\" (the default), \"no\" or None (meaning an answer is required of the\n  user).\n- Returns one of Answer.YES or Answer.NO\n\nquery_yes_no_all(question, default=\"yes\")\n`````````````````````````````````````````\nAsk a yes/no/all question via raw_input() and return their answer.\n\n- \"question\" is a string that is presented to the user.\n- \"default\" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>. It must be\n  \"yes\" (the default), \"no\", \"all\" or None (meaning an answer is required of\n  the user).\n- Returns one of Answer.YES, Answer.NO, or Answer.ALL\n\ndef query_yes_quit(question, default=\"quit\")\n````````````````````````````````````````````\nAsk a yes/quit question via raw_input() and return their answer.\n\n- \"question\" is a string that is presented to the user.\n- \"default\" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>.

It must be\n  \"yes\" (the default), \"no\", \"all\", \"none\" (i.e. the string) or None (meaning\n  an answer is required of the user).\n- Returns one of Answer.YES, Answer.NO, Answer.ALL, or Answer.NONE\n\nwait(sec)\n`````````\nPrints a timer with the format 0:00 to the console,\nand then clears the line when the timer is done.\n\ntitle(mytitle)\n``````````````\nTakes ``mytitle``, centers it, and prints it in yellow letters on a blue\nbackground.\n\nsubtitle(mysubtitle)\n````````````````````\nTakes ``mysubtitle``, centers it, and prints it in bright (white) letters on a\nnormal (black) background.\n\nrainbow_print(text, offset=0)\n`````````````````````````````\nPrints out ``text`` in a cycle of rainbow-esque colors!\n\n\nprogressbar (class)\n-------------------\n\nThis class is used to create and then update a 'progress bar', like:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    [================>                                                    ] 17 / 70\n\n\nprogressbar(current=0, maximum=100, bar_color=colorama.Fore.GREEN)\n``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\nCreates a progress bar class.
