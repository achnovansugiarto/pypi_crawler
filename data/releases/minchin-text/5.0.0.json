It must be \"yes\" (the default), \"no\" or None (meaning an answer is required of the user).\n - The \"answer\" return value is one of \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nquery_yes_no_all(question, default=\"yes\")\n`````````````````````````````````````````\nAsk a yes/no/all question via raw_input() and return their answer.\n\n - \"question\" is a string that is presented to the user.\n - \"default\" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>. It must be \"yes\" (the default), \"no\", \"all\" or None (meaning an answer is required of the user).\n - The \"answer\" return value is one of \"yes\", \"no\", or \"all\".\n\ndef query_yes_quit(question, default=\"quit\")\n````````````````````````````````````````````\nAsk a yes/quit question via raw_input() and return their answer.\n\n - \"question\" is a string that is presented to the user.\n - \"default\" is the presumed answer if the user just hits <Enter>. It must be \"yes\" (the default), \"quit\" or None (meaning an answer is required of the user).\n - The \"answer\" return value is one of \"yes\" or \"quit\".\n\nwait(sec)\n`````````\nPrints a timer with the format 0:00 to the console,\nand then clears the line when the timer is done.\n\ntitle(mytitle)\n``````````````\nTakes 'mytitle', centers it, and prints it in yellow letters on a blue background.\n\n\nsubtitle(mysubtitle)\n````````````````````\nTakes 'mysubtitle', centers it, and prints it in bright (white) letters on a normal (black) background.\n\nprogressbar (class)\n-------------------\n\nThis class is used to create and then update a 'progress bar', like:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n    [================>                                                      ] 17 / 70\n\n\nprogressbar(current=0, maximum=100, bar_color=colorama.Fore.GREEN)\n``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\nCreates a progress bar class. Prints the progress bar.\n\nprogressbar.update(currently=None)\n``````````````````````````````````\nUpdates the value of the progress bar and prints it.\n\nprogressbar.reset()\n```````````````````\nSets the value of the progress bar to 0 (zero) and prints it.\n\nCode\n----\n\nThe code is available at https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.text\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\nTests\n-----\nLocated in the `test` folder. Each is a \"visual test\", so they need to be run and the output manually examined.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe code is licensed under the MIT license. See that attached `LICENSE` file.\n\n\nv 5.0 [2015-06-10]\n==================\n - move package to `minchin.text`\n - add tests for `minchin.text.centered()`\n - add end character to progress bar\n - add documentation to README.rst\n\nv 4.4 [2014-10-26]\n==================\n - typographic changes to allow wmtext to work in Python 3\n\nv 4.1 [2014-03-10]\n==================\n - allow access as a direct object.   \n     i.e. use `import wmtext` rather than `from wmtext import wmtext`\n\nv 4.0 [2014-02-06]\n==================\n - packaged as a separate module\n - added progress bar\n - first public release\n \nv 3.2 [2014-02-02]\n==================\n - add `length_no_ansi()` allowing you to determine the length of a string\n     after stripping out ANSI codes.",
