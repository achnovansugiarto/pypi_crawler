In other words, an instance represents the *output column* of a `truth table <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table>`__ for a function (under the assumption that the input vectors to which each output value corresponds are sorted in ascending order). Thus, each instance representing a function that accepts ``n`` inputs must have length ``2**n``.\n\nFor example, consider the truth table below for a boolean function *f* that accepts three inputs:\n\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n| *x* | *y* | *z* | *f* (*x*, *y*, *z*) |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  0  |  0  |  0  | 1                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  0  |  0  |  1  | 0                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  0  |  1  |  0  | 1                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  0  |  1  |  1  | 0                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  1  |  0  |  0  | 0                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  1  |  0  |  1  | 1                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  1  |  1  |  0  | 1                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n|  1  |  1  |  1  | 0                   |\n+-----+-----+-----+---------------------+\n\nNotice that the input vectors (*i.e.*, the left-most three column values in each row) are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom. If we always assume this order for input vectors, the entire function *f* can be represented using the right-most column. For the example function *f* defined by the table above, this can be done in the manner illustrated below::\n\n    >>> from logical import *\n    >>> f = logical((1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)) \n\nIt is then possible to `apply <https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.__call__>`__ the instance ``f`` defined above to any three-component input vector::\n\n    >>> f(0, 1, 1)\n    0\n    >>> f(1, 1, 0)\n    1\n\n.. |call| replace:: ``__call__``\n.. _call: https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.__call__\n\nIt is also possible to create a new |logical|_ instance that has a ``function`` attribute corresponding to a `compiled Python function <https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.compiled>`__ that has the same behavior as the |call|_ method (at least, on valid inputs). This Python function does not check that inputs are of the correct type and format, but has an execution time that is usually at most half of the execution time of the |call|_ method::\n\n    >>> f = logical((1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))\n    >>> g = f.compiled()\n    >>> g.function(0, 0, 0)\n    1\n    >>> g.function(1, 1, 0)\n    0\n\nPre-defined instances are provided for all nullary, unary, and binary boolean functions. These are available both as constants and as attributes of the |logical|_ class::\n\n    >>> logical.xor_(1, 0)\n    1\n    >>> and_(1, 0)\n    0\n\n.. |nullary| replace:: ``nullary``\n.. _nullary: https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.nullary\n\n.. |unary| replace:: ``unary``\n.. _unary: https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.unary\n\n.. |binary| replace:: ``binary``\n.. _binary: https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.binary\n\nThe constants |nullary|_, |unary|_, and |binary|_ are also defined. Each is a set containing exactly those instances of |logical|_ that represent functions having that arity::\n\n    >>> unary\n    {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)}\n    >>> len(binary)\n    16\n\n.. |every| replace:: ``every``\n.. _every: https://logical.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/_source/logical.html#logical.logical.logical.every\n\nFor convenience, the constant |every|_ is defined as the union of |nullary|_, |unary|_, and |binary|_.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\nAll installation and development dependencies are fully specified in ``pyproject.toml``. The ``project.optional-dependencies`` object is used to `specify optional requirements <https://peps.python.org/pep-0621>`__ for various development tasks. This makes it possible to specify additional options (such as ``docs``, ``lint``, and so on) when performing installation using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`__::\n\n    python -m pip install .[docs,lint]\n\nDocumentation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe documentation can be generated automatically from the source files using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__::\n\n    python -m pip install .[docs]\n    cd docs\n    sphinx-apidoc -f -E --templatedir=_templates -o _source .. && make html\n\nTesting and Conventions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`__ (see the ``pyproject.toml`` file for configuration details)::\n\n    python -m pip install .[test]\n    python -m pytest\n\nAlternatively, all unit tests are included in the module itself and can be executed using `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`__::\n\n    python src/logical/logical.py -v\n\nStyle conventions are enforced using `Pylint <https://pylint.pycqa.org>`__::\n\n    python -m pip install .[lint]\n    python -m pylint src/logical\n\nContributions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIn order to contribute to the source code, open an issue or submit a pull request on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/reity/logical>`__ for this library.\n\nVersioning\n^^^^^^^^^^\nThe version number format for this library and the changes to the library associated with version number increments conform with `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200>`__.\n\nPublishing\n^^^^^^^^^^\nThis library can be published as a `package on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/logical>`__ by a package maintainer. First, install the dependencies required for packaging and publishing::\n\n    python -m pip install .[publish]\n\nEnsure that the correct version number appears in ``pyproject.toml``, and that any links in this README document to the Read the Docs documentation of this package (or its dependencies) have appropriate version numbers. Also ensure that the Read the Docs project for this library has an `automation rule <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automation-rules.html>`__ that activates and sets as the default all tagged versions. Create and push a tag for this version (replacing ``?.?.?`` with the version number)::\n\n    git tag ?.?.?\n    git push origin ?.?.?\n\nRemove any old build/distribution files. Then, package the source into a distribution archive::\n\n    rm -rf build dist src/*.egg-info\n    python -m build --sdist --wheel .\n\nFinally, upload the package distribution archive to `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__::\n\n    python -m twine upload dist/*\n",
