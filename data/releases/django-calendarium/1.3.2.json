    "description": "Django Calendarium\n==================\n\nA Django application for managing and displaying a calendar and its events.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor further information, like requirements, please check out the\n[django-calendarium documentation](https://django-calendarium.readthedocs.org/)\non readthedocs.\n\n![Calendar Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitmazk/django-calendarium/master/calendar_view.png \"Calendar Example\")\n\n\nWe added some basic bootstrap styles to start with. If you're not using\nBootstrap we recommend to build your own styles, otherwise try:\n\n```html\n{% load static %}\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static \"calendarium/css/bootstrap.min.css\" %}\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static \"calendarium/css/calendar.css\" %}\">\n```\n\n\nSettings\n--------\n\nIf you want your calendar to start on a different date, you can set the\n``CALENDARIUM_SHIFT_WEEKSTART`` setting to be the offset in days, that the\ncalendar should add or subtract from the start day of the week. Most common\ncase is probably, that you want your calendar week to start on sunday in which\ncase you would add the following to your settings::\n \n```python\nCALENDARIUM_SHIFT_WEEKSTART = -1\n```\n\nExtending the app\n-----------------\n\nIt is almost inevitable that you will want to add more fields or more\nfunctionality to the Event model of this app. However, this app is already\nquite complex and we would like to keep it as simple and focused as possible.\nThis app should do one thing and do it well, and that thing is: to output\n(recurring) events for a given day, week, month or timeframe.\n\nA very common usecase is to display public events that are open for\nregistration. For this case we have created another app [django-event-rsvp](https://github.com/bitmazk/django-event-rsvp) which plays nicely with this app.\n\nYou might do it in a similar way. Since events created in the calendarium app\ncan easily be tied to any object via generic foreign keys, you can therefore\ntie them to the objects of any of your own apps. The only thing left for you is\nto create nice CRUD views that create your own objects and our Event objects\nsimultaneously behind the scenes.\n\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nCheck the issue tracker on github for milestones and features to come. If you\nhave ideas or questions, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the issue\ntracker.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\n    py\\dj   |  1.5  |  1.6  |  1.7  |  1.8  |\n    -----------------------------------------\n    2.6     |   X   |   X   |   X   |   X   |\n    2.7     |   X   |  PASS |  PASS |  PASS |\n    3.2     |   X   |  PASS |  PASS |  PASS |\n    3.4     |  PASS |  PASS |  PASS |  PASS |\n    -----------------------------------------\n",
