    "description": "=====================\ndjango-storages-redux\n=====================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jschneier/django-storages-redux.png?branch=master\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/jschneier/django-storages-redux\n\n\nAbout\n=====\ndjango-storages was (is) a project to provide a variety of storage backends in\na single library. This is its maintained, Python 3 compatible fork. The reasons\nfor the fork are given in the next section.\n\nAt the moment the only tested Python 3 comptaible backend is the S3 Boto one\nbut some of them should work without issue (hashpath, symlink, overwrite).\n\nThis library maintains compatibility for all currently supported versions of\nDjango.\n\nWhy Fork?\n=========\nThe BitBucket repo of the original django-storages has seen no commit applied\nsince March 2014 (it is currently December 2014) and no PyPi release since\nMarch 2013 despite a wealth of bugfixes that were applied in that year-long\ngap. There is plenty of community support for the django-storages project\n(especially the S3BotoStorage piece) and I have a personal need for a Python3\ncompatible version.\n\nAll of the Python3 comptaible forks that currently exist (and there are a few)\nare lacking in some way. This can be anything from the fact that they don't\nrelease to PyPi, have no ongoing testing, didn't apply many important bugfixes\nthat have occurred on the bitbucket repo since forking or don't support older\nversions of Python and Django (vital to finding bugs and keeping a large\ncommunity). For this fork I've done the small bit of work necessary to get a\ntox + travis ci matrix going for all of the supported Python + Django versions.\nIn many cases the various forks are lacking in a few of the above ways.\n\nFound a Bug? Something Unspported?\n==================================\nI suspect that a few of the storage engines in backends/ have been unspported\nfor quite a long time. I personally only really need the S3Storage backend but\nwelcome bug reports (and especially) patches and tests for some of the other\nbackends.\n\nIssues are tracked via GitHub issues at the `project issue page\n<https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/issues>`_.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nThe original documentation for django-storages is located at http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/.\nStay tuned for forthcoming documentation updates.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\n#. `Check for open issues\n   <https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/issues>`_ at the project\n   issue page or open a new issue to start a discussion about a feature or bug.\n#. Fork the `django-storages-redux repository on GitHub\n   <https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux>`_ to start making changes.\n#. Add a test case to show that the bug is fixed or the feature is implemented\n   correctly.\n#. Bug me until I can merge your pull request. Also, don't forget to add\n   yourself to ``AUTHORS``.\n\n\n\ndjango-storages-redux change log\n================================\n\n1.2 (2014-12-14)\n******************\n\n* Add text/javascript mimetype to S3BotoStorage gzip allowed defaults\n* Add support for Django 1.7 migrations in S3BotoStorage `#5`_ and ApacheLibCloudStorage `#8`_\n* Python3K (3.3+) now available for S3Boto backend `#4`_\n* Remove legacy S3 storage - fixes `#1`_\n* Remove mosso files backend - fixes `#2`_\n\n.. _#8: https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/pull/8\n.. _#5: https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/pull/5\n.. _#4: https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/pull/4\n.. _#1: https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/issues/1\n.. _#2: https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages-redux/issues/2\n\n\n**NOTE**: Version 1.1.9 is the first release of django-storages-redux after the fork.\nIt represents the current (2014-12-08) state of the original django-storages in\nmaster with no additional changes.
