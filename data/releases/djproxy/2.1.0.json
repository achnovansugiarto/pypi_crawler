Use your web server's proxy capabilities in the wild. If you need\nto use this in production for some reason, it should be sufficiently performant\nas long as the upstream responses aren't large. Performance can be further\nincreased by aggressively caching upstream responses.\n\nNote that djproxy doesn't currently support websockets.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install djproxy\n```\n\ndjproxy requires requests >= 1.0.0 and django >= 1.4.0.\n\n## Usage\n\nStart by defining a new proxy:\n\n```python\nfrom djproxy.views import HttpProxy\n\nclass LocalProxy(HttpProxy):\n    base_url = 'https://google.com/'\n```\n\nAdd a url pattern that points at your proxy view. The `url` kwarg will be\nurljoined with base_url:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns(\n    '',\n    url(r'^local_proxy/(?P<url>.*)$', LocalProxy.as_view(), name='proxy')\n)\n```\n\n`/local_proxy/some/content` will now proxy `https://google.com/some/content/`.\n\n\n### HttpProxy configuration:\n\n* `base_url`: The proxy url is formed by\n   `urlparse.urljoin(base_url, url_kwarg)`\n* `ignored_upstream_headers`: A list of headers that shouldn't be forwarded\n  to the browser from the proxied endpoint.\n* `ignored_request_headers`: A list of headers that shouldn't be forwarded\n  to the proxied endpoint from the browser.\n* `proxy_middleware`: A list of proxy middleware to apply to request and\n  response data.\n* `pass_query_string`: A boolean indicating whether the query string should be\n  sent to the proxied endpoint.\n* `reverse_urls`: An iterable of location header replacements to be made on\n  the constructed response (similar to Apache's `ProxyPassReverse` directive).\n* `verify_ssl`: This option corresponds to [requests' verify parameter][1]. It\n  may be either a boolean, which toggles SSL certificate verification on or off,\n  or the path to a CA_BUNDLE file for private certificates.\n\n## Adjusting location headers (ProxyPassReverse)\n\nApache has a directive called `ProxyPassReverse` that makes replacements to\nthree location headers: `URI`, `Location`, and `Content-Location`. Without this\nfunctionality, proxying an endpoint that returns a redirect with a `Location`\nheader of `http://foo.bar/go/cats/` would cause a downstream requestor to be\nredirected away from the proxy. djproxy has a similar mechanism which is\nexposed via the `reverse_urls` class variable. The following proxies are\nequivalent:\n\nDjproxy:\n\n```python\n\nclass ReverseProxy(HttpProxy):\n    base_url = 'https://google.com/'\n    reverse_urls = [\n        ('/google/', 'https://google.com/')\n    ]\n\nurlpatterns = patterns(\n    '',\n    url(r'^google/(?P<url>.*)$', ReverseProxy.as_view(), name='gproxy')\n\n```\n\nApache:\n\n```\n<Proxy https://google.com/*>\n    Order deny,allow\n    Allow from all\n</Proxy>\nProxyPass /google/ https://google.com/\nProxyPassReverse /google/ https://google.com/\n```\n\n### HttpProxy dynamic configuration and route generation helper:\n\nIf you'd like to specify the configuration for a set of proxies, without\nhaving to maintain specific classes and url routes, you can use\n`djproxy.helpers.generate_routes` as follows:\n\nIn `urls.py`, pass `generate_routes` a `configuration` dict to configure a set\nof proxies:\n\n```python\nfrom djproxy.urls import generate_routes\n\nconfiguration = {\n    'test_proxy': {\n        'base_url': 'https://google.com/',\n        'prefix': '/test_prefix/',\n    },\n    'service_name': {\n        'base_url': 'https://service.com/',\n        'prefix': '/service_prefix/',\n        'verify_ssl': False,\n        'append_middlware': ['myapp.proxy_middleware.add_headers']\n    }\n}\n\nurlpatterns += generate_routes(configuration)\n```\n\nUsing the snippet above will enable your Django app to proxy\n`https://google.com/X` at `/test_prefix/X` and\n`https://service.com/Y` at `/service_prefix/Y`.\n\nThese correspond to the following production Apache proxy configuration:\n```\n<Proxy https://google.com/*>\n    Order deny,allow\n    Allow from all\n</Proxy>\nProxyPass /test_prefix/ https://google.com/\nProxyPassReverse /test_prefix/ https://google.com/\n\n\n<Proxy https://service.com/*>\n    Order deny,allow\n    Allow from all\n</Proxy>\nProxyPass /service_prefix/ http://service.com/\nProxyPassReverse /service_prefix/ http://service.com/\n```\n\n`verify_ssl`  and `csrf_exempt` are optional (and default to True), but\nbase_url and prefix are required.\n\n`middleware` and `append_middleware` are also optional. If neither are present,\nthe default proxy middleware set will be used. If middleware is specified,\nthen the default proxy middleware list will be replaced. If\nappend_middleware is specified, the list will be appended to the end of\nthe middleware set. Use `append_middleware` if you want to add additional\nproxy behaviors without modifying the default behaviors.\n\n## Proxy middleware\n\nHttpProxys support custom middleware for preprocessing data from downstream\nto be sent to upstream endpoints and for preprocessing response data before\nit is sent back downstream. `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`,\n`X-Forwarded-Proto` and the `ProxyPassRevere` functionality area all implemented\nas middleware.\n\nHttProxy views are configured to execute particular middleware by setting\ntheir `proxy_middleware` attribute. The following HttpProxy would attach XFF and\nXFH headers, but not preform the ProxyPassReverse header translation or attach\nan XFP header:\n\n```python\nclass ReverseProxy(HttpProxy):\n    base_url = 'https://google.com/'\n    reverse_urls = [\n        ('/google/', 'https://google.com/')\n    ]\n    proxy_middleware = [\n        'djproxy.proxy_middleware.AddXFF',\n        'djproxy.proxy_middleware.AddXFH'\n    ]\n```\n\nIf you need to write your own middleware to modify content, headers, cookies,\netc before the content is sent upstream of if you need to make similar\nmodifications before the content is sent back downstream, you can write your own\nmiddleware and configure your view to use it. djproxy contains a [middleware\ntemplate][2] to help you with this.\n\n## Terminology\n\nIt is important to understand the meaning of these terms in the context of this\nproject:\n\n**upstream**: The destination that is being proxied.\n\n**downstream**: The agent that initiated the request to djproxy.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo run the tests, first install the dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you'd like to test this against a version of Django other than 1.5, wipe out\nthe 1.5 installation from `requirements.txt` by installing the desired version.\n\nRun `nosetests` to execute the test suite.\n\nTo automatically run the test suite, flake8, frosted, and pep257 checks whenever\npython files change use testtube by executing `stir` in the top level djproxy\ndirectory.\n\nTo run a Django dev server that proxies itself, execute the following:\n\n```\ndjango-admin.py runserver --settings=tests.test_settings --pythonpath=\"./\"\n```\n\nSimilarly, to run a configure Django shell, execute the following:\n\n```\ndjango-admin.py shell --settings=tests.test_settings --pythonpath=\"./\"\n```\n\nSee `tests/test_settings.py` and `tests/test_urls.py` for configuration\ninformation.\n\n[1]:http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/?highlight=verify#ssl-cert-verification\n[2]:https://github.com/thomasw/djproxy/blob/master/djproxy/proxy_middleware.py#L32\n",
