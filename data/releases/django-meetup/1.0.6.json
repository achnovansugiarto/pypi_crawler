    "description": "Django-Meetup\n=============\n\nThis is a general purpose django-app for syncing Meetup.com to a local database and adding Meetup.com content to a website.\n\nThis was specifically designed to put events for one Meetup.com group onto their independent website. However, it was designed to give flexibility to the developer for whatever Meetup.com content syncing and posting they wish. \n\nTo use\n------\n\nInstall via pip\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install django-meetup\n\nAdd to your Django settings module the following variables\n\n.. code-block:: python \n    \n    THIRD_PARTY_APPS = [ \n        ...,\n        \"meetup\",\n        ...,\n    ]\n    \n    MEETUP_KEY = \"\"\n    \n    # **Security Warning:** Keep personal Meetup api key secret.\n    # Read `Meetup documentation <https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/>`_.\n    \n    MEETUP_GROUP_ID = 123456789\n    \n    # (optional) This is the default group id to get information fro      \n        \n    MEETUP_ALLOW_ADMIN = True\n\n    # (optional) This boolean will set up admin interface. \n    # **WARNING:** Methods to sync TO Meetup have not been completed. \n    #    So any changes to the database are local.\n \n    TIME_ZONE = \"UTC\"\n    \n    # (optional) This key is standard Django. The meetup package stores times \n    # in \"UTC\" but methods to view the time will set to TIME_ZONE as the default\n    # for that view \n    \n\nTo sync group events \n--------------------\n\nTo sync up a group, from the command line run\n    \n.. code-block:: bash    \n    \n    py manage.py sync_group_events <group_id>\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\n`Meetup.com <https://www.meetup.com>`_. provides an api which a Meetup.com member can access via `api.meetup.com <https://api.meetup.com>`_..\n\nThis package implements a MeetupClient which uses a meetup member's `meetup api key <https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/>`_.. The client can query the meetup api and get back dictionaries of \"meetup data\". Note that member permissions on Meetup.com apply to the members api queries.\n\nModels made to mimic hypothesized meetup.com database tables can take the client's data and turn them into local database objects.\n\nThe developer can then use the models to post information onto their webpage.\n\nTo contribute\n-------------\n\nIf you have methods or modifications which refine this package please contribute via `github astrodsg/django-meetup <https://github.com/astrodsg/django-meetup.git>`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2014, Dylan Gregersen\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\n  other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the Dylan Gregersen, SLC Python nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
