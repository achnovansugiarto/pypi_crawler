    "description": "DyNet\n=====\n\nThe Dynamic Neural Network Toolkit\n\nDyNet (formerly known as `cnn <http://github.com/clab/cnn-v1>`__) is a\nneural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many\nothers. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python) and is designed\nto be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU, and to work well with\nnetworks that have dynamic structures that change for every training\ninstance. For example, these kinds of networks are particularly\nimportant in natural language processing tasks, and DyNet has been used\nto build state-of-the-art systems for `syntactic\nparsing <https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser>`__, `machine\ntranslation <https://github.com/neubig/lamtram>`__, `morphological\ninflection <https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans>`__, and many other\napplication areas.\n\nRead the `documentation <http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to\nget started, and feel free to contact the `dynet-users\ngroup <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dynet-users>`__ group\nwith any questions (if you want to receive email make sure to select\n\"all email\" when you sign up). We greatly appreciate any bug reports and\ncontributions, which can be made by filing an issue or making a pull\nrequest through the `github page <http://github.com/clab/dynet>`__.\n\nYou can also read more technical details in our `technical\nreport <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03980>`__.
