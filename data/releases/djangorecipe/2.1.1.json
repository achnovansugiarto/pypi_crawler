    "description": "Djangorecipe: easy install of Django with buildout\n==================================================\n\nWith djangorecipe you can manage your django site in a way that is familiar to\nbuildout users. For example:\n\n- ``bin/django`` to run django instead of ``bin/python manage.py``.\n\n- ``bin/test`` to run tests instead of ``bin/python manage.py test yourproject``.\n\n- ``bin/django`` automatically uses the right django settings. So you can have\n  a ``development.cfg`` buildout config and a ``production.cfg``, each telling\n  djangorecipe to use a different django settings module. ``bin/django`` will\n  use the right setting automatically, no need to set an environment variable.\n\nDjangorecipe is developed on github at\nhttps://github.com/rvanlaar/djangorecipe, you can submit bug reports there. It\nis tested with travis-ci and the code quality is checked via landscape.io:\n\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvanlaar/djangorecipe.png?branch=master\n   :target: http://travis-ci.org/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/\n\n.. image:: https://landscape.io/github/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/master/landscape.svg?style=flat\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/master\n   :alt: Code Health\n\n\n\nSetup\n-----------\n\nYou can see an example of how to use the recipe below with some of the most\ncommon settings::\n\n    [buildout]\n    show-picked-versions = true\n    parts =\n        django\n    eggs =\n        yourproject\n        gunicorn\n    develop = .\n    # ^^^ Assumption: the current directory is where you develop 'yourproject'.\n    versions = versions\n\n    [versions]\n    Django = 1.8.2\n    gunicorn = 19.3.0\n\n    [django]\n    recipe = djangorecipe\n    settings = development\n    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}\n    project = yourproject\n    test = yourproject\n    script-with-settings = gunicorn\n    # ^^^ This line generates a bin/gunicorn-with-settings script with\n    # the correct django environment settings variable already set.\n\n\nEarlier versions of djangorecipe used to create a project structure for you,\nif you wanted it to. Django itself generates good project structures now. Just\nrun ``bin/django startproject <projectname>``. The main directory created is\nthe one where you should place your buildout and probably a ``setup.py``.\n\nStartproject creates a ``manage.py`` script for you. You can remove it, as the\n``bin/django`` script that djangorecipe creates is the (almost exact)\nreplacement for it.\n\nSee django's documentation for `startproject\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startproject>`_.\n\nYou can also look at `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/>`_.\n\n\n\nSupported options\n-----------------\n\nThe recipe supports the following options.\n\nproject\n  This option sets the name for your project.\n\nsettings\n  You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with\n  this option. This is useful if you want to have a different\n  production setup from your development setup. It defaults to\n  `development`.\n\ntest\n  If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a\n  specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to\n  the list of app labels which you want to be tested. Normally, it is\n  recommended that you use this option and set it to your project's name.\n\nscripts-with-settings\n  Script names you add to here (like 'gunicorn') get a duplicate script\n  created with '-with-settings' after it (so:\n  ``bin/gunicorn-with-settings``). They get the settings environment variable\n  set. At the moment, it is mostly useful for gunicorn, which cannot be run\n  from within the django process anymore. So the script must already be passed\n  the correct settings environment variable.\n\n  **Note**: the package the script is in must be in the \"eggs\" option of your\n  part. So if you use gunicorn, add it there (or add it as a dependency of\n  your project).\n\neggs\n  Like most buildout recipes, you can/must pass the eggs (=python packages)\n  you want to be available here. Often you'll have a list in the\n  ``[buildout]`` part and re-use it here by saying ``${buildout:eggs}``.\n\nThe options below are for older projects or special cases mostly:\n\ndotted-settings-path\n  Use this option to specify a custom settings path to be used. By default,\n  the ``project`` and ``settings`` option values are concatenated, so for\n  instance ``myproject.development``. ``dotted-settings-path =\n  somewhere.else.production`` allows you to customize it.\n\nextra-paths\n  All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python\n  path for the `bin/*` scripts. Use this if you have code somewhere without a\n  proper ``setup.py``.\n\ncontrol-script\n  The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the\n  equivalent of the `manage.py` Django normally creates. By default it\n  uses the name of the section (the part between the `[ ]`). Traditionally,\n  the part is called ``[django]``.\n\ninitialization\n  Specify some Python initialization code to be inserted into the\n  `control-script`. This functionality is very limited. In particular, be\n  aware that leading whitespace is stripped from the code given.\n\nwsgi\n  An extra script is generated in the bin folder when this is set to\n  `true`. This is mostly only useful when deploying with apache's\n  mod_wsgi. The name of the script is the same as the control script, but with\n  ``.wsgi`` appended. So often it will be ``bin/django.wsgi``.\n\nwsgi-script\n  Use this option if you need to overwrite the name of the script above.\n\ndeploy_script_extra\n  In the `wsgi` deployment script, you sometimes need to wrap the application\n  in a custom wrapper for some cloud providers. This setting allows extra\n  content to be appended to the end of the wsgi script. For instance\n  ``application = some_extra_wrapper(application)``. The limits described\n  above for `initialization` also apply here.\n\ntestrunner\n  This is the name of the testrunner which will be created. It\n  defaults to `test`.\n\n\nExample configuration for mod_wsgi\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to deploy a project using mod_wsgi you could use this\nexample as a starting point::\n\n    <Directory /path/to/buildout>\n         Order deny,allow\n         Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80>\n         ServerName      my.rocking.server\n         CustomLog       /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/access.log combined\n         ErrorLog        /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/error.log\n         WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/buildout/bin/django.wsgi\n    </VirtualHost>\n\nCorner case: there is a problem when several wsgi scripts are combined in a\nsingle virtual host instance of Apache. This is due to the fact that Django\nuses the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. This variable gets set\nonce when the first wsgi script loads. The rest of the wsgi scripts will fail,\nbecause they need a different settings modules. However the environment\nvariable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is only set once. The new `initialization`\noption that has been added to djangorecipe can be used to remedy this problem\nas shown below::\n\n    [django]\n    settings = acceptance\n    initialization =\n        import os\n        os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '${django:project}.${django:settings}'\n\n\nGenerating a control script for PyDev\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRunning Django with auto-reload in PyDev requires adding a small snippet\nof code::\n\n  import pydevd\n  pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)\n\njust before the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` in the `manage.py` module (or in\nthis case the control script, normally ``bin/django``, that is generated). The\nfollowing example buildout generates two control scripts: one for command-line\nusage and one for PyDev, with the required snippet, using the recipe's\n`initialization` option::\n\n    [buildout]\n    parts = django pydev\n    eggs =\n        mock\n\n    [django]\n    recipe = djangorecipe\n    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}\n    project = dummyshop\n\n    [pydev]\n    <= django\n    initialization =\n        import pydevd\n        pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)\n\n\nExample usage of django-configurations\n--------------------------------------\n\ndjango-configurations (http://django-configurations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\nis an application that helps you organize your Django settings into classes.\nUsing it requires modifying the manage.py file.  This is done easily using the\nrecipe's `initialization` option::\n\n    [buildout]\n    parts = django\n    eggs =\n        hashlib\n\n    [django]\n    recipe = djangorecipe\n    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}\n    project = myproject\n    initialization =\n        # Patch the manage file for django-configurations\n        import os\n        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')\n        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_CONFIGURATION', 'Development')\n        from configurations.management import execute_from_command_line\n        import django\n        django.core.management.execute_from_command_line = execute_from_command_line\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n\n2.1.1 (2015-06-15)\n------------------\n\n- Bugfix: ``script-entrypoints`` entry point finding now actually works.\n\n\n2.1 (2015-06-15)\n----------------\n\n- Renamed ``script-entrypoints`` option to ``scripts-with-settings``. It\n  accepts script names that would otherwise get generated (like ``gunicorn``)\n  and generates a duplicate script named like ``bin/gunicorn-with-settings``.\n\n  Technical note: this depends on the scripts being setuptools \"console_script\n  entrypoint\" scripts.\n\n\n2.0 (2015-06-10)\n----------------\n\n- Removed project generation. Previously, djangorecipe would generate a\n  directory for you from a template, but Django's own template is more than\n  good enough now. Especially: it generates a subdirectory for your project\n  now. Just run ``bin/django startproject <projectname>``.\n\n  See django's documentation for `startproject\n  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startproject>`_.\n\n  You can also look at `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/>`_.\n\n  This also means the ``projectegg`` option is now deprecated, it isn't needed\n  anymore.\n\n- We aim at django 1.7 and 1.8 now. Django 1.4 still works, (except that that\n  one doesn't have a good startproject command).\n\n- Gunicorn doesn't come with the django manage.py integration, so ``bin/django\n  run_gunicorn`` doesn't work anymore. If you add ``script-entrypoints =\n  gunicorn`` to the configuration, we generate a ``bin/django_env_gunicorn``\n  script that is identical to ``bin/gunicorn``, only with the environment\n  correctly set.  **Note: renamed in 2.1 to ``scripts-with-settings``**.\n\n  This way, you can use the wsgi.py script in your project (copy it from the\n  django docs if needed) with ``bin/django_env_gunicorn yourproject/wsgi.py``\n  just like suggested everywhere. This way you can adjust your wsgi file to\n  your liking and run it with gunicorn.\n\n  For other wsgi runners (or programs you want to use with the correct\n  environment set), you can add a full entry point to ``script-entrypoints``,\n  like ``script-entrypoints = gunicorn=gunicorn.app.wsgiapp:run`` would be the\n  full line for gunicorn. Look up the correct entrypoint in the relevant\n  package's ``setup.py``.\n\n  Django's 1.8 ``wsgi.py`` file looks like this, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/::\n\n      import os\n\n      from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application\n\n      os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"yourproject.settings\")\n\n      application = get_wsgi_application()\n\n\n- The ``wsgilog`` option has been deprecated, the old apache mod_wsgi script\n  hasn't been used for a long time.\n\n- Removed old pth option, previously used for pinax. Pinax uses proper python\n  packages since a long time, so it isn't needed anymore.\n\n\n\n1.11 (2014-11-21)\n-----------------\n\n- The ``dotted-settings-path`` options was only used in management script. Now\n  it is also used for the generated wsgi file and the test scripts.\n\n\n1.10 (2014-06-16)\n-----------------\n\n- Added ``dotted-settings-path`` option. Useful when you want to specify a\n  custom settings path to be used by the ``manage.main()`` command.\n\n- Renamed ``deploy_script_extra`` (with underscores) to\n  ``deploy-script-extra`` (with dashes) for consistency with the other\n  options. If the underscore version is found, an exception is raised.\n\n\n1.9 (2014-05-27)\n----------------\n\n- ``bin/test`` now passes along command line arguments to the underlying\n  management command. Previously, only the equivalent of ``manage.py test\n  list_of_apps`` would be done. Now command line arguments are passed as-is\n  after the list of apps.\n\n- Added ``deploy_script_extra`` option. It is appended to the wsgi script.\n  Useful for instance for a cloud hoster where you need to wrap your wsgi\n  application object in a custom call.\n\n\n1.8 (2014-05-27)\n----------------\n\n- Supporting buildout's relative-paths setting now.\n\n\n1.7 (2013-12-11)\n----------------\n\n- Add option to change the wsgi script name. Thanks hedleyroos (Fixes pull #74)\n\n1.6 (2013-10-28)\n----------------\n\n- Djangorecipe works with django 1.6 now.\n\n- Tested with Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. Pre-1.4 support is gone, now. Also\n  tested on Python 2.6/2.7, 3.2/3.3.\n\n- Moved to buildout 2 support only.\n\n- Removed generation of fastcgi script. You can run it easily as ``bin/django\n  runfcgi`` and it will be deprecated in Django 1.7 anyway.\n\n\n1.5 (2013-01-25)\n----------------\n\n- Removed support for a different python version than the one you use to run\n  buildout with. Previously, you could run your buildout with 2.6 but get\n  Django to use 2.7 instead. zc.buildout 2.0 doesn't allow it anymore, so we\n  removed it too.\n\n\n1.4 (2013-01-15)\n----------------\n\n- Added initialization code support. Thanks to anshumanb, jjmurre. (Closes #58).\n\n\n1.3 (2012-09-07)\n----------------\n\n- Removed deprecation warning in Django 1.4. Fixes #49, thanks Shagi.\n\n- Added documentation for use with mr.developer. Thanks shagi (closes issue #45)\n\n- Added Travis support.\n\n\n1.2.1 (2012-05-15)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed broken 1.2 release (missing ``*.rst`` files due to a recent txt-to-rst\n  rename action).\n\n\n1.2 (2012-05-14)\n----------------\n\n- Removed location path from recipe. Thanks bleskes (fixes issue #50).\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n\n- Added correct url to the deprecation warning\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n\n- Fixed Python3 Trove classifiers\n\n1.1\n---\n\n- Support python3.\n- Changed buildout and the tests to run the tests under nose.\n- Removed some old pre 0.99 unittests that dealt with download support.\n\n1.0\n---\n\n- Stable release with a real 1.0 version.\n- Made djangorecipe more pep08 compliant.\n\n0.99\n----\n\n- Djangorecipe now depends on Django. The use of the `version =` statement\n  is deprecated. Specify the django version in the\n  `[versions]` section. Install django via mr.developer if you need to use\n  an svn/git/hg repository. For other uses\n  Versionpin djangorecipe to 0.23.1 if you don't want to upgrade.\n  Thanks to Reinout van Rees for help with this release.\n\n- Removed subversion and download support.\n\n0.23.1\n------\n\n- Added a missing 'import os'\n\n0.23\n----\n\n- Support for settings/urls boilerplate for django 1.2 and django 1.3.\n  It defaults to 1.3 when the version isn't 1.2.\n\n0.22\n----\n\n- Added support for svn urls with spaces. Thanks to Brad103 (fixes #537718).\n\n- Updated code and buildout to use newest zc.recipe.egg,\n  zc.recipe.testrunner and python-dateutil.\n\n0.21\n----\n\n- The admin url is now configured for django 1.1 or higher. Thanks to\n  Sam Charrington (fixes #672220).\n\n- Bootstrap.py updated (fixes #501954).\n\n0.20\n----\n\n- The recipe know makes the `django` package know to setuptools during install.\n  This closes #397864. Thanks to Daniel Bruce and Dan Fairs for the patch.\n\n- Fixed #451065 which fixes a problem with the WSGI log file option.\n\n- Added the posibilty to configure more FCGI related settings. Thanks to Vasily\n  Sulatskov for the patch.\n\n0.19.2\n------\n\n- The generated WSGI & FCGI scripts are now properly removed when\n  options change (fixes #328182). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the\n  patch.\n\n- Scripts are now updated when dependencies change. This fixes #44658,\n  thanks to Paul Carduner for the patch.\n\n0.19.1\n------\n\n- Applied fix for the change in WSGI script generation. The previous\n  release did not work properly.\n\n0.19\n----\n\n- When running again with non-newest set the recipe will no longer\n  update the Subversion checkout. Thanks to vinilios for the patch.\n\n- The WSGI and FCGI scripts are now generated using Buildout's own\n  system. This makes them more similar to the generated manage script\n  with regard to the setup of paths. Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the\n  patch.\n\n0.18\n----\n\n- Paths from eggs and extra-paths now get precedence over the default\n  system path (fixes #370420). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the patch.\n\n- The generated WSGI script now uses the `python` option if\n  present. This fixes #361695.\n\n0.17.4\n------\n\n- Fixed a problem when not running in verbose mode (fixes #375151).\n\n0.17.3\n------\n\n- Removed dependency on setuptools_bzr since it does not seem to work\n  like I expected.\n\n0.17.2\n------\n\n- Changed the download code to use urllib2. This should make it work\n  from behind proxies (fixes #362822). Thanks to pauld for the patch.\n\n0.17.1\n------\n\n- Fixed a problem with the new WSGI logging option #348797. Thanks to\n  Bertrand Mathieu for the patch.\n\n- Disable generation of the WSGI log if \"wsgilog\" isn't set, thanks to\n  Jacob Kaplan-Moss for the patch.\n\n- Updated buildout.cfg and .bzrignore, thanks Jacob Kaplan-Moss.\n\n0.17\n----\n\n- Added an option to specify a log file for output redirection from\n  the WSGI script. Thanks to Guido Wesdorp for the patch.\n\n0.16\n----\n\n- Subversion aliases are now supported (something like\n  svn+mystuff://myjunk). Thanks to Remco for the patch.\n\n0.15.2\n------\n\n- Update to move pth-files finder from the __init__ method to the\n  install method so it runs in buildout-order, else it looks for pth\n  files in dirs that may not yet exist. Thanks to Chris Shenton for\n  the update to his original patch.\n\n0.15.1\n------\n\n- Update to make the previously added pth-files option better\n  documented.\n\n0.15\n----\n\n- Added \"pth-files\" option to add libraries to extra-paths from\n  site .pth files. Thanks to Chris Shenton for the patch.\n\n0.14\n----\n\n- The recipe now supports creating a FCGI script. Thanks to Jannis\n  Leidel for the patch.\n\n- When downloading a Django recipe for the first time the recipe now\n  properly reports the url it is downloading from.\n\n0.13\n----\n\n- Specifying a user name within a subversion url now works. The code\n  that determined the revision has been updated. This fixes issue\n  #274004. Thanks to Remco for the patch.\n\n- Updated the template for creating new projects. It now uses the\n  current admin system when generating it's `urls.py` file. This fixes\n  issue #276255. Thanks to Roland for the patch.\n\n0.12.1\n------\n\n- Re-upload since CHANGES.txt was missing from the release\n\n0.12\n----\n\n- The recipe no longer executes subversion to determine whether the\n  versions is to be downloaded using subversion. This fixes issue\n  #271145. Thanks to Kapil Thangavelu for the patch.\n\n- Changed the `pythonpath` option to `extra-paths`. This makes the\n  recipe more consistent with other recipes (see issue #270908).\n\n0.11\n----\n\n- Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure\n  the update method is always called. It would not be called in the\n  previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it\n  wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout\n  saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to\n  un-install & install.\n\n- When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi\n  file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been\n  fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.\n\n- The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced\n  and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe\n  more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch\n  from issue #260628.\n\n0.10\n----\n\n- The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a\n  release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes\n  issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and\n  suggesting a solution.\n\n- Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running\n  the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for\n  reporting this.\n\n- Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This\n  disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks\n  to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n\n- Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing\n  manifest file\n\n0.9\n---\n\n- The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth\n  settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).\n\n- The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use\n  this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the\n  standard svn @ syntax\n\n- The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by\n  the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.",
