    "description": "=================================\nWorldpay package for django-oscar\n=================================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay.png\n    :alt: Continuous integration status\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/#!/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay?branch=master\n\nThis package provides integration between django-oscar_ and Worldpay Select Junior (also known as HTML Redirect).\n\n.. _django-oscar: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar\n\nThese payment options can be used individually or together.  Further, the\npackage is structured so that it can be used without Oscar if you so wish.\n\n.. _`Continuous integration status`: http://travis-ci.org/#!/matthewwilkes/django-oscar-worldpay?branch=master\n\nCurrent status\n--------------\n\nWe believe this product is usable in production, but as always, it is released as-is without warranty. If you find any bugs please submit either a\nbug report or a pull request.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nThis package supports the so-called 'MD5 Encryption' security of Worldpay, with configurable fields. It also implement the DNS based checking of\nresponse callbacks.\n\nIt uses C_Parameters internally for passing cart information back, this uses a SHA-based HMAC for verification.\n\nThis package doesn't yet support the `callbackPW` parameter, patches to add this would be very welcome.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThe following parameters should be set:\n\n    * WORLDPAY_INSTANCE_ID\n        A string containing your instance ID, such as '12345'\n        \n    * WORLDPAY_TEST_MODE\n        A boolean to determine test mode\n\n    * WORLDPAY_MD5_SECRET\n        The string entered in the MD5 field of WorldPay's console, or None\n        \n    * WORLDPAY_SIGNATURE_FIELDS\n        A tuple of field names, such as ('instId', 'cartId', 'amount', 'currency'), to use with the MD5 Secret\n\n    * WORLDPAY_REMOTE_ADDRESS_HEADER\n        A string pointing to the key in Request.META that contains the IP of the request's origin.\n        Usually either `REMOTE_ADDR` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.\n\nGotchas\n-------\n\nWorldpay's recommended authentication of requests is based on multiple DNS lookups. Please be sure you have a working and reliable DNS setup\nbefore using this package. Patches to make this lookup optional and to add the `CallbackPW` alternative would be welcome.\n\nYou also need the dynamic callback response parameter to be enabled. Currently there are two callbacks, a fail and a success callback. If these\ntwo were integrated this requirement could be dropped.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe package is released under the `New BSD license`_.\n\n.. _`New BSD license`: https://github.com/matthewwilkes/django-oscar-worldpay/blob/master/LICENSE\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease let `@matthewwilkes`_ know if you use this package, feedback would be very useful. Pull requests are very much welcome, please don't\nhesitate to send them. If they're not attended to quickly, ping `@matthewwilkes` on twitter or GitHub. \n\nSupport\n-------\n\nHaving problems or got a question?\n\n* Have a look at the sandbox site as this is a sample Oscar project\n  integrated with Worldpay.  See the contributing guide within the\n  docs for instructions on how to set up the sandbox locally.\n\n* Ping `@matthewwilkes`_ (or `@django_oscar`_) with quick queries.\n\n* Ask more detailed questions on the Oscar mailing list: `django-oscar@googlegroups.com`_\n\n* Use Github_ for submitting issues and pull requests.\n\n.. _`@django_oscar`: https://twitter.com/django_oscar\n.. _`@matthewwilkes`: https://twitter.com/matthewwilkes\n.. _`django-oscar@googlegroups.com`: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/django-oscar\n.. _`Github`: http://github.com/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n1.2 (2015-10-22)\n----------------\n\n* Make order confirmation more reliable, by fixing a failure mode if the user sends multiple finalisation requests\n  [bharling]\n\n* On payment failure redirect to basket:summary rather than basket:preview, to support multiple gateways.\n  [lpakula]\n\n* Load OrderPlacementMixin dynamically to allow overrides\n  [bharling]\n\n1.1 (2015-09-28)\n----------------\n\n* Fix a bug when phonenumber wasn't set.\n* Remove some old PayPal references that were missed.\n\n1.0 (2015-09-28)\n----------------\n\n* Initial release.
