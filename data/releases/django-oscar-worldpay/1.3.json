    "description": "=================================\r\nWorldpay package for django-oscar\r\n=================================\r\n\r\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay.png\r\n    :alt: Continuous integration status\r\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/#!/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay\r\n\r\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\r\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay?branch=master\r\n\r\nThis package provides integration between django-oscar_ and Worldpay Select Junior (also known as HTML Redirect).\r\n\r\n.. _django-oscar: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar\r\n\r\nThese payment options can be used individually or together.  Further, the\r\npackage is structured so that it can be used without Oscar if you so wish.\r\n\r\n.. _`Continuous integration status`: http://travis-ci.org/#!/matthewwilkes/django-oscar-worldpay?branch=master\r\n\r\nCurrent status\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe believe this product is usable in production, but as always, it is released as-is without warranty. If you find any bugs please submit either a\r\nbug report or a pull request.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis package supports the so-called 'MD5 Encryption' security of Worldpay, with configurable fields. It also implement the DNS based checking of\r\nresponse callbacks.\r\n\r\nIt uses C_Parameters internally for passing cart information back, this uses a SHA-based HMAC for verification.\r\n\r\nThis package doesn't yet support the `callbackPW` parameter, patches to add this would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe following parameters should be set:\r\n\r\n    * WORLDPAY_INSTANCE_ID\r\n        A string containing your instance ID, such as '12345'\r\n        \r\n    * WORLDPAY_TEST_MODE\r\n        A boolean to determine test mode\r\n\r\n    * WORLDPAY_MD5_SECRET\r\n        The string entered in the MD5 field of WorldPay's console, or None\r\n        \r\n    * WORLDPAY_SIGNATURE_FIELDS\r\n        A tuple of field names, such as ('instId', 'cartId', 'amount', 'currency'), to use with the MD5 Secret\r\n\r\n    * WORLDPAY_REMOTE_ADDRESS_HEADER\r\n        A string pointing to the key in Request.META that contains the IP of the request's origin.\r\n        Usually either `REMOTE_ADDR` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.\r\n\r\nGotchas\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWorldpay's recommended authentication of requests is based on multiple DNS lookups. Please be sure you have a working and reliable DNS setup\r\nbefore using this package. Patches to make this lookup optional and to add the `CallbackPW` alternative would be welcome.\r\n\r\nYou also need the dynamic callback response parameter to be enabled. Currently there are two callbacks, a fail and a success callback. If these\r\ntwo were integrated this requirement could be dropped.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe package is released under the `New BSD license`_.\r\n\r\n.. _`New BSD license`: https://github.com/matthewwilkes/django-oscar-worldpay/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease let `@matthewwilkes`_ know if you use this package, feedback would be very useful. Pull requests are very much welcome, please don't\r\nhesitate to send them. If they're not attended to quickly, ping `@matthewwilkes` on twitter or GitHub. \r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHaving problems or got a question?\r\n\r\n* Have a look at the sandbox site as this is a sample Oscar project\r\n  integrated with Worldpay.  See the contributing guide within the\r\n  docs for instructions on how to set up the sandbox locally.\r\n\r\n* Ping `@matthewwilkes`_ (or `@django_oscar`_) with quick queries.\r\n\r\n* Ask more detailed questions on the Oscar mailing list: `django-oscar@googlegroups.com`_\r\n\r\n* Use Github_ for submitting issues and pull requests.\r\n\r\n.. _`@django_oscar`: https://twitter.com/django_oscar\r\n.. _`@matthewwilkes`: https://twitter.com/matthewwilkes\r\n.. _`django-oscar@googlegroups.com`: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/django-oscar\r\n.. _`Github`: http://github.com/MatthewWilkes/django-oscar-worldpay\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\n1.3 (2016-03-09)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Fix a bug where the reliability fix included in 1.2 would not work if the two requests were almost simultanous.\r\n  [bharling, mwilkes]\r\n\r\n1.2 (2015-10-22)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Make order confirmation more reliable, by fixing a failure mode if the user sends multiple finalisation requests\r\n  [bharling]\r\n\r\n* On payment failure redirect to basket:summary rather than basket:preview, to support multiple gateways.\r\n  [lpakula]\r\n\r\n* Load OrderPlacementMixin dynamically to allow overrides\r\n  [bharling]\r\n\r\n1.1 (2015-09-28)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Fix a bug when phonenumber wasn't set.\r\n  [mwilkes]\r\n* Remove some old PayPal references that were missed.\r\n  [mwilkes]\r\n\r\n1.0 (2015-09-28)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Initial release. Working integration of Worldpay and Oscar.\r\n  [mwilkes]\r\n\r\n0.1\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n* Skeleton of Worldpay integration, supporting making requests and receiving callbacks.\r\n  [mwilkes]\r\n\r\n0.0\r\n~~~\r\n* Forked from django-oscar-paypal 0.9.5",
