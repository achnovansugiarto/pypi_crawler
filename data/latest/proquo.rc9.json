    "description": "# Readme\nProQuo is a tool for the detection of short quotations (<= 4 words) between two texts, a source text and a target text.\nThe target text is the text quoting the source text. Quotations in the target text need to be clearly marked with\nquotations marks. As a default, `\"` is used as the opening and closing quotation mark. This can be changed, see below.\n\n## Overview\nThe main purpose of this tool is to use the pretrained models for the detection of short quotations.\nThe library also supports training and testing of custom models for reference classification, relation classification\nand linking classification.\n\n## Installation\nCheckout this repository and then run:\n\n~~~\npython -m pip install .\n~~~\n\nThis installs `ProQuo` and all dependencies except `tensorflow` which needs to be installed manually depending on\nthe individual needs, see [Tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).\n\nFor `RelationModelLstmTrainer`, `tensorflow-text` is needed. `RelationModelLstmTrainer` should normally not be needed as\n`RelationModelBertTrainer` performs better and is the default in the pipeline.\n\n## Usage\nThere are two ways to use the tool: in code and from the command line. Both are described in the following sections.\n\n### Quotation detection\nThere are two approaches to quotation detection: A specialized pipeline and a general language model based approach.\nTo run the specialized pipeline, use the following command:\n\n#### Specialized pipeline\n~~~\nproquo compare\npath_to_source_text\npath_to_target_text\npath_to_the_reference_vocab_file\npath_to_the_reference_model_file\npath_to_the_relation_tokenizer_folder\npath_to_the_relation_model_folder\n--text\n--output-type text\n~~~\n\n#### Language model approach\n\nTo run general language model based approach, use the following command:\n\n~~~\nproquolm compare\npath_to_source_text\npath_to_target_text\npath_to_the_tokenizer_folder\npath_to_the_model_folder\n--text\n--output-type text\n~~~\n\n`--output-type text` prints the results to the command line. To save the results to a file, use `--output-type csv` or\n`--output-type json`. `--text` includes the quotation text in the output.\nThe default opening and closing quotation mark is `\"`. Use `--open-quote` and `--close-quote` to define which opening\nand closing quotation marks to use.\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n~~~\n10\t15\t500\t505\tquote\tquote\n1000\t1016\t20\t36\tsome other quote\tsome other quote\n~~~\nThe first two numbers are the character start and end positions in the source text and the other two numbers are the\ncharacter start and end positions in the target text.\n\n#### Note\nThere are a number of command line arguments to configure the output format, for example, to save the result to a csv\nfile. For all options, use the following commands:\n\n~~~\nproquo compare -h\n~~~\n\n~~~\nproquolm compare -h\n~~~\n\n### Pretrained models\nThe pretrained models can be downloaded from *anonymized for review*\n\n### Training and testing a model\n\n#### Reference model\nThe following command can be used to train a reference model:\n\n~~~\nproquo train reference\npath_to_train_set.txt\npath_to_val_set.txt\npath_to_the_output_folder\n~~~\n\n`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of two strings and a class,\ntab separated, for example:\n\n~~~\nS. 47   S. 35\t1\n63\tDKV III, 17\t0\n~~~\n\nTo test the model, run:\n\n~~~\nproquo test reference\npath_to_test_set.txt\npath_to_the_reference_vocab_file\npath_to_the_reference_model_file\n~~~\n\n#### Relation model\nThe following command can be used to train a bert relation model:\n\n~~~\nproquo train relation\npath_to_train_set.txt\npath_to_val_set.txt\npath_to_the_output_folder\n--arch\n\"bert\"\n~~~\n\n`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of a string and a class,\ntab separated, for example:\n\n~~~\nsome context, some text <Q> some quote </Q>  ( <OREF> ). some more text ( <REF> )   0\n~~~\n\nTo test the model, run:\n\n~~~\nproquo test relation bert\npath_to_test_set.txt\npath_to_the_tokenizer_folder\npath_to_the_model_folder\n~~~\n\n#### Linking model\nThe following command can be used to train a linking model:\n\n~~~\nproquolm train\npath_to_train_set.txt\npath_to_val_set.txt\npath_to_the_output_folder\n~~~\n\n`path_to_train_set.txt` and `path_to_val_set.txt` contain one example per line in the form of two strings and a class,\ntab separated, for example:\n\n~~~\nsome text for context, <S> candidate </S> some more text  start of second text, some context <T> candidate </T> text text text  0\n~~~\n\nTo test the model, run:\n\n~~~\nproquolm test\npath_to_test_set.txt\npath_to_the_tokenizer_folder\npath_to_the_model_folder\n~~~\n",
