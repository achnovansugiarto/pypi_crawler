    "description": "# django-orghierarchy\n\nReusable Django application for hierarchical organizations\n\n# Installation\n\n1. `pip install django-orghierarchy`\n\n2. Add `django_orghierarchy` to `INSTALLED_APPS`\n\n3. If you wish to use your own Django model as data source model (the same way you hot-swap your own user model in Django), add `DJANGO_ORGHIERARCHY_DATASOURCE_MODEL = 'yourapp.DataSource'` to your project settings. Otherwise, the barebones Django model `DataSource` at django_orghierarchy/models.py is used, it contains the fields a data source model *must* contain to be used with django-orghierarchy. Similarly, django-orghierarchy links to your user model, so `AUTH_USER_MODEL` must be defined in Django project settings as always.\n\n4. Run migrations\n\n    ```python\n    python manage.py migrate django_orghierarchy\n    ```\n\n# Usage\n\nThe `Organization` class is the main feature of django-orghierarchy. We use [`django-mptt`](https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/) to implement an organization hierarchy that can be as deep as you wish. Each organization has a name, a data source (referring to the system the organization data is from), origin_id (referring to organization id in the original data source), founding date and dissolution date, status (*normal* or *affiliated*), a place in a forest of organization trees, and possibly a *replacement organization*, which means a link to any other organization across the trees (making the forest strictly a directed graph, not a bunch of trees). Replacement organization allows linking dissolved organization structures to new ones so that old user rights are automatically transferred across the hierarchy to the replacing organization.\n\nEach organization may have `admin_users` and `regular_users`, which are linked to your Django user model. Also, an organization may have `sub_organizations` and `affiliated_organizations`. You may have any number of top level organizations. Also, some extra user permissions are defined, i.e. `add_affiliated_organization`, `change_affiliated_organization`, `delete_affiliated_organization`, `replace_organization` and `change_organization_regular_users`. These permissions are for adding *regular users* and *affiliated organizations* in Django-admin, and creating *replacement* links, without being allowed to touch the *admin users* or the existing organization hierarchy. *Affiliated* organizations usually have more limited rights than *normal* organizations within the hierarchy; they are meant for external organizations you collaborate with and wish to grant limited rights to.\n\nYour desired user rights and permissions for each user group in each level of the organization depend on your application details, so you should implement your own user rights checks depending on your needs. You may e.g. create a user model permissions mixin that uses information on the user organization, as done in [Linkedevents permissions](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/blob/master/events/permissions.py) and [Linkedevents user model](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/blob/master/helevents/models.py). The user rights model is originally specified [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/issues/235).\n\nYou may import an existing organization hierarchy from a REST API corresponding to the [6Aika Paatos decisionmaking API specification](https://github.com/6aika/api-paatos), based on the [Popolo project](http://www.popoloproject.com/), with the included importer, for example:\n\n    python manage.py import_organizations \"https://api.hel.fi/paatos/v1/organization/\"\n    \nYou may give the organization data source a specific id to correspond to your own data source model ids in your project:\n\n    python manage.py import_organizations \"https://api.hel.fi/paatos/v1/organization/\" -s original_id:imported_id\n\nOtherwise, the data source id in the original API is used for the imported organizations (`helsinki` in the Helsinki API).\n\n# Development\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit tests\n\nRun tests\n\n    py.test\n\nRun tests with coverage report\n\n    py.test --cov-report html --cov .\n    \nOpen htmlcov/index.html for the coverage report.\n\n### Integration tests\n\nWe need to provide different settings files for the test as the\nsetting variables for swappable model are only evaluated the first\ntime the module is imported.\n\nRun tests\n\n    python manage.py test --tag=custom_ds --settings=tests.test_app.settings_custom_ds\n    python manage.py test --tag=custom_pk_ds --settings=tests.test_app.settings_custom_pk_ds",
