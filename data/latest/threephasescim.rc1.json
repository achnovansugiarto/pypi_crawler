    "description": "# Three Phase Squirrel Cage Induction Motor Design\n\n## What does this Python package do?\nThis interactive package has a collection of modules, that performs individual design steps for a Squirrel Cage Induction Motor. \nThe user has to input the full-load (nameplate) ratings and this package will generate the design sheet, considering the design constraints at hand. \n\n## Prerequisites\n1. Python 3 (3.6+ preferred). Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  \n2. Should be able to view/read Excel(.xlsx) files.\n\n## Installation\nOpen terminal or command prompt, and run `pip install threephasescim` or `pip3 install threephasescim` depending on your OS.\nThis will download and install the latest release, along with the required libraries. \n\n## Before you run it\nShould have the following full-load ratings. Take care of the units. \n- Power Rating (kW). Eg.: 5\n- Power Factor (lagging). Eg.: 0.85\n- Efficiency (per unit). Eg.: 0.9\n- Speed (rpm). Eg.: 1500\n- Line Voltage (V). Eg.: 110\n\n## Expected Output\n- 1. Average field flux (Wb/m<sup>2</sup>)\n  2. Ampere conductor (ac)\n  3. Expected efficiency (%)\n  4. Obtained efficiency (%)\n  5. Temperature rise (&deg;C)\n  6. Current criterion satisfied? (yes/no)\n- Design sheet containing all the design parameters of the machine to be designed (if a solution is present). \n- Else, it will show `Design sheet failed...`. In this case, it is advised to dive into the basics of machine design and tune the ratings accordingly. Then, retry. \n\n## How to get your design sheet?\n### Running the package as a scipt\n1. Open terminal or command prompt.\n2. Naviagte to the directory/path where you want the design sheet to be saved.\n3. Type `python -m threephasescim` or `python3 -m threephasescim` and run, depending on your OS.\n4. Enter all the required ratings, as asked.\n5. If the design sheet is successfully prepared, then, find it in the current working directory/path. \n### Running as an import\nOpen `ipython` or `ipython3` or Python shell.\n\n`>>> import threephasescim.master as thd` <br />\nWhen running the above line for first time, you will be asked to enter all the required ratings.\n\nTo show the saved ratings, <br />\n`>>> thd.show_rating()`\n\nTo enter a new set of ratings, <br />\n`>>> thd.set_rating()`\n\nTo get your design sheet, <br />\n`>>> thd.design_your_machine()`\n\nIf the design sheet is successfully prepared, then, find it in the current working directory/path.\n\n## What to do now?\n- For more detailed analysis or insights, click [here](https://github.com/pranabendra/three-phase-scim/tree/master/threephasescim/threephasescim).\n- If facing any design issues, open an issue.\n- For any suggestions, open an issue.\n\n## Reference\nA Course in Electrical Machine Design  \nA.K.Sawhney, A.Chakrabarti  \nDhanpat Rai & Co. 2006  \n\n## Acknowledgement\nSincere thanks to Prof. Susanta Ray, Electrical Engineering Department, Jadavpur University for allowing the design of induction machines programmatically.",
