Missing attendance days are generated on the fly\nin the report with their corresponding theoretical hours.\n\nThere is the possibility of counting as theoretical time some leave types if\nspecified in them.\n\nAs an example, imagine a work week with 40 theoretical hours, and these\nattendance situation:\n\n* Monday: Worked 10 hours\n* Tuesday: Worked 10 hours\n* Wednesday: Worked 10 hours\n* Thursday: Worked 10 hours\n* Friday: Ask for a compensation leave (said leave type), as already worked\n  40 hours.\n\nOn the report, whole week should put 40 theoretical hours - 8 per day - against\n40 worked hours (although they were on previous days, and none on Friday).\n\nOn contrary, if you want to take a holiday one of that days, you should ask for\na leave type without the check for counting as theoretical time, and then the\nwhole week will be 32 theoretical hours against the worked hours of that week\nwithout the leave.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nOn installation time, this module computes the theoretical hours for the day of\nthe attendance check-in, so if you have a lot of records, this would be a bit\nslow.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nYou need to be at least \"Attendance / Manual Attendance\" for being able to see\nthe attendances report.\n\nFor including some leave types in the theoretical time, you have to:\n\n#. Go to *Leaves > Configuration > Leave Types*.\n#. Select leave type you want to include.\n#. Check the mark \"Include in theoretical hours\".\n\nWhen generating non worked days, this module uses a start date for beginning\nthe series generation, which is:\n\n* Manual start date set on the employee.\n* If not set, the greatest of these 2 dates:\n\n  * Employee creation date.\n  * Working calendar line start date.\n\nFor configuring manual start date, you have to:\n\n#. Go to *Employees > Employees*.\n#. Select an employee.\n#. Go to \"HR Settings\" page.\n#. Set the date in \"Theoretical hours start date\" field.\n\nThe generation will stop on the end date of the working calendar line or today,\nso don't forget to properly set start and end dates of the lines of the working\ncalendar for not leaving empty spaces between them.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n#. Go to *Attendances > Reporting > Theoretical vs Attended Time Analysis*.\n#. Check pivot table or look at the graph view.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Employees with less than 1 week in the company will show full week\n  theoretical hours.\n* Activate ORM cache for improving performance on computing theoretical hours,\n  but assuring that the cache is cleared when the conditions of the computation\n  changes.\n* If you change employee's working time, theoretical hours for non attended\n  days will be computed according this new calendar. You have to define\n  start and end dates inside the calendar for avoiding this side effect.\n* Theoretical hours of affected days when changing the leave type to be\n  included or not in theoretical time are not recomputed.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues/new?body=module:%20hr_attendance_report_theoretical_time%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`__:\n\n  * Pedro M.
