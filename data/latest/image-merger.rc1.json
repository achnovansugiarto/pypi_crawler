Default `False`\n- `merge_strategy: int`: Optional int to set the merging strategy. Either `MERGE_HORIZONTALLY`, - `MERGE_VERTICALLY` or `MERGE_GRID`(default)\n- `preserve_aspect_ratio: bool`: Optional boolean that defines if proportion of each image should be kept or if image can be squeezed/extended to fit. Default `False`\n\t- Setting it to `True` can lead to images being distored to fit layout but there will be no gaps.\n\t- Setting it to `False` will kept each image aspect ratio but can lead to black gaps in output image.\n\n## Configuration examples\n- `ImageToMerge.path` can either be a path(local or relative) or HTTP(S) URL\n- `limit_horizontal` and `limit_vertical` are optional and can also be used at the same time\n- If `limit_horizontal` and `limit_vertical` are not set, and `merge_strategy` is set to `MERGE_GRID` The process will try to fit as best as possible all images in a square grid.\n- List of images can be shuffled randomly using `shuffle=True` parameter\n\n\n## More examples\n```\nfrom ImageMerger import Merger, ImageToMerge\n\n# Initialize list of images\nlist_images = [\n\tImageToMerge(path='images/samples/1.png'),\n\tImageToMerge(path='images/samples/2.png'),\n\tImageToMerge(path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/samples/3.png'),\n\tImageToMerge(path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/samples/4.png'),\n\tImageToMerge(path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/samples/5.png')\n]\n\n# Load merger with different settings\nm = Merger(\n    list_images=list_images,\n    preserve_aspect_ratio=True,\n    limit_vertical=2\n  )\n\n# Save merged image\nm.save_image(filename=\"images/results/output_5_grid_keep_aspect_ratio.png\")\n```\n![output_5_grid_keep_aspect_ratio.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/results/output_5_grid_keep_aspect_ratio.png)\n\n```\nfrom ImageMerger import Merger, ImageToMerge\n\n# Initialize list of images\nlist_images = [ImageToMerge(path=f\"images/samples/{i}.png\") for i in range(1, 11)]\n\n# Load merger with different settings\nm = Merger(\n    list_images=list_images,\n    limit_horizontal=2\n)\n\n# Save merged image\nm.save_image(filename=\"images/results/output_10_2rows.png\")\n```\n![output_10_2rows.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/results/output_10_2rows.png)\n\n```\nfrom ImageMerger import Merger, ImageToMerge\n\n# Initialize list of images\nlist_images = [ImageToMerge(path=f\"images/samples/{i}.png\") for i in range(1, 11)]\n\n# Load merger with different settings\nm = Merger(\n    list_images=list_images,\n    shuffle=True\n)\n\n# Save merged image\nm.save_image(filename=\"images/results/output_10_grid_shuffled.png\")\n```\n![output_10_grid_shuffled.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/image-merger/main/images/results/output_10_grid_shuffled.png)\n\n# References\n- [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/)\n",
