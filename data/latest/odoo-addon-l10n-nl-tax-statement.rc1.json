This option makes the *invoice date* leading for\nthe tax declaration of a period, rather than the accounting date, and\nallows you to change the accounting date of incoming invoices to the period\nto which the costs apply and still create a legally valid Dutch tax\ndeclaration. Without this option, the entries on the tax statement are\ncollected using only their accounting dates (what Odoo calls *standard\ntaxes*).\n\nThis setting is not compatible with the Odoo *Cash basis* (Kasstelsel) setting\nwhich leads to the creation of tax journal lines at the moment that a payment\nis received, so when using *Cash basis* you need to disable the *Invoice\nbasis* setting to create a valid Dutch tax declaration using this module.\nTo disable the *Invoice basis* for a company, you need to:\n\n#. Open your Company form and verify that Country is set to ``Netherlands``.\n#. Go to ``Invoicing -> Configuration -> Settings``, enable/disable ``NL Tax Invoice Basis (Factuurstelsel)`` and ``Apply``.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo create a statement you need to:\n\n#. Verify that you have enough permits. You need to belong to the *Show Full Accounting Features* group.\n#. Go to the menu: `Invoicing -> Reporting > NL BTW Statement`\n#. Create a statement, providing a name and specifying start date and end date\n#. Press the Update button to calculate the report: the report lines will be displayed in the tab `Statement`\n#. Manually enter the BTW amounts of lines '5d', '5e', '5f' (in Edit mode, click on the amount of the line to be able to change it)\n#. Press the Post button to set the status of the statement to Posted; the statements set to this state cannot be modified\n\nTo add past undeclared invoices/moves:\n\n#. Open the tab `Past Undeclared Moves`, available when the statement is in status Draft.\n#. Set an initial date (field From Date) from which the past undeclared moves will be displayed.\n#. One by one, add the displayed undeclared moves, by clicking on the `Add Move` button present in each line.\n#. Press the Update button in order to recompute the statement lines.\n\nExtra info about the workflow:\n\n#. If you need to recalculate or modify or delete a statement already set to Posted status you need first to set it back to Draft status: press the button Reset to Draft\n#. Instead, if you send the statement to the Tax Authority, you may want to avoid that the statement is set back to Draft: to avoid this, press the button Final. If you then confirm, it will be not possible to modify this Statement or reset it back to draft anymore.\n\nPrinting a PDF report:\n\n#. If you need to print the report in PDF, open a statement form and click: `Print -> NL Tax Statement`\n\nMulticompany fiscal unit:\n\n#. According the Dutch Tax Authority, for all the companies belonging to a\n   fiscal unit, it's possible to declare one single tax statement.\n#. To create one tax statement for a fiscal unit, log in into the parent\n   company and select the child companies in the statement (be sure the user\n   belongs to the multicompany group).\n#. The child companies must have the same Tax codes labels (Tax Tags) as the\n   parent company, the same currency as the parent company and must be located\n   in The Netherlands.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Exporting in SBR/XBLR format not yet available\n* Limit invoices to last 5 year based on fiscal year end date (legal requirement)\n* The unreported from date is calculate as 1 quarter, it should take 1 fiscal year based on fiscal year end date\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands/issues/new?body=module:%20l10n_nl_tax_statement%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Onestein\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Andrea Stirpe <a.stirpe@onestein.nl>\n* Antonio Esposito <a.esposito@onestein.nl>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/l10n-netherlands <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands/tree/15.0/l10n_nl_tax_statement>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
