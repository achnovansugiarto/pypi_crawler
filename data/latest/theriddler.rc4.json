    "description": "The Riddler\n===========\n\nThe Riddler is a project for learning purposes. \n\nIt is a sample project made for\nthe upcoming lecture *Einfuehrung in Python* of the university *HTWG\nKonstanz* at Constance, Germany.\n\nIt consists of riddles the solution of which preferably require learning Python\nbasics.\nThe riddles are intended to be solved programmatically, and most of them can\nbe solved by straightforward and short scripts.\nThe solution sometimes will require the use of extra modules, which can\nall be downloaded from the internet.\n\nThe Riddler is designated to accompany the lecture and make the\nstudents apply and consolidate their theoretical knowledge without\ngreater guidance and by play.\nAfter mastering the first few riddles, the application leads to the\nproject itself and its distribution here on PyPI, and is then intended\nto encourage the students to revise and modify, and finally republish it\nfor the following ones.\n\nWith this approach, the project is expected to result in the making of a sophisticated \nlearning project, geared to the needs of the learners, and well tried and tested. \n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nAt the beginning, the project is handed out to the students in the form\nof an installer package (\".msi\" file), for \"mysterious\" intentions.\n\nOnce they have solved the first riddles and end up here,\nThe Riddler shall be downloaded over its PyPI-Homepage and the downloaded File\nhas to be extracted. Subsequently it can be run by moving to the\nextracted folder and typing ``python theriddler`` in the shell.\n\nInstalling with Pip\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIt is also possible to install this project with pip from the shell by\ntyping ``pip install theRiddler``, but it is not meant to be installed\nthis way for testing and development purposes.\n\nAnyway, it could be started then by going into the directory where pip\ninstalled it in, and by directly running the \"__main__.py\" script from\nthere.\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-\tThe \"setup.py\" script is yet built with `Setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/>`_.\n\n-\tThe `Pillow <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/5.0.0/>`_ or \"PIL\" (Python Imaging Library) \n\tmodule is used to display pictures, as the \"PhotoImage\" class from the built-in\n\t\"Tkinter\" module provides comparably lean functionalities.\n\t\n-\tTo run tests, `Nose <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/1.3.7/>`_ is required.\n\n-\tThe  installer package handed out at the beginning is made with \n\t`cx_Freeze <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze/6.0b1>`_.\n\tTherefore, another \"setup.py\" script is used. \n\tMore information is provided in the attachment folder \"misc\" within the package.\n\n- \tSome riddles require a valid connection to the internet. \n\tThe connection is accomplished with `certifi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi/2018.1.18>`_, \n\t`beautifulsoup4 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.6.0>`_ and \n\t`urllib3 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3/1.22>`_.\n\t\n\nContributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPlease read the **CONTRIBUTING** file from the \"misc\" folder for\ndetails.\n\nVersioning\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe versioning is intended to be made after \"Semver\". \nCheck https://semver.org/.\n\nThe initial release was \"theRiddler 0.1.0\", 21th February 2018.\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nThe entire content of this project is \"self-made\", pictures included.\n\nThe icon was created with a freeware version of the application \"IcoFX\" (v1.64).\n\n\nThe author waives any copyright for the content.\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the **LICENSE**\nfile for details.\n\nAuthor\n~~~~~~\n\nEtienne Martin,\n\nstudent of the *HTWG Konstanz*, at the department of electrical\nengineering.\n\nThis project is part of the bachelor thesis created to achieve the\nbachelor of science degree.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-\tThe conception of this project was inspired by\n\thttp://www.pythonchallenge.com/. Some riddles resemble an adaptation of the ones found \n\tin the python challenge.\n\n\tThanks to *Nadav Samet*, you can go visit his `blog <http://www.thesamet.com/>`_.\n\t\"Because everyone needs a blog\".\n\n-\tThe \"Gothon Trash Game\" is an adaption and inspired by \"Gothons from\n\tPlanet Percal#25\" from Zed Shaw's book \"Learn Python the Hard Way\",\n\texercise 43.",
