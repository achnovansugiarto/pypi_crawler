These differences likely originate from differences in algorithms for preprocessing data, matching MSn spectra to peptides, quantifying peak areas, matching assignments between samples as well as differences in the myriad parameters that must be set by the user to initiate an analysis. Thorough analysis of these variables is, however, complicated since the ‘true’ sample composition of real data files is almost never completely known.\n\nSynthedia creates synthetic LC-MS/MS data that mimics real data but with a composition that is exactly known. Currently, synthedia support the creation of Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) style data wherein fixed, large m/z windows are sequentially isolated for fragmentation. We have focused on creating DIA data to date since the complexity of the analysis preformed by processing tools is substantial and the impact of different acquisition methodologies on the eventual outcome is somewhat more difficult to predict.\n\nSynthedia can be configured to produce synthetic DIA data that mimics a wide range of acquisition strategies. For example, data can be simulated that models the same set of peptides eluted over progressively shorter gradients which would allow an assessment of how processing software copes with increasing complexity of data. Data can be modelled with different mass spectral resolutions, chromatographic peak tailing, DIA window strategies among others. Synthedia can also help to assess quantitation by creating multiple sets of data files which simulate replicates in a multi-group comparison. These modules include abilities to set within and between-group variability as well as simulate missing data in both a random and group-wise manner.\n\n## Getting started\n\nSynthedia can be used by downloading and installing the package or through our web server which can be accessed [here](https://synthedia.org/). Please note that producing synthetic data is a time-consuming task and capacity on our server is limited. In most cases, it will be faster to install synthedia on your own computer as this can take advantage of multiple processing cores.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install via pip\n\nCreate a virtual environment (optional):\n```\nvirtualenv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\nNote that the [pyOpenMS](https://pyopenms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) dependency of synthedia requires python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9. If you have multiple python versions installed, you can construct virtual environments with different versions by:\n```\nvirtualenv venv --python=/path/to/python3.X\n```\nOn linux systems, the path is usually ```/usr/bin/pythonX.X```\n\nInstall synthedia using ```pip```\n```\npip install synthedia\n```\n\n\n### Install from source\nClone the repo:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mgleeming/synthedia.git\ncd synthedia\n```\nCreate a virtual environment (optional):\n```\nvirtualenv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\nNote that the [pyOpenMS](https://pyopenms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) dependency of synthedia requires python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9. If you have multiple python versions installed, you can construct virtual environments with different versions by:\n```\nvirtualenv venv --python=/path/to/python3.X\n```\nOn linux systems, the path is usually ```/usr/bin/pythonX.X```\n\nInstall synthedia:\n```\npip install .\n```\n\nSynthedia can then be invoked from the command line by:\n```\nsynthedia [COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS]\n```\n\nOptionally, you can run the Synthedia integration test to check that everything is working:\n```\npip install pytest\npytest -v\n```\n\n## Input data types\n\nTo create synthetic data, synthedia requires information about peptide fragmentation patterns and some metric as to relative retention time. These can be supplied by either a:\n  - [Prosit](https://www.proteomicsdb.org/prosit/)-predicted spectral library\n  - MaxQuant 'txt' directory\n\n#### Prosit libraries\n\n[Prosit](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0426-7) is a machine learning-based application that predicts MS/MS fragmentation patterns for input peptide sequences. Input sequences can be arbitrary and do not necessarily need to originate from any specific organism or protein. Prosit will generate an output file that contains predicted abundances for peptide sequence ions.\n\nTo create a Synthedia-compatible Prosit spectral library:\n  1. Go to https://www.proteomicsdb.org/prosit/\n  2. Navigate to 'Spectral Library'\n  3. Upload your target peptide list as described in the Prosit documentation\n  4. **IMPORTANT**: under the 'Output format' header (just prior to submitting the Prosit task), ensure that **Generic Text** is selected\n\nOnce processing is complete, the resulting file can be used with Synthedia\n\nWhen Prosit inputs are given, Synthedia models peptide precursor abundances using a Gaussian distribution of Log2 instnsities which approximates the disributions typically observed upon anlysis of real data. The parameters of this distribution (mean and standard deviation) can be specified with the ```--prosit_peptide_abundance_mean``` and ```--prosit_peptide_abundance_stdev``` parameters which have defaults of 22 and 3 respectively.\n\n\n#### MaxQuant 'txt' directories\n\nAs an alternative to Prosit, Synthedia can read and simulate DIA data based upon the MaxQuant processing results of a file acquired using a Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) strategy. In this case, peptide fragment ions are generated based on the matched ions for a PSM reported in the MaxQuant ```msms.txt``` file from the ```Masses``` and ```Intensities``` columns. Note: these are only those fragment ions that MaxQuant assigns as matching a given peptide - they may not necessarily provide a 'full' sequence coverage and may not be correctly assigned in some cases.\n\nSynthedia offers options to filter reverse and contaminant peptides as well as filter PSMs by Posterior Error Probability (PEP) values.\n\n\n## DIA acquisition strategies\n\nDIA-LC-MS/MS data can be acquired in many ways. The default invocation of synthedia creates non-overlapping, 30 Th windows between m/z 350 and m/z 1600. To simulate data using different DIA acquisition strategies, a file defining the acquisition schema can be supplied. An example acquisition schema file and blank template are provided in the ```templates``` directory.\n\n## Decoy signals\n\nLC-MS/MS analysis of bottom-up proteomics samples can be complicated by the presence of ions derived from non-peptide sample contaminants. To mimic this, decoy ions can be simulated together with peptide signals by specifying a decoy database in NIST '.msp' format. See the section 'NIST Text Format of Individual Spectra' in [this document](https://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/docs/Ver20Man_11.pdf) for details on the .msp format.\n\nCustom .msp files can be specified or pre-prepared files can be dowloaded from [MS-DIAL](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html#MSP). The Synthedia web server uses the \"All public MS/MS (13,303 unique compounds)\" file from [MS-DIAL](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html#MSP).\n\nThe number of decoy peaks to simulate, as well as the maximum number of fragments to simulate per decoy, can be specified throught the command line arguments ```num_decoys``` and ```simulate_top_n_decoy_fragments```.\n\n## Compatibility of Synthedia mzML files with other softeare\n\nThe mzML files generated with Synthedia have been tested with:\n\n- DIA-NN\n- EncyclopeDIA\n- DIAUmppire\n- Skyline\n- OpenMS/ToppView\n- MSConvert\n\nThe mzML files are known to not be compatible with MaxQuant (at least as at MaxQuant Version 2.0.3.0)\n\n## Notes about the resulting data\n\n### Peptide vs protein abundances\nIn a real experiment, all peptides from an up-regulated protein should be observed with increased abundance compared to a control group. Synthedia models ion abundances at the peptide level only. This means that, in the case of a two-group simulation, peptides from the same protein may have very different (even opposing) directions of abundance change between groups. This is primarily because the Prosit input type (which is preferred) does not contain mappings between peptides and input proteins and we wished to maintain the ability to simulated arbitrary peptide data.\n\nAs a result of this, if mzML files generated with synthedia are analysed with DIA analysis software, the main comparison in abundances should be made at the peptide level.\n\n### Synthetic vs real data\n\nWhile we have endeavoured to provide a range of options that allow for simulation of a broad range of chromatographic and mass spectral variables, many experimental processes are not modelled which will cause deviations between simulated and real data. As such, users are warned that simulations with Synthedia do not completely re-create experimental complexity and should be used as an investigational tool only.\n\nAs an example, Synthedia offers the capability to simulate the same set of precursors as if acquired on different length chromatographic gradients. This means that data acquired on a lengthy gradients could be reconstructed to approximate acquisition on shorter gradients. In these cases, Synthedia simply models spectra containing signals from many peptides as a simple superposition of their individual signals. In reality however, ion supression effects would result in data that may look substantially different from that which would be produced if a comparable experimental workflow were to be executed.\n\n### Post-translational modifications\n\nSynthedia currently has very limited support for simulating peptides with post-translational modifications. Currently, all cysteine residues are assumed to be modified by carbamidomethylation. No other post-translational modifications are supported.\n\n## Usage\n\nA basic invokation of synthedia using a MaxQuant input directory and accepting all other parameters as default is below:\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt\n```\nThis will create a directory at the current working directory called 'output' containing the processing results.\n\nNote that the default invocation will produce mzML files with profile peaks at both MS1 and MS2 levels. To create centroided data (which is significantly faster):\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --centroid_ms1 --centroid_ms2\n```\n\nTo create profile MS1 and centroid MS2 data:\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --centroid_ms2\n```\n\nTo plot diagnostic graphics and provide a custom path to an output directory:\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --all --out_dir /path/to/out/directory\n```\n\nTo provide a custom acquisition schema:\n```\npython synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --acquisition_schema /path/to/acquisition_schema.csv\n```\n\nTo simulate MaxQuant reuslts on a shorter chromatographic gradient:\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --new_run_length 10\n```\n\nTo simulate a two group analysis with three replicates per group:\n```\nsynthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --n_groups 2 --samples_per_group 3\n```\n\nRather than specifying arguments on the commmand line, processing parameters can by placed into a ```.yaml``` file and then supplied as:\n```\nsynthedia --config /path/to/params.yaml\n```\n\nAdditional or updated parameters can be specified:\n```\nsynthedia --config /path/to/params.yaml  --ms1_resolution 100000\n```\nIn this case the ```ms1_resolution``` parameter value given on the command line is used even if a different value is given in ```/path/to/params.yaml```. That is, the heirarchy is command line parameter > config.yaml > synthedia default.\n\nTo quickly see the impact of changing input parameters, a single peptide ion can be modelled from the command line and no additional input files are required (i.e. the requirement for a Prosit or MaxQuant input is removed):\n```\nsynthedia --preview --preview_sequence PEPTIDE --preview_charge 2\n```\n\nFor example, to model a broad chromatographic peak, the mean peak full-width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) can be increased:\n```\nsynthedia --preview --preview_sequence PEPTIDE --preview_charge 2 --rt_peak_fwhm_distribution_mean 10\n```\nA series of plots are generated in the directiry specified in ```--out_dir``` to visualise the change.\n\n## Synthedia parameter reference\n    usage: synthedia [-h] [--mq_txt_dir MQ_TXT_DIR] [--prosit PROSIT]\n                 [--prosit_peptide_abundance_model PROSIT_PEPTIDE_ABUNDANCE_MODEL]\n                 [--prosit_peptide_abundance_mean PROSIT_PEPTIDE_ABUNDANCE_MEAN]\n                 [--prosit_peptide_abundance_stdev PROSIT_PEPTIDE_ABUNDANCE_STDEV]\n                 [--prosit_peptide_abundance_emg_k PROSIT_PEPTIDE_ABUNDANCE_EMG_K]\n                 [--acquisition_schema ACQUISITION_SCHEMA]\n                 [--use_existing_peptide_file USE_EXISTING_PEPTIDE_FILE] [--out_dir OUT_DIR]\n                 [--output_label OUTPUT_LABEL] [--config CONFIG] [--silent] [--write_params]\n                 [--mq_pep_threshold MQ_PEP_THRESHOLD] [--filterTerm FILTERTERM]\n                 [--num_processors NUM_PROCESSORS] [--ms1_min_mz MS1_MIN_MZ]\n                 [--ms1_max_mz MS1_MAX_MZ] [--ms2_min_mz MS2_MIN_MZ] [--ms2_max_mz MS2_MAX_MZ]\n                 [--ms1_resolution MS1_RESOLUTION] [--ms2_resolution MS2_RESOLUTION]\n                 [--ms1_scan_duration MS1_SCAN_DURATION] [--ms2_scan_duration MS2_SCAN_DURATION]\n                 [--isolation_window ISOLATION_WINDOW] [--resolution_at RESOLUTION_AT]\n                 [--n_points_gt_fwhm N_POINTS_GT_FWHM] [--esi_instability ESI_INSTABILITY]\n                 [--ms1_ppm_error_mean MS1_PPM_ERROR_MEAN]\n                 [--ms1_ppm_error_stdev MS1_PPM_ERROR_STDEV]\n                 [--ms2_ppm_error_mean MS2_PPM_ERROR_MEAN]\n                 [--ms2_ppm_error_stdev MS2_PPM_ERROR_STDEV]\n                 [--rt_peak_fwhm_distribution_model RT_PEAK_FWHM_DISTRIBUTION_MODEL]\n                 [--rt_peak_fwhm_distribution_mean RT_PEAK_FWHM_DISTRIBUTION_MEAN]\n                 [--rt_peak_fwhm_distribution_stdev RT_PEAK_FWHM_DISTRIBUTION_STDEV]\n                 [--rt_peak_fwhm_distribution_emg_k RT_PEAK_FWHM_DISTRIBUTION_EMG_K]\n                 [--min_rt_peak_fwhm MIN_RT_PEAK_FWHM] [--original_run_length ORIGINAL_RUN_LENGTH]\n                 [--new_run_length NEW_RUN_LENGTH] [--rt_buffer RT_BUFFER]\n                 [--rt_instability RT_INSTABILITY] [--ms1_min_peak_intensity MS1_MIN_PEAK_INTENSITY]\n                 [--ms2_min_peak_intensity MS2_MIN_PEAK_INTENSITY] [--centroid_ms1] [--centroid_ms2]\n                 [--write_empty_spectra] [--mz_peak_model MZ_PEAK_MODEL]\n                 [--rt_peak_model RT_PEAK_MODEL] [--mz_emg_k MZ_EMG_K] [--rt_emg_k RT_EMG_K]\n                 [--prob_missing_in_sample PROB_MISSING_IN_SAMPLE]\n                 [--prob_missing_in_group PROB_MISSING_IN_GROUP] [--no_isotopes] [--tic] [--schema]\n                 [--all] [--n_groups N_GROUPS] [--samples_per_group SAMPLES_PER_GROUP]\n                 [--between_group_stdev BETWEEN_GROUP_STDEV]\n                 [--within_group_stdev WITHIN_GROUP_STDEV] [--decoy_msp_file DECOY_MSP_FILE]\n                 [--num_decoys NUM_DECOYS]\n                 [--simulate_top_n_decoy_fragments SIMULATE_TOP_N_DECOY_FRAGMENTS]\n                 [--decoy_abundance_mean DECOY_ABUNDANCE_MEAN]\n                 [--decoy_abundance_stdev DECOY_ABUNDANCE_STDEV] [--preview]\n                 [--preview_sequence PREVIEW_SEQUENCE] [--preview_charge PREVIEW_CHARGE]\n                 [--preview_abundance PREVIEW_ABUNDANCE]\n\n      Generate synthetic DIA LC-MS/MS bottom up proteomics data with known composition.\n\n      optional arguments:\n        -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\n      Input/Output:\n        --mq_txt_dir MQ_TXT_DIR\n                              Path to MaxQuat \"txt\" directory.\n        --prosit PROSIT       Path to prosit prediction library.\n        --prosit_peptide_abundance_model PROSIT_PEPTIDE_ABUNDANCE_MODEL\n                              The model from which log2 abundance values are drawn to generate abundances\n                              for prosit precursors.
