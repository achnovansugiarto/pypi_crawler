    "description": "# Camelot: A Pythonic Frame Representation System\n\nCamelot is a Frame Representation System (FRS) for Python. It is\ninspired by the Ocelot FRS which powers the Pathway Tools software\nfrom SRI International's Bioinformatcs Research Group. Thus, it is\ncalled 'Camelot' as a Pythonic Ocelot.\n\n## Current Capabilities\n\n* Slot annotations\n\n* Transitive Closure for is-a (i.e., subsumption) and part-of relationships\n\n* Supports the import of KBs in the attribute-value format of\n  Pathway/Genome Databases as generated by Pathway Tools\n\n* Implementation of select functions from the Pathway Tools API\n\n* Enrichment Analysis\n\n\n## Planned Capabilities\n\n* Visualization of Ontology structure using GraphViz\n\n* Ties to BioPython for handling sequence data\n\n* Support data loaders for GO, ENZYME, NCBI Taxonomy DB, and UniProt\n\n## How to Build\n\nRun the following at the top of the package repository:\n\n```\nmake clean-package\nmake create-package\n```\n\n## How to Install\n\n\nCamelot FRS is released as a Python package. It can easily be\ninstalled using FIXME.\n\nTo manually install the package from the Git repository, do the\nfollowing at the top-level of the repository:\n\n```\nmake install-package\n```\n\nFor development purposes, the following will install an 'editable'\nversion of the package:\n\n```\nmake install-dev-package\n```\n\n## A Simple Tutorial\n\n\n```\n## Import Camelot functions for working with ontology:\nfrom camelot_frs.pgdb_loader import load_pgdb\nfrom camelot_frs.pgdb_api    import reactions_of_compound\nfrom camelot_frs.camelot_frs import get_kb, get_frame, get_frames, get_frame_all_parents, get_frame_all_children\n\n## Load MetaCyc:\nload_pgdb(\"/home/ubuntu/data/metacyc/23.1/data\")\n\n## Assign the MetaCyc Knowledge Base (KB) to a variable:\nmetaKB = get_kb('META')\n\n### Find all reactions of 'ACET':\n\n## Get the frame for acetic acid:\nacet = get_frame(metaKB, 'ACET')\n\n## Get all reactions that directly \n\n## Get all reactions that indirectly consume acetic acid:\n## (Either an instance or sub-class or a super-class of acetic acid is consumed in the reaction)\nindirect_rxns = reactions_of_compound(acet, generic_rxns_p=True, consumed_p=True)\n```\n\n## A Tutorial using MetaCyc\n\n\n## Design Decisions\n\nFrom my years of experience working with the Ocelot DB, I had some\ndefinite opinions about how to design the user experience with Camelot. The\nfollowing is a summary of some of these decisions:\n\n* All KBs and frames are objects\n* There are no symbol-equivalent representations of KBs or frames\n* Since a user has to deal with objects directly, objects have a\n  rational and human-readable display form, such as 'frame:proton' for\n  a proton object, rather than '(Python object 0x399823498)'\n* Since all frames are represented as objects, each object points\n  specifically to the KB that it comes from (and every KB has a link\n  to the frames it contains). Only frame look-up functions require the\n  KB as a co-argument. This greatly simplifies the code.\n* KB-agnostic code is kept strictly separate from KB-specific code\n  (e.g., the PGDB Loader)\n* Core algorithms for processing ontology datastructures are separated\n  out from the 'business logic' \n* Instead of having separate functions for dealing with classes versus\n  instances, functions are written to be as generic as possible, and\n  named arguments are optional for specifying between them (e.g.,\n  `get_frame_all_children` can specify optionally to return only\n  classes, only instances, or both, which is the default)\n* All slots are lists, even if they usually only have a single value\n* Accessing a non-existent slot throws an error. Schema violations\n  should cause code to fail and fail early\n\n\n",
