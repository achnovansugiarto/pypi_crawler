You can keep your buildout in sync with your Eclipse workspace with one\n  command.\n\n* Set Eclipse preferences suitable for Plone/Zope development \n\t\n\t* Tab stops to 8 spaces\n\t\n\t* File associations: .pt, .dtml, .zcml, etc.\n\t\n\t* Version control ignores (do not commit egg-info folders)\n\t\n\t* Text encoding settings to UTF-8\n\n* Different UI Run shortcuts are automatically created\n\n        * IDE compatible Zope launching script (retains console output by not making Zope to fork on start-up)\n\n        * Plone local instance \n\n        * Unit test runners for all projects\n\n        * Run buildout\n        \n        * Open Zope debug shell\n        \n        * Edit buildout.cfg\n\nPrerequirements\n----------------\n\nWhat you need to know before messing with this script\n\n* Basic Plone development and Eclipse usage knowledge \n\n        * What is `buildout <http://www.buildout.org/>`_ and buildout folder structure\n        \n        * How to use `Eclipse IDE <http://www.eclipse.org/>`_\n                \n\nInstallation\n------------ \n\n**Note**: Currently we can't support installation as Python egg or Eclipse plug-in bundle. This is being worked out. \n\n* Install `Aptana Studio <http://www.aptana.org/>`_ with PyDev and Subclipse plug-ins. Standalone Aptana installation\n  is recommended as it is the fastest way to get started - you do not need to manually gather and install plug-ins.\n  \n        * Standard Eclipse standalone installation seems to have some componenent version compatibility issues.\n          Aptana is recommended way to install Eclipse for Python development.       \n\n* Install `Python Monkey <http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/PythonMonkey>`_ and restart Eclipse \n\n* Checkout this project using Subclipse/Subversive to Eclipse workspace as a project\n\n\t* Repository URL: https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective\n\t\n\t* Project path: collective.eclipsescripts/trunk\n\t\n\t* Alternatively copy Python egg contents to script/ folders under some of your Eclipse projects \n\n* Immediately menu *Scripts* should appear in the top menu bar  \n\n* Open scripts in Python editor to see comments what they do\n\n* Execute scripts by picking then from *Scripts* menubar\n\n* Open console to see possible sccript output\n\n\t* Choose menu *Window* -> *Show View* -> *Console*. Then choose Eclipse Monkey Console\n\t  from alternative console views. Note: console might not be available until you have \n\t  run one of the scripts.\n\t\nUsage\n-----\n\n* Create Plone 3 buildout - use your favorite buildout integrated tool to manage source code checkout under src/.\n  E.g. 'Mr. Developer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer>`_\n   \n* Launch Eclipse - Switch workspace and choose src/ folder in buildout as the workspace location\n\n* Configure Python 2.4 (for Plone 3.x) in preferences\n\n* Set workspace settings - Choose *Scripts* -> *Plone* -> *Set Plone Preferences*\n\n* Choose *Scripts* -> *Plone* -> *Import src folder as workspace* to import all checked out projects  \n  under src/ as Eclipse projects. If you add new projects you can run this command without losing\n  manual changes made to the projects.\n  \n        * Plone instance and projects will have launchers created in *Run configurations...* menu\n        \n        * Optionally, if you are using `collective.recipe.omelette <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.omelette>`_\n          all Plone packages are added under PyDev builders and code autocompletion will work for the projects\n  \n* Choose *Scripts* -> *Plone* -> *Edit buildout.cfg* if you wish to edit buildout.cfg\n\t\nHow it works\n-------------\n\n`Python Monkey exposes <http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/PythonMonkey>`_ Eclipse process to Python scripting environment \nthrough `Jython run-time <http://www.jython.org/>`_.\nEverything what can be done by Eclipse plug-ins and Java development can be now done with few lines of Python code.\nThis makes the development of integration options for Eclipse real quick and dirty. \n\nAlso, you do not need to have a separate Eclipse project for your scripts. You can keep your scripts\nwithin any Eclipse project in *scripts* top level folder.\n\nFor more information\n--------------------\n\n* http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Adding_metadata_to_an_Eclipse_Monkey_script\n\n* http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp\n\nPossible future features\n------------------------\n\n* Deploy as real Eclipse plug-in\n\n* paster integration: add view, content types directly from IDE\n\n* deployment integration \n\nAuthor\n------\n\n`mFabrik Research Oy <mailto:info@mfabrik.com>`_ - Python and Plone professionals for hire.\n\n* `mFabrik web site <http://mfabrik.com>`_  (`In Finnish <http://mfabrik.fi>`_)\n\n* `mFabrik mobile site <http://mfabrik.mobi>`_ \n\n* `Blog <http://blog.mfabrik.com>`_\n\n* `More about Plone <http://mfabrik.com/technology/technologies/content-management-cms/plone>`_",
