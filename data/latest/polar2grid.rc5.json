Due to the projects sharing a lot of internal functionality\ntheir code bases are stored in the same code repository.\nBoth projects are created by scientists and software developers at the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at\nthe University of Wisconsin - Madison. Polar2Grid is distributed as part of the\n`Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP) <http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/cspp/>`_ for\nprocessing of data received via direct broadcast antennas. Geo2Grid is distributed as part of the\n`CSPP Geo <http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/csppgeo/>`_ project for processing of data received via direct broadcast\nantennas. Although both projects were created to serve the direct\nbroadcast community, they can be used on most archived data files.\nSee the documentation for specific functionality.\n\n`Polar2Grid Documentation <http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/software/polar2grid/>`_\n\n`Geo2Grid Documentation <http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/software/geo2grid/>`_\n\n`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/ssec/polar2grid>`_\n\n`Polar2Grid Contact <http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/contact-form/index.php?name=CSPP%20Questions>`__\n\n`CSPP LEO Forum <https://forums.ssec.wisc.edu/viewforum.php?f=66>`_\n\n`CSPP Geo Forum <https://forums.ssec.wisc.edu/viewforum.php?f=67>`_\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIt is recommended that users use the official Polar2Grid/Geo2Grid release compatible\nwith RHEL6+ systems whenever possible. This tarball is available through the\nCSPP team's website (see above). To install the Polar2Grid python package (used for Polar2Grid and Geo2Grid)\nfrom source, run::\n\n    pip install .\n\nOther Installation Methods\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe \"polar2grid\" package that powers the official CSPP Polar2Grid and CSPP Geo\nGeo2Grid all-in-one tarballs is also released as a traditional python package\non PyPI and conda-forge. Installing the package in this way allows Polar2Grid\nand Geo2Grid functionality to be used from non-Linux systems.\nThe python package can be installed into your normal Python 3.8+\nenvironment by doing the following in a conda environment (recommended):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge polar2grid\n\nOr with pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install polar2grid\n\nOnce the package is installed the regular \"geo2grid.sh\" and \"polar2grid.sh\"\nscripts are available. For systems without the bash shell available there are\nalso \"geo2grid\" and \"polar2grid\" wrapper scripts available. For example:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    polar2grid -h\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFeel free to submit issues and pull requests on Github or contact us (see above) about more involved feature requests.\nWe do ask that before you add features yourself or fix complex issues that you contact us in some way. Both projects\nare in active development and features and fixes are added all the time. Developers should see the\n`Developer's Guide <http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/software/polar2grid/dev_guide/>`_ for more information on the internals\nof both projects.\n\nDirectories\n-----------\n\nThe majority of Polar2Grid is written in python, but some of the components may use third-party C or Fortran binaries\nfor various processing algorithms.\nTo make it easier to create our CSPP distribution (aka the software bundle) and for any pure python users we provide\nthe source for some of these executables in the root of the repository.\n\n- polar2grid: The Polar2Grid python package.\n- swbundle: Helper scripts and other files provided in the Polar2Grid Software Bundle released by the CSPP team.\n- modis_crefl: Copy of the MODIS Corrected Reflectance software (CREFL) that includes updates for building with Makefile\n- viirs_crefl: Copy of the VIIRS Corrected Reflectance software (CREFL) that includes updates for building with Makefile\n- ms2gt: Custom version of the `ms2gt <http://nsidc.org/data/modis/ms2gt/>`_ software package with bug fixes and\n         optimizations. This is not used as of P2Gv2.0 and will be removed in future revisions.\n- etc: Configuration files used to customize the SatPy package for Polar2Grid users.\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\n\n::\n\n    Copyright (C) 2012-2021 Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC), University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
