    "description": "==========\n ical2org\n==========\n\nical2org is a command line tool for exporting data from the Mac OS X\napplication iCal so it can be used with the emacs tool `org-mode`_.\nData transfer is one-way only (from iCal to emacs), and is intended to\nbe used to show alarms and scheduled events managed by iCal within\norg's agenda view.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nical2org is distributed as a set of `Python`_ source files, and\nrequires that Python already be installed.  The source distribution is\ncreated using `Distribute`_, which will be installed with ical2org.\n\nQuick Install\n-------------\n\nUse normal Python application steps to install ical2org::\n\n    $ pip install ical2org\n\nor::\n\n    $ easy_install ical2org\n\nThe other dependencies (`pytz`_ and `vobject`_) will be installed\nautomatically.\n\nFrom Source\n-----------\n\n1. Download and install the dependencies.\n\n   * `pytz`_\n   * `vobject`_\n\n2. Download the latest release tarball from the `project home page\n   <http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/ical2org/>`_.\n\n3. Unpack the files::\n\n   $ tar zxvf ical2org-VERSION.tar.gz\n\n4. Run the installation script::\n\n   $ cd ical2org-VERSION\n   $ python setup.py install\n\n   .. note:: Some systems may require super-user privileges to install.\n\n\nGenerating org-mode Files\n=========================\n\nWhile ical2org supports multiple output formats, the default is an\norg-mode outline.  Each calendar entry includes the summary, location,\ndate and time, and complete description (useful for searching).\n\nFor example, to extract the entries from a calendar called \"Meetup:\nPython\", you would run::\n\n    $ ical2org \"Meetup: Python\"\n    Starting 14 days ago at 2010-01-03 00:00:00-05:00\n    Ending 30 days from now at 2010-02-17 00:00:00-05:00\n    Processing: Meetup: Python\n      Python Atlanta February Meetup\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    * Meetup: Python\t:clubs:\n      :CATEGORY: Personal\n    ** Python Atlanta February Meetup\n       <2010-02-11 Thu 19:30-21:30>\n       - PyAtl: Atlanta Python Programmers\n         \n         After an optional 6pm dinner at Figo Pasta at the corner of\n         Howell Mill Road and Huff Road, we will meet as usual in the\n         spacious and comfortable auditorium of the GTRI Food\n         Processing Building at 7:30pm for our monthly meeting.\n         \n         Topics for this meeting:\n         \n         Brandon Rhodes will give his PyCon talk: \"Learning Hosting\n         Best-Practices From WebFaction\"\n         \n         Atlanta, GA  30318 - USA\n         \n         Thursday, February 11 at 7:30 PM\n         \n         Photo: http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/3/5/event_5238229.jpeg\n         \n         Attending: 3\n         \n         Details: http://www.meetup.com/python-atlanta/calendar/12325308/\n\nOutput is encoded as UTF-8, which may not work with Unix pipes and\nshell redirection.  To save the output to a file instead of having it\nprinted to standard output, use the ``-o`` option.\n\nBy default, ical2org processes all of the calendars which are\ndisplayed in iCal.  Hidden calendars are ignored unless you give their\nname on the command line.\n\nGenerating Diary Files\n======================\n\nThe default output format uses org's outline structure.  If you would\nrather use emacs' diary-mode, use ``-f diary`` to switch modes.  The\ndiary entries do not include the full text of the event.\n\nRecommended Use\n===============\n\nThe recommended way to use ical2org is to export your iCal data at\nleast every day.  That gives you a moving window of fresh data, since\nthe date range for export is limited.  Save the output to a file\n(e.g., ``~/Documents/Notes/calendar.org``) and add the file to org's\nlist of inputs for building agenda views.\n\nIf you use org-mode for taking notes in meetings, refile each event as\nyou make notes to avoid overwriting it the next time your calendars\nare exported.\n\nFor example, you might run a command like::\n\n    $ ical2org -o ~/Documents/Notes/calendar.org -b 30 -e 30\n\nto export the data starting 30 days ago and ending 30 days from today\nto the file ``calendar.org``.\n\nRecurring Events\n================\n\nRecurring events in iCal are \"exploded\" to create separate entries in\nthe output.  This makes it easy to refile an event when you add notes,\nwithout having the notes from one meeting occurance appear on the\nwrong date.\n\nCommand Line Options\n====================\n\n-h                    show this help message and exit\n-c CONFIG_FILENAME, --config=CONFIG_FILENAME\n                      Configuration file name. Defaults to ~/.ical2org\n-b DAYS_AGO, --begin=DAYS_AGO, --days-ago=DAYS_AGO\n                      Number of days back in time to search. Defaults to 14.\n-e DAYS_AHEAD, --end=DAYS_AHEAD, --days-ahead=DAYS_AHEAD\n                      Number of days forward in time to search. Defaults to\n                      30.\n-v, --verbose         Increase verbose level\n-q, --quiet           Turn off verbose output\n-o OUTPUT_FILE_NAME, --output-file=OUTPUT_FILE_NAME\n                      Write the output to the named file instead of stdout\n--all                 Include all calendars, not just active.\n--input-directory=INPUT_DIRECTORY\n                      Directory containing calendars. Defaults to\n                      ~/Library/Calendars.\n-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT\n                      Output format. One of ['org', 'diary'].
