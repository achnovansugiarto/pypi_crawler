    "description": "Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nMarine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), also known as the GeoEco Python \r\npackage, is an open source geoprocessing toolbox designed for coastal and \r\nmarine researchers and GIS analysts who work with spatially-explicit ecological \r\nand oceanographic data in scientific or management workflows. MGET includes \r\nover 180 tools useful for a variety of tasks, such as converting oceanographic \r\ndata to ArcGIS formats, identifying fronts in sea surface temperature images, \r\nfitting and evaluating statistical models such as GAMs and GLMs by integrating \r\nArcGIS with the R statistics program, analyzing coral reef connectivity by \r\nsimulating hydrodynamic larval dispersal, and building grids that summarize \r\nfishing effort, CPUE and other statistics. Currently under development are \r\ntools for identifying rings and eddy cores in sea surface height images, for \r\nanalyzing connectivity networks, for estimating fishing effort when no effort \r\ndata are available, for predicting hard bottom habitat from coarse grain \r\nbathymetry, and much more. \r\n\r\nAlthough \"Marine\" is the first word in the title, many tools are not specific \r\nto marine problems. You may find these tools useful in a variety of situations.\r\n\r\nMGET may be accessed from ArcGIS as a toolbox in the ArcToolbox window and from \r\nprogramming languages as a set of Python modules and COM components. A \"tool\" \r\nin MGET corresponds to a method of a Python class.\r\n\r\nDownload and Installation\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nDownload from the `MGET home page <http://code.env.duke.edu/projects/mget>`_\r\n(the files are too large to be hosted by PyPI).\r\n\r\nPlease read the installation instructions `here \r\n<http://code.env.duke.edu/projects/mget/browser/MGET/Tags/GeoEco-\r\n0.7/PythonPackage/dist/TracOnlineDocumentation/Documentation/GettingStarted.html\r\n?format=raw#Installation>`_.\r\n\r\nMinimum requirements:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft Windows XP or later\r\n* Python 2.4 or 2.5\r\n* Python for Windows Extensions (the pywin32 package)\r\n\r\nMost tools also require ArcGIS 9.1 or later. Some tools require other free \r\nsoftware, such as R.\r\n\r\nFor More Information\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nVisit our home page. Newer releases may be available on the home page.",
