Flutterwave for business [API Keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/authentication)\n2. Acceptable Python versions: >=2.7, !=3.0.\\*, !=3.1.\\*, !=3.2.\\*, !=3.3.\\*, !=3.4.\\*\n\n\n## Installation\nTo install the library, run\n\n```sh\npip install rave_python\n```\n\nNote: This is currently under active development\n\n\n## Initialization\n\n### Import Package\nThe base class for this package is 'Rave'. To use this class, add:\n\n```py\nfrom rave_python import Rave\n```\n\n#### To instantiate in sandbox:\nTo use Rave, instantiate the Rave class with your public key. We recommend that you store your secret key in an environment variable named, ```RAVE_SECRET_KEY```. Instantiating your rave object is therefore as simple as:\n\n```py\nrave = Rave(\"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\")\n```\n\n####  To instantiate without environment variables (Sandbox):\nIf you choose not to store your secret key in an environment variable, we do provide a ```usingEnv``` flag which can be set to ```False```, but please be warned, do not use this package without environment variables in production\n\n```py\nrave = Rave(\"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\", \"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\", usingEnv = False)\n```\n\n\n#### To instantiate in production:\nTo initialize in production, simply set the ```production``` flag to ```True```. It is highly discouraged but if you choose to not use environment variables, you can do so in the same way mentioned above.\n\n```py\nrave = Rave(\"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\", production=True)\n```\n\n\n\n# Usage\nThis is the documentation for all of the components of rave_python\n\n## ```rave.Card```\nThis is used to facilitate card transactions.\n\n**Functions included:**\n\n* ```.charge```\n\n* ```.validate```\n\n* ```.verify```\n\n* ```.refund```\n\n* ```.getTypeOfArgsRequired```\n\n* ```.updatePayload```\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.charge(payload)```\nThis is called to start a card transaction. The payload should be a dictionary containing card information. It should have the parameters:\n\n* ```cardno```,\n\n* ```cvv```, \n\n* ```currency```, \n\n* ```country```, \n\n* ```expirymonth```, \n\n* ```expiryyear```, \n\n* ```amount```, \n\n* ```email```, \n\n* ```phonenumber```,\n\n* ```firstname```, \n\n* ```lastname```, \n\n* ```IP```\n\nOptionally, you can add a custom transaction reference using the ```txRef``` parameter. Note that if you do not specify one, it would be automatically generated. We do provide a function for generating transaction references in the [Misc library](https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python/blob/master/rave_python/rave_misc.py).\n\n\nA sample call is:\n\n```py\nres = rave.Card.charge(payload)\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dictionary. A sample response is:\n\n```py\n {'validationRequired': True, 'suggestedAuth': u'PIN', 'flwRef': None, 'authUrl': None, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-1538095398058'}\n ```\n\nThis call raises a ```CardChargeError``` if there was a problem processing your transaction. The ```CardChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:\n\n```py\ntry: \n    #Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n\nA sample ``` e.err ``` contains:\n\n```py\n{'error': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530897824739', 'flwRef': None, 'errMsg': 'Sorry, that card number is invalid, please check and try again'}\n```\n\n\n<br>\n\n### ```rave.Misc.updatePayload(authMethod, payload, arg)```\n\nDepending on the suggestedAuth from the charge call, you may need to update the payload with a pin or address. To know which type of authentication you would require, simply call ```rave.Card.getTypeOfArgsRequired(suggestedAuth)```. This returns either ```pin``` or ```address```. \n\nIn the case of ```pin```, you are required to call ```rave.Card.updatePayload(suggestedAuth, payload, pin=\"THE_CUSTOMER_PIN\")```. \n\nIn the case of ```address```, you are required to call ```rave.Card.updatePayload(suggestedAuth, payload, address={ THE_ADDRESS_DICTIONARY })```\n\nA typical address dictionary includes the following parameters:\n\n```billingzip```, \n\n```billingcity```,\n\n```billingaddress```, \n \n```billingstate```,\n \n```billingcountry```\n\n**Note:**\n```suggestedAuth``` is the suggestedAuth returned from the initial charge call and ```payload``` is the original payload\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.validate(txRef)```\n\nAfter a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the ```validationRequired``` key in the ```res``` of the charge call.\n\nTo validate, you need to pass the ```flwRef``` from the ```res``` of the charge call as well as the OTP.\n\nA sample validate call is: \n\n```py\nres2 = rave.Card.validate(res[\"flwRef\"], \"12345\")\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dictionary containing the ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` among others if successful. \n\nThis call raises a ```TransactionValidationError``` if the OTP is not correct or there was a problem processing your request. \n\nTo handle this, write:\n\n```py\ntry:\n    # Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.TransactionValidationError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n\nA sample ``` e.err ``` contains:\n\n```py\n{'error': True, 'txRef': None, 'flwRef': 'FLW-MOCK-a7911408bd7f55f89f0211819d6fd370', 'errMsg': 'otp is required'}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.verify(txRef)```\n\nYou can call this to check if your transaction was completed successfully. You have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of charging. This is the ```txRef``` in the ```res``` parameter returned any of the calls (```charge``` or ```validate```). \n\nA sample verify call is:\n\n```py\nres = rave.Card.verify(data[\"txRef\"])\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dict with ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` and ```transactionComplete``` which indicates whether the transaction was completed successfully. \n\nSample\n```py\n{'flwRef': None, 'cardToken': u'flw-t1nf-5b0f12d565cd961f73c51370b1340f1f-m03k', 'chargedAmount': 100, 'amount': 100, 'transactionComplete': True, 'error': False, 'txRef': u'MC-1538095718251'}\n```\n\n> Please note that after charging a card successfully on rave, if you wish to save the card for further charges, in your verify payment response you will find an object: `\"cardtoken\": \"flw-t0-f6f915f53a094671d98560272572993e-m03k\"`.  This is the token you will use for card tokenization. Details are provided below.\n\nIf your call could not be completed successfully, a ```TransactionVerificationError``` is raised.\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.charge(payload_for_saved_card, chargeWithToken=True)```\nThis is called to start a card transaction with a card that has been saved. The payload should be a dictionary containing card information. It should have the parameters:\n\n* ```token```,\n\n* ```country```, \n\n* ```amount```, \n\n* ```email```, \n\n* ```firstname```, \n\n* ```lastname```, \n\n* ```IP```,\n\n* ```txRef```, \n\n* ```currency```\n\n#### NB: email must be the same as before the card was saved\nOptionally, you can add a custom transaction reference using the ```txRef``` parameter. Note that if you do not specify one, it would be automatically generated. We do provide a function for generating transaction references in the [Misc library](https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python/blob/master/rave_python/rave_misc.py).\n\nA sample call is:\n\n```py\nres = rave.Card.charge(payload_for_saved_card, chargeWithToken=True)\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dictionary. A sample response is:\n\n ```py\n {'status': u'success', 'validationRequired': False, 'suggestedAuth': None, 'flwRef': u'FLW-M03K-cdb24d740fb18c242dd277fb1f74d399', 'authUrl': None, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-7666-YU'}\n ```\n\n This call raises a ```CardChargeError``` if a wrong token or email is passed or if there was a problem processing your transaction. The ```CardChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:\n\n```py\ntry: \n    #Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n\nThis call also raises an ```IncompletePaymentDetailsError``` if any of the required parameters are missing. The ```IncompletePaymentDetailsError``` contains information about which parameter was not included in the payload. You can handle this such as:\n\n```py\ntry:\n    #Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.IncompletePaymentDetailsError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n```\n\nOnce this is done, call ```rave.Card.verify``` passing in the ```txRef``` returned in the response to verify the payment. Sample response:\n\n```py\n{'flwRef': None, 'cardToken': u'flw-t1nf-5b0f12d565cd961f73c51370b1340f1f-m03k', 'chargedAmount': 1000, 'amount': 1000, 'transactionComplete': True, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-7666-YU'}\n```\n\n```rave.Card.verify``` raises a ```TransactionVerificationError``` if an invalid ```txRef``` is supplied. You can handle this as such:\n\n```py\ntry: \n    #Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n#### NB: when charging saved cards, you do not need to call rave.card.Validate()\n\n\n### ```.refund(flwRef, amount)```\n\nYou can call this to refund a full or partial amount of a transaction that was completed successfully. You have to pass the flw reference generated at the point of verifing the transaction. This is the ```flwRef``` in the ```res``` parameter returned any of the calls (```charge``` or ```validate```). \n\nA sample verify call is:\n\n```py\nres = rave.Card.refund(data[\"flwRef\"], amount)\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dict with ```status```, ```AmountRefunded```, ```disburse_ref``` and ```disburse_status``` which indicates whether the transaction was completed successfully. \n\nSample\n```py\n(True, {'settlement_id': 'NEW', 'id': 36071, 'AccountId': 49278, 'TransactionId': 1664979, 'FlwRef': 'FLW-MOCK-62986ef948d6dd127102cdb58813d216', 'walletId': 50309, 'AmountRefunded': '5000', 'status': 'completed', 'destination': 'payment_source', 'meta': '{\"source\":\"ledgerbalance\",\"uniquereference\":\"62472228710\"}', 'updatedAt': '2021-01-23T01:27:11.969Z', 'createdAt': '2021-01-23T01:27:08.672Z'})\n```\n\n\n### Complete card charge flow\n\n```py\nfrom rave_python import Rave, RaveExceptions, Misc\nrave = Rave(\"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\", \"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\", usingEnv = False)\n\n# Payload with pin\npayload = {\n  \"cardno\": \"5438898014560229\",\n  \"cvv\": \"890\",\n  \"expirymonth\": \"09\",\n  \"expiryyear\": \"19\",\n  \"amount\": \"10\",\n  \"email\": \"user@gmail.com\",\n  \"phonenumber\": \"0902620185\",\n  \"firstname\": \"temi\",\n  \"lastname\": \"desola\",\n  \"IP\": \"355426087298442\",\n}\n\ntry:\n    res = rave.Card.charge(payload)\n\n    if res[\"suggestedAuth\"]:\n        arg = Misc.getTypeOfArgsRequired(res[\"suggestedAuth\"])\n\n        if arg == \"pin\":\n            Misc.updatePayload(res[\"suggestedAuth\"], payload, pin=\"3310\")\n        if arg == \"address\":\n            Misc.updatePayload(res[\"suggestedAuth\"], payload, address= {\"billingzip\": \"07205\", \"billingcity\": \"Hillside\", \"billingaddress\": \"470 Mundet PI\", \"billingstate\": \"NJ\", \"billingcountry\": \"US\"})\n        \n        res = rave.Card.charge(payload)\n\n    if res[\"validationRequired\"]:\n        rave.Card.validate(res[\"flwRef\"], \"\")\n\n    res = rave.Card.verify(res[\"txRef\"])\n    print(res[\"transactionComplete\"])\n\nexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n\nexcept RaveExceptions.TransactionValidationError as e:\n    print(e.err)\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n\nexcept RaveExceptions.TransactionVerificationError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"txRef\"])\n```\n\n<br><br>\n## ```rave.Account```\nThis is used to facilitate account transactions.\n\n**Functions included:**\n\n* ```.charge```\n\n* ```.validate```\n\n* ```.verify```\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.charge(payload)```\nThis is called to start an account transaction. The payload should be a dictionary containing card information. It should have the parameters:\n\n* ```accountbank```, \n\n* ```accountnumber```, \n\n* ```amount```, \n\n* ```email```, \n\n* ```phonenumber```, \n\n* ```IP```\n\nOptionally, you can add a custom transaction reference using the ```txRef``` parameter. Note that if you do not specify one, it would be automatically generated. We do provide a function for generating transaction references in the [Misc library](https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python/blob/master/rave_python/rave_misc.py).\n\n\nA sample call is:\n\n```py\nres = rave.Account.charge(payload)\n```\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dictionary. A sample response is:\n\n```py\n {'error': False, 'validationRequired': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530899106006', 'flwRef': 'ACHG-1530899109682', 'authUrl': None}\n```\n\n This call raises an ```AccountChargeError``` if there was a problem processing your transaction. The ```AccountChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:\n\n```py\ntry: \n    #Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.AccountChargeError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n\nA sample ``` e.err ``` contains:\n\n```py\n{'error': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530897824739', 'flwRef': None, 'errMsg': 'Sorry, that account number is invalid, please check and try again'}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.validate(txRef)```\n\nAfter a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the ```validationRequired``` key in the ```res``` of the charge call.\n\nIn the case that an ```authUrl``` is returned from your charge call, you may skip the validation step and simply pass your authUrl to the end-user. \n\n```py\nauthUrl = res['authUrl']\n```\n\nTo validate, you need to pass the ```flwRef``` from the ```res``` of the charge call as well as the OTP.\n\nA sample validate call is: \n\n```py\nres2 = rave.Account.validate(res[\"flwRef\"], \"12345\")\n```\n\n\n#### Returns\n\nThis call returns a dictionary containing the ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` among others if successful.\n\nThis call raises a ```TransactionValidationError``` if the OTP is not correct or there was a problem processing your request. \n\nTo handle this, write:\n\n```py\ntry:\n    # Your charge call\nexcept RaveExceptions.TransactionValidationError as e:\n    print(e.err[\"errMsg\"])\n    print(e.err[\"flwRef\"])\n```\n\nA sample ``` e.err ``` contains:\n\n```py\n{'error': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530899869968', 'flwRef': 'ACHG-1530899873118', 'errMsg': 'Pending OTP validation'}\n```\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n### ```.verify(txRef)```\n\nYou can call this to check if your transaction was completed successfully. You have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of charging.
