    "description": "magicsound\n=========\n*Cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.*\n\nInstallation\n------------\nInstall via pip:\n\n    $ pip install magicsound\n\nDone.\n\nIf you want to just work from the source,\njust copy the magicsound.py file into the same folder as your project,\nor into a library path.\n\nThe latest version of the source code can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/jhanish/magicsound\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\nOnce you've installed, you can really quickly verify that it works with just this:\n\n    >>> from magicsound import magicsound\n    >>> magicsound('/path/to/a/sound/file/you/want/to/play.wav') \n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe magicsound module contains only one thing - the function (also named) magicsound.\n\nIt requires one argument - the path to the file with the sound you'd like to play. This may be a local file, or a URL.\n\nThere's an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously when possible, which is not always at this point.\n\nOn Windows, uses windll.winmm. WAVE and MP3 have been tested and are known to work. Other file formats may work as well.\n\nOn MacOS, we use the command line utility afplay so nothing else needs to be installed.\n\nOn Raspberry Pi, we use ffplay command line utility for the same reason.\n\nOn Linux, uses GStreamer. Known to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and ElementaryOS\nLoki. Support for the ``block`` argument is currently not implemented.\n\nRequirements\n------------\nTested on Windows 10, MacOS 10.15.6 (Catalina), and Raspian on a 4 gig PI 4.\nI've only tested with Python 3.8 on all 3 platforms.\nThe code is all simple enough that it's application should be able with a broad set\nof software versions, but let me know, I'd like to fix any found problems\non modern systems, and add others as possible.  \nIf you need older systems to work, please check out\nthe playsound project that this project was forked from.\n\nhttps://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound\n\nCopyright\n---------\nThis software is Copyright (c) 2020 Joe Hanish <joe.hanish@gmail.com>.\n\nThis is a derivitive work from Taylor Marks playsound library that you can find\nhere: https://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound. \n\nIf you are using Python older than 3.6, I recommend you use his library.  Magicsound was made just to fix some problems on newer systems, eradicate the install requirement for OSX, and detect and work with Raspberry Pi directly.  This project is MIT licensed as is his. \n\nTaylor's original source copyright:\nThis software is Copyright (c) 2016 Taylor Marks <taylor@marksfam.com>.\n\nSee the bundled LICENSE file for more information.\n\n\n",
