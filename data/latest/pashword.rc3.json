    "description": "# Pashword\n\n> What does it mean?\n\nThe name \"Pashword\" comes from the contraction of \"hash\" and \"password\".\n\n> What is it for?\n\nPashword is a Python package for password management.\n\n> Is it hard to use?\n\nSimply create a configuration file and execute one of the available commands.\n\n## Background\n\nPassword management is a subject that we often prefer to ignore.\nAnd for good reason, it's usually a headache.\nDo you have to write everything down in a notebook that you risk losing or having stolen?\nShould everything be stored in plain text?\nOr encrypt it?\nHow to keep it all easy to use and portable from one machine to another?\nThe goal here is to settle all these issues once and for all by proposing, in open source, a very simple system based on a light and innovative mechanism.\n\n## Features\n\nWith this Python package, your passwords become virtual.\nThey are not stored, neither in clear, nor in encrypted form.\nThey are generated from a configuration file, exist only in RAM for the period you want to view them, then disappear.\nTo make it work you only have to remember one secret key.\nThe main features offered by Pashword are identified by the following commands:\n\n* `read`: To temporarily display the passwords generated from a configuration file.\n* `sort`: To sort in alphabetical order the accounts contained in your configuration file.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Virtual environment\n\nIt is generally advisable to install Python packages in [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\nThis is not necessary, but it will allow you to isolate the package and its dependencies from the rest of your computer.\n\n### PyPi\n\nPashword is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pashword).\nThe easiest way to install it is to run the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install pashword\n```\n\n### Development mode\n\nIf you want to work on the package source files, you can install the package in [development mode](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode).\nTo do this on a POSIX system, clone, or download the project from its [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/dustils/pashword) and execute the following command in it:\n\n```bash\nsource setup.sh\n```\n\n### Android\n\nTo synchronize your passwords on your Android phone, follow these steps:\n\n* Install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) on your phone.\n* Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux) (from F-Droid app).\n* In the Termux app, execute the following commands:\n\n```bash\npkg update\npkg install git\npkg install openssh\npkg install python3\ntermux-setup-storage\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"gitlab\"\nless ~/.ssh/rsa.pub\n```\n\n* Copy the public key.\n* Add the public key in your account settings on GitLab.\n* Create a GitLab project containing your configuration file (see below).\n* Clone the project on your phone.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Password configuration file\n\nTo start, you need to create a file that will contain the (public) information that will allow you to reconstruct your passwords.\nThis file contains several sections.\nEach of these sections corresponds to the information needed to generate a single password.\nSo you can have more than one account saved in the same configuration file.\nHere is an example of a file named `your-name.conf`:\n\n```ini\n[entity-one.org]\nmail = user@email.address\ndate = 2023-07-19\nform = u***-l***-d***\n\n[entity-two.com]\nuser = username\ndate = 2022-02-19\nform = u***-l***-d***\n```\n\nThe name of the section must be different for each account.\nIt is recommended to name the sections with the hostname of the server on which your account is registered.\nThe only mandatory entry is the one called `form`.\nThis entry defines the format of the generated password.\nTo see what the metacharacters correspond to, look at the section `pashword.core.sets` of the package configuration file [default.conf](/src/pashword/default.conf).\nEven if it is not mandatory, it is advisable to keep the sections `mail` (or `user`) and `date`.\nThis will allow you to remember your login name and the date you last changed your password.\n\n### Hashing and modus operandi\n\nPasswords are generated by a hashing algorithm from a secret key known only by the user to which is concatenated a cryptographic salt made up of the unencrypted information contained in the configuration file.\nTo clarify, the secret key and the configuration file are the inputs to the program, and the passwords for your accounts are the outputs.\nHere are a few notions specific to the use of Pashword:\n\n* Only one secret key is used to reveal the passwords of the accounts defined in a configuration file.\n* You do not choose the value of your passwords. You only choose their format (according to what is allowed on this or that site).\n* Changing an entry in a section of the configuration file will change the password associated with the section.\n* Since a password is an hash of your secret key (to which we add a salt specific to the account), it is technically impossible (or at least extremely complicated) to deduce your secret key from a leaked password.\n* Since a unique salt (consisting of the section name and its entries) is used for each account, the passwords generated from the different sections will all be different.\n\nTo create a password you must:\n\n1. Add the section corresponding to the new account in the configuration file.\n2. Run the program to discover the value of your password.\n\nTo change a password you must:\n\n1. Run the program to get the value of your old password.\n2. Add the section corresponding to the account in the configuration file.\n3. Run again the program to get the new value of your password.\n\n### Display help\n\nRun the following commands to display information about the accepted arguments in each of the program features.\n\n```bash\npashword read --help\npashword sort --help\n```\n\n### Read a password book\n\nTo display your passwords, run the following command:\n\n```bash\npashword read your-name.conf\n```\n\nIn order to limit the number of sections to be displayed, the program will first ask you for a matching pattern.\nAs for matching filenames on Linux, use the `*` character as a wildcard.\nThen the program will ask you to enter your secret key before displaying your passwords.\nAs it is, the program has no way of knowing if you have entered the right secret key or not.\nIt will generate the passwords, but they will be wrong if there is a typo in the secret key.\n\nIf you want to be notified when you mistype your secret key, use option `--hash`, followed by the path to the file in which a hash value of your secret key will be stored.\nIf the file does not exist, it will be generated with the value of the secret key that you will enter to decode your passwords.\nWhen the file already exists, it is used to compare the secret key you enter with the one you entered the first time.\nIf you want to change your secret key, simply delete the file containing the hash.\n\nIf other people can see your screen, you may not want your passwords to be visible.\nFor this, use the `--hide` option.\nThis will allow you to copy your passwords without them being displayed.\n\n### Sort a password book\n\nYou can sort the sections contained in a configuration file alphabetically with the following command.\n\n```bash\npashword sort your-name.conf\n```\n\n### Configure the package\n\nTo modify the package configuration at the time of execution of a command, you can use the `--config` option, followed by the path to a custom configuration file.\nYou can create your own custom configuration file by copying the default configuration file [`default.conf`](/src/pashword/default.conf).\n\n## Credits\n\n* Dunstan Becht\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
