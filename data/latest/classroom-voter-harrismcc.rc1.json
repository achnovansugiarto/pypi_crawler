    "description": "# Classroom Voter\nClassroom Voter is a secure LAN based polling system, similar to iClicker, which allows teachers to administer live polls. To start a poll, the teacher simply has to run the host program on their local machine. To join, students run the client program and enter the teachers IP address. Students can respond to questions via clients on their machines. \n\nTraffic is sent over HTTP on the local network. The system provides instructors with the ability to take polls while providing controllable levels of anonymity for students. For example, a teacher might make one question anonymized so that their view of the poll results just shows the number of students who voted for each option. Another poll might be transparent, and the instructor can see which participant voted for which option.\n\n# Installation\n\n## Automatic\nThis package is distributed via TestPyPI (Test, since the project is still in beta). The [latest version](https://test.pypi.org/project/classroom-voter-harrismcc/) can be installed via pip:\n```\npip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple classroom-voter-harrismcc\n```\n## Manual\n### Linux/OSX\nFrom the [latest release](https://github.com/harrismcc/classroom-voter/releases/), download the file that looks like `classroom_voter_harrismcc-VERSION.tar.gz`. Next, use pip to install with the following command (making sure that the directory with the .tar.gz file is the active directoy):\n```\npip install classroom_voter_harrismcc-VERSION.tar.gz`\n```\n### Windows\nFrom the [latest release](https://github.com/harrismcc/classroom-voter/releases/), download the file that looks like `classroom_voter_harrismcc-VERSION.whl`. Next, use pip to install with the following command (making sure that the directory with the .tar.gz file is the active directoy):\n```\npip install classroom_voter_harrismcc-VERSION.whl`\n```\nor\n```\npython -m pip install classroom_voter_harrismcc-VERSION.whl\n```\n\n\n# Usage\n\nAfter classroom voter is install, it can be run via the command line. To login as a student or professor, run \n```\npython -m classroom_voter.login\n```\nThis will prompt you first for the ip address and port of the server (given to you by the professor/ system admin), and then for your username and password (check your email)\n\n",
