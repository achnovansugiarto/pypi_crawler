    "description": "\n# CMTUTILS\n\n### 28th October 2014 Neil D. Lawrence\n\nAs well as pandas and the standard numpy/scipy stack, the library has the following dependencies: `lxml`, `openpyxl`, `gdata`, `pods`\n\n```\npip install lxml\npip install openpyxl\npip install gdata\npip install pods\n```\n\n\nIn 2014 [Corinna Cortes](http://research.google.com/pubs/author121.html) and I\nwere NIPS program Co-Chairs. Alan Saul was our Program Manager. As part of the\nprocess we wrote a lot of scripts for processing the data. The scripts I wrote\nused the `IPython notebook` (now [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)) and\n`pandas`. It was always my intention to summarise this work in case others find\nit useful. It is also quite a good document for summarising what is involved in\nprogram chairing a major conference like NIPS.\n\nIn May 2021, I separated out the utility files used for the notebooks into a separate python module. The library, `cmtutils`, which manages the submissions.  For\nreviewer management (which was the first thing written) the scripts are based\naround a local mirror of the CMT user data base in SQLite. For review management\nwe moved things much more towards `pandas` and used CMT as the central\nrepository of reviews, exporting them on a daily basis.\n\nA lot of communication was required between CMT through imports and exports. Some\nof the links used for CMT exports are available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sods/conference/blob/master/Useful%20Links.ipynb).\nThe various tasks are structured in IPython notebooks in the conference repo. The code used was\nfirst written for the NIPS 2014 conference, but ideas were based on experience\nfrom using CMT for AISTATS 2012 and some preliminary code written then (for\nexample for importing the XML formatted version of Excel that CMT uses).\n\nRight from the start it was felt that being able to import and export\ninformation to Google spreadsheets would be very useful. With this in mind an\ninterface between `pandas` and Google sheets was created (initially just for\nreading, then later for updating). This made it much easier to import reviewer\nsuggestions and export information about paper statuses to reviewers. That\nsoftware has been spun out as part of a suite of tools for [Open Data\nScience](http://inverseprobability.com/2014/07/01/open-data-science/) that is\n[available on github here](https://github.com/sods/ods). These notebooks are\nalso available in their own [github repository for conference\nsoftware](https://github.com/lawrennd/neurips2014).\n\nA note on the code. A lot of this code was written 'live' as reviews were coming\nin or as a crisis required averting. The original code for sharing information\nvia Google spreadsheets was written across two or three days whilst on a family\nholiday in the Catskills. Much of the code could do with rewriting, and this is\nan ongoing process that I hope other conference chairs or program managers will\ncontribute to. It is shared here as a record of the work required for a\nconference like NIPS as well as in the hope that it will be useful for others.\nIt is not shared as an example of 'best practice' in python coding. There are\nsome parts I'm proud of and others I'm not. However, I think it *is* a very good\nexample of how the notebook can be used with python and `pandas`to do 'live'\ndata processing of some importance whilst under a great deal of pressure. I\ncan't imagine having done it quite like this with a different suite of tools.\n\nAs well as the installed files, you need to create a file called `.cmt_user.cfg` in your home directory and give it the following fields:\n\n```\n# This is a user's personal configuration file for CMT\n[conference]\nshort_name = NIPS\nyear = 2014\nchair_email = program-chairs@nips.cc\n\n[cmt]\nexport_directory = \n\n[gmail]\naccount = \nname = \npassword = \n\n[google docs]\n# Here include the spreadsheet keys of program committee and reviewer candiates\nprogram_committee_key = \nreviewer_candidate_key =  \nbuddy_pair_key = \nglobal_results_key = \n\n[review data]\ndirectory = \nfile = all_reviews.pickle\n```\n\n\n",
