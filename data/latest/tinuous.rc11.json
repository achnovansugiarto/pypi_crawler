Just use `pip\n<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install\n``tinuous`` and its dependencies::\n\n    python3 -m pip install tinuous\n\n``tinuous`` can also optionally integrate with DataLad_.  To install DataLad\nalongside ``tinuous``, specify the ``datalad`` extra::\n\n    python3 -m pip install \"tinuous[datalad]\"\n\n``tinuous`` is also available for conda!  To install, run::\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge tinuous\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n::\n\n    tinuous [<global options>] <command> [<args> ...]\n\n\nGlobal Options\n--------------\n\n-c FILE, --config FILE          Read configuration from the given file [default\n                                value: ``tinuous.yaml``]\n\n-E FILE, --env FILE             Load environment variables from the given\n                                ``.env`` file.

Each key is the name\n    of a custom placeholder, without enclosing braces, and the value is the\n    string to substitute in its place.  Custom values may contain standard path\n    template placeholders as well as other custom placeholders.\n\n``ci``\n    *(required)* A mapping from the names of the CI systems from which to\n    retrieve assets to sub-mappings containing CI-specific configuration.\n    Including a given CI system is optional; assets will only be fetched from a\n    given system if it is listed in this mapping.\n\n    The CI systems and their sub-mappings are as follows:\n\n    ``github``\n        Configuration for retrieving assets from GitHub Actions.  Subfields:\n\n        ``paths``\n            A mapping giving `template strings <Path Templates_>`_ for the\n            paths at which to save various types of assets.  If this is empty\n            or not present, no assets are retrieved.  Subfields:\n\n            ``logs``\n                A template string that will be instantiated for each workflow\n                run to produce the path for the directory (relative to the\n                current working directory) under which the run's build logs\n                will be saved.  If this is not specified, no logs will be\n                downloaded.\n\n            ``artifacts``\n                A template string that will be instantiated for each workflow\n                run to produce the path for the directory (relative to the\n                current working directory) under which the run's artifacts will\n                be saved.  If this is not specified, no artifacts will be\n                downloaded.\n\n            ``releases``\n                A template string that will be instantiated for each\n                (non-draft, non-prerelease) GitHub release to produce the path\n                for the directory (relative to the current working directory)\n                under which the release's assets will be saved.  If this is not\n                specified, no release assets will be downloaded.\n\n        ``workflows``\n            A specification of the workflows for which to retrieve assets.\n            This can be either a list of workflow basenames, including the file\n            extension (e.g., ``test.yml``, not ``.github/workflows/test.yml``)\n            or a mapping containing the following fields:\n\n            ``include``\n                A list of workflows to retrieve assets for, given as either\n                basenames or (when ``regex`` is true) `Python regular\n                expressions`_ to match against basenames.  If ``include`` is\n                omitted, it defaults to including all workflows.\n\n            ``exclude``\n                A list of workflows to not retrieve assets for, given as either\n                basenames or (when ``regex`` is true) `Python regular\n                expressions`_ to match against basenames.  If ``exclude`` is\n                omitted, no workflows are excluded.  Workflows that match both\n                ``include`` and ``exclude`` are excluded.\n\n            ``regex``\n                A boolean.  If true (default false), the elements of the\n                ``include`` and ``exclude`` fields are treated as `Python\n                regular expressions`_ that are matched (unanchored) against\n                workflow basenames; if false, they are used as exact names\n\n            When ``workflows`` is not specified, assets are retrieved for all\n            workflows in the repository.\n\n    ``travis``\n        Configuration for retrieving logs from Travis-CI.com.  Subfield:\n\n        ``paths``\n            A mapping giving `template strings <Path Templates_>`_ for the\n            paths at which to save various types of assets.  If this is empty\n            or not present, no assets are retrieved.  Subfield:\n\n            ``logs``\n                A template string that will be instantiated for each job of\n                each build to produce the path for the file (relative to the\n                current working directory) in which the job's logs will be\n                saved.  If this is not specified, no logs will be downloaded.\n\n    ``appveyor``\n        Configuration for retrieving logs from Appveyor.  Subfields:\n\n        ``paths``\n            A mapping giving `template strings <Path Templates_>`_ for the\n            paths at which to save various types of assets.  If this is empty\n            or not present, no assets are retrieved.  Subfield:\n\n            ``logs``\n                A template string that will be instantiated for each job of\n                each build to produce the path for the file (relative to the\n                current working directory) in which the job's logs will be\n                saved.  If this is not specified, no logs will be downloaded.\n\n        ``accountName``\n            *(required)* The name of the Appveyor account to which the\n            repository belongs on Appveyor\n\n        ``projectSlug``\n            The project slug for the repository on Appveyor; if not specified,\n            it is assumed that the slug is the same as the repository name\n\n``since``\n    A timestamp (date, time, & timezone); only assets for builds started after\n    the given point in time will be retrieved.  If not specified, the cutoff\n    set by ``max-days-back`` will be used.\n\n    As the script retrieves new build assets, it keeps track of their starting\n    points.  Once the assets for all builds for the given CI system &\n    configuration have been fetched up to a certain point, the timestamp for\n    the latest such build is stored in the state file and used as the new\n    ``since`` value for the respective CI system on subsequent runs.  If the\n    ``since`` setting in the configuration file is then updated to a newer\n    timestamp, the configuration will override the value in the state file, and\n    the next ``tinuous`` run will only retrieve assets after the new setting.\n\n``max-days-back``\n    An integer specifying the maximum number of days back to look for builds;\n    defaults to 30.\n\n    If ``since`` is earlier than the date indicated by this value, and if the\n    timestamp for a given CI system saved in the state file is either missing\n    (i.e., if this is the first run of ``tinuous`` against the CI system) or\n    older than ``since``, then ``tinuous`` will use the explicitly-specified\n    ``since`` value as the cutoff and ignore ``max-days-back``.\n\n``until``\n    A timestamp (date, time, & timezone); only assets for builds started before\n    the given point in time will be retrieved\n\n``types``\n    A list of build trigger event types; only assets for builds triggered by\n    one of the given events will be retrieved.  If this is not specified,\n    assets will be retrieved for all recognized event types.\n\n    The recognized event types are:\n\n    ``cron``\n        A build run on a schedule\n\n    ``manual``\n        A build triggered manually by a human or through the CI system's API\n\n    ``pr``\n        A build in response to activity on a pull request\n\n    ``push``\n        A build in response to new commits\n\n``secrets``\n    A mapping from names (used in log messages) to `Python regular\n    expressions`_ matching secrets to sanitize\n\n``allow-secrets-regex``\n    Any strings that match a ``secrets`` regex and also match this regex will\n    not be sanitized.  Note that ``allow-secrets-regex`` is tested against just\n    the substring that matched a ``secrets`` regex without any surrounding\n    text, and so lookahead and lookbehind will not work in this regex.\n\n``datalad``\n    A sub-mapping describing integration of ``tinuous`` with DataLad_.\n    Subfields:\n\n    ``enabled``\n        A boolean.  If true (default false), DataLad must be installed, the\n        current directory will be converted into a DataLad dataset if it is not\n        one already, the assets will optionally be divided up into subdatasets,\n        and all new assets will be committed at the end of a run of ``tinuous\n        fetch``.  ``path`` template strings may contain ``//`` separators\n        indicating the boundaries of subdatasets.\n\n    ``cfg_proc``\n        Procedure to run on the dataset & subdatasets when creating them\n\n    .. _DataLad: https://www.datalad.org\n\n.. _Python regular expressions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html\n                                #regular-expression-syntax\n\nA sample config file:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    repo: datalad/datalad\n    vars:\n      path_prefix: '{year}//{month}//{day}/{ci}/{type}'\n      build_prefix: '{path_prefix}/{type_id}/{build_commit[:7]}'\n    ci:\n      github:\n        paths:\n          logs: '{build_prefix}/{wf_name}/{number}/logs/'\n          artifacts: '{build_prefix}/{wf_name}/{number}/artifacts/'\n          releases: '{path_prefix}/{release_tag}/'\n        workflows:\n          - test_crippled.yml\n          - test_extensions.yml\n          - test_macos.yml\n      travis:\n        paths:\n          logs: '{build_prefix}/{number}/{job}.txt'\n      appveyor:\n        paths:\n          logs: '{build_prefix}/{number}/{job}.txt'\n        accountName: mih\n        projectSlug: datalad\n    since: 2021-01-20T00:00:00Z\n    max-days-back: 14\n    types: [cron, manual, pr, push]\n    secrets:\n      github: '\\bgh[a-z]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36,}\\b'\n      docker-hub: '\\b[a-f0-9]{8}(?:-[a-f0-9]{4}){3}-[a-f0-9]{12}\\b'\n      appveyor: '\\b(v2\\.)?[a-z0-9]{20}\\b'\n      travis: '\\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{22}\\b'\n      aws: '\\b[a-zA-Z0-9+/]{40}\\b'\n    datalad:\n      enabled: true\n      cfg_proc: text2git\n\n\nPath Templates\n--------------\n\nThe path at which assets for a given workflow run, build job, or release are\nsaved is determined by instantiating the appropriate path template string given\nin the configuration file for the corresponding CI system.

For other builds\n                        (along with PR builds on GitHub Actions), this is\n                        always the same as ``{build_commit}``.\n``{number}``            The run number of the workflow run (GitHub) or the\n                        build number (Travis and Appveyor) [2]_\n``{status}``            The success status of the workflow run (GitHub) or job\n                        (Travis and Appveyor); the exact strings used depend on\n                        the CI system [2]_\n``{common_status}``     The success status of the workflow run or job,\n                        normalized into one of ``success``, ``failed``,\n                        ``errored``, or ``incomplete`` [2]_\n``{wf_name}``           *(GitHub only)* The escaped [1]_ name of the workflow\n                        [2]_\n``{wf_file}``           *(GitHub only)* The basename of the workflow file\n                        (including the file extension) [2]_\n``{run_id}``            *(GitHub only)* The unique ID of the workflow run [2]_\n``{job}``               *(Travis and Appveyor only)* The number of the job,\n                        without the build number prefix (Travis) or the job ID\n                        string (Appveyor) [2]_\n``{job_index}``         *(Travis and Appveyor only)* The index of the job in\n                        the list returned by the API, starting from 1 [2]_\n``{job_env}``           *(Appveyor only)* The escaped [1]_ environment\n                        variables specific to the job [2]_\n``{job_env_hash}``      *(Appveyor only)* The SHA1 hash of ``{job_env}`` before\n                        escaping [2]_\n======================  =======================================================\n\n.. _datetime: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects\n.. _strftime(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html\n                #strftime-and-strptime-format-codes\n\n.. [1] Escaping consists of percent-encoding the characters ``\\/<>:|\"?*%`` and\n       replacing each whitespace character with a space.\n\n..

Create a new directory and ``cd`` into it.\n\n2. Create a file named ``tinuous.yaml`` in this directory `as described above\n   <Configuration_>`_\n\n3. Create a file named ``.env`` in this directory containing any needed\n   authentication tokens.  Entries are of the form ``NAME=value``, e.g.::\n\n        GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_abcdef0123456789\n        TRAVIS_TOKEN=asdfghjkl\n        APPVEYOR_TOKEN=v2.qwertyuiop\n\n4. Create a Python virtualenv_ to provide an isolated environment to install\n   ``tinuous`` into::\n\n        python3 -m venv venv\n\n5. Install ``tinuous`` inside the virtualenv::\n\n        venv/bin/pip install tinuous\n\n   If you want to use DataLad with ``tinuous``, you need to install it as well,\n   even if it's already installed outside the virtualenv::\n\n        venv/bin/pip install datalad\n\n6. Run ``tinuous`` to fetch your first logs and test your configuration::\n\n        venv/bin/tinuous fetch\n\n7. Once you're satisfied with your ``tinuous`` config, set up scheduled runs by\n   creating a cronjob of the form::\n\n        0 0 * * * cd /path/to/directory && chronic flock -n -E 0 .tinuous.lock venv/bin/tinuous fetch\n\n   This job runs once a day at midnight; adjust the cron expression to taste.\n   We use ``chronic`` (from moreutils_) to suppress output unless the command\n   fails, thus preventing e-mails full of log messages for every run.\n   ``flock`` is used to ensure that no more than one instance of ``tinuous`` is\n   running at a time.\n\n8. If you want to commit your logs to a Git repository, first make sure that\n   ``.env``, ``venv/``, and ``.tinuous.lock`` are included in the repository's\n   ``.gitignore``.  Consider setting up the repository with DataLad_; when the\n   DataLad integration is enabled, ``tinuous`` will automatically commit any\n   new logs at the end of a run.\n\n   If you're using a regular Git repository instead, you can commit any new\n   logs at the end of a run by adding the following script to your ``tinuous``\n   directory:\n\n   .. code:: bash\n\n       #!/bin/bash\n       set -ex\n       venv/bin/tinuous fetch\n       git add --all\n       if ! git diff --cached --quiet\n       then git commit -m \"Ran tinuous\"\n            # Uncomment if you want to push the commits to a remote repository:\n            #git push\n       fi\n\n   and changing your cronjob to::\n\n        0 0 * * * cd /path/to/directory && chronic flock -n -E 0 .tinuous.lock bash name-of-script.sh\n\n9. If you ever need to upgrade ``tinuous``, run the following command inside\n   your ``tinuous`` directory::\n\n        venv/bin/pip install --upgrade tinuous\n\n10. Enjoy your collection of logs, build artifacts, and/or release assets!\n\n.. _virtualenv: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and\n                -virtual-environments/\n\n.. _moreutils: https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/\n",
