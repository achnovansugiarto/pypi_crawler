Those\nannouncements can contain rich format and a user read log is kept for everyone.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo create new announcements a user should be in the *Announcements Managers* group.\nWhen your user has such permissions, this is the way to create an announcement:\n\n#. Go to *Discuss > Announcements*\n#. Create a new one and define a title. This title will be shown in the announcement\n   header.\n#. Define the announcement scope:\n\n   - Specific users: manually select which users will see the announcement.\n   - User groups: users from the selected groups will be the ones to see the\n     announcement.\n#. Define the announcement body. You can use rich formatting and event paste your\n   own html (editor in debug mode).\n#. By default, the announcement will be archived. This is to prevent the announcement\n   to show up before time.\n#. Once the announcement is ready, unarchive it going to the *Actions* menu an choosing\n   the *Unarchive* option.\n#. Optionally you can set an announcement date to schedule the announcement. The\n   announcement won't show up until that date.\n#. If the announcement doesn't make sense once a date is passed, you can set a due date.\n   From that date, the announcement won't be shown to anyone.\n\nThere's a soft compatibility with OCA's `web_dialog_size` module. If the instance has\nthe module installed, you'll have the dialog resize controls by default in the\nannouncements. Additionally, you can show the announcement dialogs expanded to the\nscreen full width by default setting the system parameter key `announcement.full_size`\nwith to any value. Remove the parameter record to disable this behavior.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nWhen a user in the scope of active announcements logs in, those will popup. The user\nhas to mark them as read to continue working. If the announcement is set during the\nuser session, the announcement will be eventually prompted in the top bar on the right\npart. The user click on the unread announcements icon (a speaker) and the announcements\nwill popup for the user to check them.\n\nUsers can go *Discuss > Announcements*  to check current and past announcements.\nAnnouncement managers can also track which users have read the announcement.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* It could be integrated in Discuss app to review past announcements.\n* Log other information like geolocation, IP, browser agent, etc when marking\n  announcement as read.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux/issues/new?body=module:%20announcement%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`__:\n\n  * Pedro M.
