    "description": "SecMet - A Python Library to Handle Secondary Metabolite Annotations\n====================================================================\n\n| This library is intended to make dealing with secondary metabolite\n  annotations\n| as provided by databases like\n  `MIBiG <http://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/>`__ or tools like\n| `antiSMASH <http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/>`__ easier from\n  within python programs.\n\n| At the moment, it just supports the GenBank file format used by\n  `MIBiG <http://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/>`__\n| and `antiSMASH <http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/>`__, not\n  the MIBiG JSON format. Support for this is\n| planned.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n| SecMet is a normal Python module, so you can install it from a local\n  repository\n| checkout using ``python setup.py install``, or from PyPi using\n  ``pip install secmet``.\n\nNote that secmet is still in early development, and not fit for\nproduction use.\n\nPackaging\n---------\n\n| Because I perfer to work with markdown and Python forces me to use\n| reStructuredText, a Makefile helps in order to create a new PyPi\n  release. The\n| ``pandoc`` utility is required. Run the Makefile using\n  ``make release`` to create a\n| new secmet library sdist.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n    Copyright 2015  Kai Blin <kblin@biosustain.dtu.dk>\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.",
