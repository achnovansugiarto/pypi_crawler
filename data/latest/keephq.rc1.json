Let's Go! ⏰\n\n<h5>First, clone Keep repository:</h5>\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep\n```\n\n<h5>Install Keep CLI</h5>\n\n```shell\npip install .\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\npoetry shell\npoetry install\n```\n\n<h5>From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:</h5>\n\n```\nkeep version\n```\n\nGet a Slack incoming webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use Keep to configure it:\n\n```\nkeep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo\n```\n\nPaste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. <https://hooks.slack.com/services/...>) and you're good to go 👌\n\n<h5>Let's now execute our example \"Paper DB has insufficient disk space\" alert</h5>\n\n```bash\nkeep run --alerts-file examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml\n```\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    Voilà 🥳\n    <br />\n    <img src=\"/docs/static/img/alert-example.png\">\n    <br />\n    You should have received your first \"Dunder Mifflin Paper Company\" alert in Slack by now.\n    <br />\n</div>\n\n\n### Docker\n\nConfigure the Slack provider (See \"[Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing)\" on how to obtain the webhook URL)\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo\n```\n\nYou should now have a providers.yaml file created locally\n\nRun Keep and execute our example \"Paper DB has insufficient disk space\" alert\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml\n```\n\n### Render\nClick the Deploy to Render button to deploy Keep as a background worker running in [Render](https://www.render.com)\n\n[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)\n\nTo run Keep and execute our example \"Paper DB has insufficient disk space\" alert, you will need to configure you Slack provider.\n<br />\nWhen clicking the Deploy to Render button, you will be asked to provide the `KEEP_PROVIDER_SLACK_DEMO` environment variable, this is the expected format:\n\n```json\n{\"authentication\": {\"webhook_url\": \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/...\"}}\n```\n\n\\* Refer to [Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing) on how to obtain the webhook URL\n\n##### Wanna have your alerts up and running in production?
