Installing this package and it's included scripts\n\n```\n    python -m pip install tpds-certificate-tools\n```\n\n2. Extract the CSRs zip file provided by Microchip Provisioning Services. Use this path as --in-path\n\n3. Create a folder to store the generated signer certificates. Use this path as --out-path\n\n4. Provide the signer CA key to sign the CSRs as --cakey.\n\n5. Use the signer.crt available in this package as --cacert.\n\n    Following is the example command for reference\n    ```\n        python sign_csr.py --in-path test_csrs --out-path test_csrs_out --cakey signer_ca.key --cacert signer.crt\n    ```\n\n6. This should generate signers signed by signer_ca in --out-path folder. Zip this folder and share to Microchip Provisioning Services along with Provisioning package generated on TPDS Configurator.\n",
