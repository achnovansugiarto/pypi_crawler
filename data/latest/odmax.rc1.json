    "description": "ODMax\n=====\n\n**ODMax** is a utility to extract still frames from 360-degree video platforms such as GoPro or Insta. **ODMax** preserves the geoghraphical information\nin videos and adds the geolocation to stills so that they can be used for geospatial applications such as geospatial photogrammetry with OpenDroneMap, or Streetview applications.\n\nWe are seeking funding for the following frequently requested functionalities:\n* seamless processing via command-line to WebODM instances\n* seamless processing to streetview products\n* filtering options such as cloud masking, vegetation segmentation or other features\n* variable frame interval detection, based on feature changes (currently a fixed frame interval must be set) \n\nIf you wish to fund this or other work on features, please contact us at info@rainbowsensing.com.\n\n> **_note:_**  For instructions how to get Anaconda (with lots of pre-installed libraries) or Miniconda (light weight) installed, please go to https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/\n\n> **_manual:_** A full manual with examples can be found on https://odmax.readthedocs.io/\n\n> **_compatibility:_** At this moment **ODMax** works with GoPro videos. It may or may not work with other 360 degree camera brands and models but this has not been tested.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo get started with **ODMax**, we recommend to setup a python virtual environment. \nWe recommend using a Miniconda or Anaconda environment as this will ease installation, and will allow you to use all\nfunctionalities without any trouble. Especially geographical plotting with `cartopy` can be difficult to get installed. \nWith a `conda` environment this is solved. We have also conveniently packaged all dependencies for you. \nIn the subsections below, you can find specific instructions. \n\n### Installation for direct use\n\nIf you simply want to add **ODMax** to an existing python installation or virtual environment, then follow these \ninstructions.\n\nFirst activate the environment you want **ODMax** to be installed in (if you don't care about virtual environments, then \nsimply skip this step)\n\nThen install **ODMax** as follows:\n```\npip install odmax\n```\nThat's it! You are good to go!\n\n### Installation from code base\n\nTo install **ODMax** from scratch in a new virtual environment from the code base, go through these steps. Logical cases\nwhen you wish to install from the code base are:\n* You wish to have the very latest non-released version\n* You wish to develop on the code\n* You want to use our pre-packaged conda environment with all dependencies to setup a good virtual environment\n\nFirst, clone the code with `git` and move into the cloned folder.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/localdevices/ODMax.git\ncd ODMax\n```\n\nIf you want, setup a virtual environment as follows:\n```\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\nNow install the **ODMax** package. If you want to develop **ODMax** please type\n```\npip install -e .\n```\nIf you just want to use the lates **ODMax** code base (without the option to develop on the code) type:\n```\npip install .\n```\nThat's it, you are good to go.\n\n### Installation of exiftool for metadata extraction\n\nEspecially for photogrammetry or 360 streetview applications, it is essential to have time stamps and geographical\ncoordinates embedded in the extracted stills. ODMax automatically extracts such information from 360-video files if\nthese are recorded by the device used. In order to do this, ODMax requires ``exiftool`` to be installed and available on\nthe path. To install ``exiftool`` in Windows, please follow the download and installation instructions for Windows on\nhttps://exiftool.org/install.html. For Linux, you can also follow the download and installation instructions, or simply\nacquire a stable version from the package manager of your installed distribution. \n\nUsing ODMax\n-----------\nTo use **ODMax**, go to a command line and type \n```\nodmax --help\n```\nThis will provide an overview of the most up-to-date command line options.\nAlternatively, use our jupyter notebook examples to see common use cases on command-line as\nwell as directly in the API.\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\nThe development of ODMax has been supported by the Australian National University - Research School of Biology through \nfunding provided by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), Australian Plant Phenomics \nFacility (APPF), and the Australian Scalabel Drone Cloud (ASDC). \n\nLicense\n-------\n**ODMax** is licensed under AGPL Version 3 (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file).\n\n**ODMax** uses the following libraries and software with said licenses.\npy360convert is not being maintained actively, therefore the py360convert code has been integrated into the **ODMax**\ncode base.\n\n| Package                | Version      | License                                            |\n|------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| numpy                  | 1.21.4       | BSD License                                        |\n| opencv-python-headless | 4.5.4.60     | MIT License                                        |                                                                                      \n| gpxpy                  | 1.5.0        | Apache License, Version 2.0                        |                                                                      \n| tqdm                   | 4.62.3       | MIT License; Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)  |                                                \n| piexif                 | 1.1.3        | MIT License                                        |                                                                                      \n| matplotlib             | 3.5.1        | Python Software Foundation License                 |                                                               \n| geopandas              | 0.10.2       | BSD License                                        |                                                                                              \n | pandas                 | 1.3.5        | BSD License                                        |                                                                                      \n | Pillow                 | 8.4.0        | Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer (HPND) |                                               \n | py360convert           | 0.1.0        | MIT License                                        |      \n\nProject organisation\n--------------------\n\n    .\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── LICENSE\n    ├── setup.py            <- setup script compatible with pip\n    ├── environment.yml     <- YML-file for setting up a conda environment with dependencies\n    ├── docs                <- Sphinx documentation source code\n        ├── ...             <- Sphinx source code files\n    ├── examples            <- Small example files used in notebooks\n        ├── ...             <- individual .jpg and .mp4 files\n    ├── notebooks           <- Jupyter notebooks with examples how to use the API\n        ├── ...             <- individual Jupyter notebooks\n    ├── odmax               <- odmax library and CLI\n        ├── ...             <- odmax functions and CLI main function .py files\n\n\n\n\n\n",
