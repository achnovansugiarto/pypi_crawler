    "description": "Serdio\n===========\n\nAutomatic serialization of function inputs and outputs using MessagePack.\n\n## Why Serdio?\nRemotely executing Python code is complicated. A common pattern is to wrap the code into a function that maps serialized data to serialized data, however this leads to heavy amounts of boilerplate related to serialization of native and custom Python types.\n\nSerdio makes this easy by handling this serialization boilerplate for you as much as possible. For any custom types, it only requires the user to provide a encoder/decoder helpers that break the types down into Python-native components. An example can be found <a href=\"#using-serdio-with-custom-types\">below</a>.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\npip install serdio\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic\nHere, we use Serdio to lift a function that performs some simple math on native Python numbers.\n```python\n@serdio.lift_io\ndef my_cool_function(x: int, y: float, b: float = 1.0) -> float:\n    z = x * y\n    z += b\n    return z\n\nbytes_handler: Callable[bytes, bytes] = my_cool_function.as_bytes_handler()\n\nz = my_cool_function(2, 3.0)\nassert z == 7.0\n```\n\nNow we can use the `bytes_handler` function on Serdio-encoded bytes:\n\n```python\nxyb_bytes = serdio.serialize(2, 3.0, b=2.0)\nzbytes = bytes_handler(xyb_bytes)\n\nz = serdio.deserialize(zbytes)\nassert z == 8.0\n```\n\n### Using Serdio with Custom Types\nIn this example, we reproduce the above example with custom types `MyCoolClass` and `MyCoolResult`, instead of native Python numbers.\nTo give Serdio a little guidance, we provide helper functions that can convert our custom types  into Python native values and back (`my_cool_encoder` and `my_cool_decoder`).\n\nThe resulting function can operate on our custom types, while Serdio automatically applies the encoder/decoder helpers to function inputs and outputs.\n\n```python\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass MyCoolResult:\n    cool_result: float\n\n    def shift(self, other: float) -> MyCoolResult:\n        return MyCoolResult(self.cool_result + other)\n\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass MyCoolClass:\n    cool_int: float\n    cool_float: int\n\n    def mul(self) -> MyCoolResult:\n        return MyCoolResult(self.cool_int * self.cool_float)\n\ndef my_cool_encoder(x):\n    if dataclasses.is_dataclass(x):\n        return {\n            \"__type__\": x.__class__.__name__,\n            \"fields\": dataclasses.asdict(x)\n        }\n    return x\n\ndef my_cool_decoder(obj):\n    if \"__type__\" in obj:\n        obj_type = obj[\"__type__\"]\n        if obj_type == \"MyCoolClass\":\n            return MyCoolClass(**obj[\"fields\"])\n        elif obj_type == \"MyCoolResult\":\n            return MyCoolResult(**obj[\"fields\"])\n    return obj\n\n@serdio.lift_io(encoder_hook=my_cool_encoder, decoder_hook=my_cool_decoder)\ndef my_cool_function(a: MyCoolClass, b: float = 1.0) -> MyCoolResult:\n    x: MyCoolResult = a.mul()\n    return x.shift(b)\n\nmy_handler = my_cool_function.as_bytes_handler()\n\na = MyCoolClass(2, 3.0)\nab_bytes = serdio.serialize(a, b=2.0, encoder=my_cool_function.encoder)\nc_bytes = my_handler(ab_bytes)\nc = serdio.deserialize(c_bytes, my_cool_function.decoder)\n\nassert c == my_cool_function(a, b=2.0)\nprint(c.cool_result)\n# 8.0\n```\n",
