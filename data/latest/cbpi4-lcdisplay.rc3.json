In this folder run the following commands\nsudo cbpi create cbpi4-LCDisplay\nsudo chown -R pi cbpi4-LCDisplay\nsudo pip3 install -e ./cbpi4-LCDisplay\ncbpi add cbpi4-LCDisplay\nsudo rm -r cbpi4-LCDisplay/\nsudo git clone https://github.com/JamFfm/cbpi4-LCDisplay\n```\nWhat does the Code? It installs a default plugin named cbpi4-LCDisplay. During installation several registrations are made. The folder cbpi4-LCDisplay is deleated and the new folder is generated by the clone process.\n\n\nIn the log when starting cbpi4 you hopefully will notice that LCDisplay started without errors.\nYour user has to have permissions to write in the filesystem. This is usually the case when you use user pi.\n\n\n#### Software installation version2 ####\n\nThere is another way to install like:\n```python\nsudo pip3 install https://github.com/JamFfm/cbpi4-LCDisplay/archive/main.zip\n```\n\nbut this one installs in \n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/cbpi4-LCDisplay/*\nThis is not handy if you need to have assess to the code.\nI do not recomend now. But this seems to be the desired folder to install via pip package.\nPlease do not mix the two possibilities to install.\n\n\n#### Software installation version3 ####\n\n**The installation via pip package is work in progress! Not tested**\nThis is the official installation type via PyPI like Manuel83 (the developer) intended.\n```python\nsudo pip3 install cbpi4-LCDisplay\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nAt least configure your i2c address in the settings menu. Have a look at this documentation.\n\n\nThere are different modes:\n\n**Default display**\n--------------\n\nIf no brewing process is running the LCD Display will show\n\n- CraftBeerPi-Version \n- Brewery-name\n- Current IP adress \n- Current date/time\n\n**Multidisplay mode**\n-----------------\n\n- The script will loop through your kettles and display the target and current temperature. \n- If heater is on, a beerglas symbol will appear in the first row on the right side (not flashing).\n- Use refresh parameter in settings to slow don or speed up the kettle changes.\n- When target-temperature is reached it displays the remaining time of the step (rest) too.\n- **If the step name got the string \"boil\" in its name the remaining time to the next hop addition \nwill be displayed.** Otherwise the display of a boil type step looks the same as all the other steps.\n  \n\n\n**Single mode**\n-----------\n\n- Only displays one kettle but reacts a little bit faster on temperature changes. \n- It displays the remaining time of the step (rest) when target temperature is reached.\n- A small beerglas is flashing on/off in the first row on the right side to indicate that the heater is on.\n- **If the step name got the string \"boil\" in its name the remaining time to the next hop addition \nwill be displayed.** Otherwise the display of a boil type step looks the same as all the other steps.\n\n\n**Sensor mode**\n-----------\n\n- Only displays the values and names of the sensortype.\n- E.g. a iSpindel sensor can display temperature, gravity, battery etc. These values with \ncorresponding sensorname is shown.\n- The sensortype to be displayed is changed in settings section.\n- If there is a missing sensor like from a future addon it can be added by typing in the code of function\n\"set_sensortype_for_sensor_mode\" in the init.py file. \n- there is only OneWire and CustomSensor functioning (even some more are selectable)\n- This is fixed in the future when ConfigType.SENSOR ist fixed by Manuel\n\n\n\n\n**Fermenter mode: not implemented**\n--------------\n- Pretty much the same as multidisplay for all fermenter.\n- Starts automatically if there is no Brewstep running and a active fermenterstep\n- Displays the brew-name, fermenter-name, target-temperature, current-temperature of each fermenter.\n- If the heater or cooler of the fermenter is on it will show a symbol.\nA beerglas detects heater is on, * means cooler in on.\n- The remaining time for each fermenter is shown like in weeks, days, hours. \n- Fermenter mode starts when a fermenter-step of any of the fermenter is starting and no brewing step is running(most likely)\n- if there is a iSpindel sensor the Gravity is displayed at the corresponding fermenter.\n\nParameter\n---------\n\nThere are several parameter to change in the **settings** menu:\n\n\n**LCD_Address:**    \nThis is the address of the LCD module. You can detect it by \nusing the following command in the commandbox of the Raspi:   \n- sudo i2cdetect -y 1 \nor \n- sudo i2cdetect -y 0.\n\nDefault is 0x27.\n\n\n**LCD_Charactermap:**     \nChanges value between A00 and A02. This is a character map build in by factory into the LCD. \nMost likely you get a LCD with A00 when you by it in China. A00 has got most of the European letters, and a lot \nof Asia letters. For germans the ÄÖÜß is missing in A00. In A02 there are more European letters incl. ÄÖÜß.\nTherefore, the addon distinguish between the charmaps. \nIn case A00 it substitutes ÄÜÖß with custom made symbols which represent these letters.\nIn case A02 the addon skips substitution. If you notice strange letters try to change this parameter.\nDefault is \"A00\".\n\n \n**LCD_Display_Mode:**     \nChanges between the 3 modes. Default is Multidisplay:\n- Multidisplay \n- Singledisplay\n- Sensordisplay\n\n\n**LCD_Display_Sensortype:**     \nChanges between sensortype (is like family of same sensors) which will be displayed in \nthe sensormode (sensordisplay). Default is OneWire sensors. If there is more than one sensor of same sensor \ntype the display toggles between the sensors\n\n\n**LCD_Refresh:**\t\t  \nIn Multidisplay and Sensor mode this is the time to wait until switching to next displayed kettle. \nDefault is 3 sec.\n \n\n**LCD_Singledisplay:** \t  \nHere you can change the kettle to be displayed in single mode.\n\n\n## Hints\n\n- This is running in python3\n- Changing a LCD_xxxx parameter in the parameters menu or any\nfile in LCDDisplay folder usually requires a reboot.\n- Whenever you need a reboot, have a look in the comments of the parameters.\n- Future: A new fermenter should have a target temperature and at least one step defined.\n- Future: Maybe it is necessary to restart craftbeerpi after adding a new fermenter. \n\n- If the LCD address (e.g. 0x27) is right, but you still can not see letters displayed:\n  - try to adjust contrast by the screw on the back of the LCD Hardware (I2C Module)\n  - be sure to provide the LCD hardware with the right amount of voltage (mostly 5V or 3.3V)\n  - use a strong power-supply. If you notice LCD fading, there is a lack of current.\n  - use proper connections. Soldering the wires is best for connection. Bad connection can also result in fading the LCD.\n\n\n## Known Problems\nThe LCD hardware does not like temperature below 0°C (32°F). \nIt becomes slow and can be damaged like brightness is no more homogenous throughout the hole LCD area.\nFermenters are not implemented as they are not implemented in CBPI4 until now (5-2021)\n\n\n## Questions  \nQuestions can be posed in the Craftbeerpi user group in Facebook or in the repository.\n\n## Fixed Issues\n- has to be done",
