If you want to be able to create a mass request from a donation, you should also install the module *donation_mass*.\n\nThis module has an impact on accounting:\n* a mass request in waiting or started state is considered as a stock from an accounting point of view.\n* when a mass is celebrated, i.e. when the mass is validated in Odoo, an account move is automatically generated to move the amount of the donation associed to the mass line from the stock account to the revenue account.\n\nThis module also allows to transfer masses to an external celebrant. When validating the mass transfer, a journal entry is created that moves the corresponding donation amount from the mass stock account to the payable account of the external celebrant.\n\nThis module has been developped by the Barroux Abbey which is a Catholic Abbey. It is specific to the management of christian masses.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n * create a partner for each celebrant with the option *Celebrant* set to *Internal*.\n * if you transfer masses to an external celebrant, create a corresponding partner with *Celebrant* set to *External*.\n * check the configuration of the Mass Request Types that have been automatically created by the module.\n * check the configuration of the Mass Products that have been automatically created by the module. The revenue account of the mass product is used when the mass journal is validated.\n * on the Invoicing configuration page, configure the stock account for the celebrated mass and the account journal that will be used for the accounting entries generated when a mass is validated.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn the menu Mass > Mass Requests, create new mass requests. On each mass request, you should select the donor, the donation date, the mass request type and the intention. If the donor asked for a special date for the mass, you should also set a *Celebration Requested Date* (otherwise, leave empty). If the donor wanted the mass to be celebrated by a particular celebrant, select the celebrant (otherwise, leave empty).\n\nThen, start the wizard *Generate Masses Journal* to generate the masses for a particular date. You can print a report that display the list of masses with the associated celebrant , donor and intention. When it is confirmed that the masses for that day have been celebrated, start the wizard *Validate Masses Journal* to validate the masses ; you won't be able to modify the masses any more.\n\nIf you want to transfer mass requests to an external celebrant with the associated donations, create a new mass requests transfer. When you validate the mass request transfer, it will generate the corresponding accounting entries ; with these accounting entries, you will be able to generate the payment of the corresponding donations to the external celebrant.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/vertical-abbey/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/vertical-abbey/issues/new?body=module:%20mass%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Barroux Abbey\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Brother Bernard <informatique - at - barroux.org>\n* Brother Irénée (Barroux Abbey)\n* Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-alexis-via| image:: https://github.com/alexis-via.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/alexis-via\n    :alt: alexis-via\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-alexis-via| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/vertical-abbey <https://github.com/OCA/vertical-abbey/tree/14.0/mass>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
