    "description": "===============================\nOpenStack Community App Catalog\n===============================\nApplication Catalog for OpenStack\n\nThe OpenStack Community App Catalog will help you make\napplications available on your OpenStack cloud by providing\na community driven catalog containing Glance images, Heat\ntemplates and Murano applications.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nBy providing a public location where OpenStack users can\npublish and consume artifacts to share and add additional\ncapabilities, all OpenStack clouds become more valuable. For\nexample vendors can publish Glance images for launching new\nVMs, Heat templates for creating new stacks, or Murano app\npackages for installing complete applications. When many\nOpenStack community members are publishing artifacts that\nusers can easily download and install into their clouds this\nwill multiply the value of their OpenStack cloud. Easy\naccess to images, templates and apps will solve the \"what\nnow\" question some user consider after successfully\ndeploying an OpenStack environment.\n\n* Free software: Apache 2.0 License.
