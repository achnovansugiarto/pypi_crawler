    "description": "ABOUT\n=====\n\nTito is a tool for managing RPM based projects using git for their source code\nrepository.\n\nTito offers the following features:\n\n - Tag new releases with incremented RPM version or release.\n - Auto-generate spec file changelog based on git history since last tag.\n - Create reliable tar.gz files with consistent checksums from any tag.\n - Build source and binary rpms off any tag.\n - Build source and binary \"test\" rpms off most recently committed code.\n - Build multiple source rpms with appropriate disttags for submission to the\n   Koji build system\n - Build rpms via the \"mock\" tool.\n - On a per-branch basis in git:\n   - Maintain concurrent version streams.\n   - Vary the way packages are built/tagged.\n - Report on any diffs or commits messages missing since last tag.\n - Define release targets to publish your packages to yum repositories, or\n   the Fedora build system.\n - Define custom builder/releaser implementations for your own project needs.\n - Build packages off an \"upstream\" git repository, where modifications in the\n   \"downstream\" git repository will be applied as a patch in the source rpm.\n - Manage all of the above for a git repository with many disjoint packages\n   within it.\n\nRELATED PROJECTS\n================\n\n* `mockchain` from the [mock project](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki)\n* `mock`'s built-in SCM support in `mock-scm`\n* Fedora's [Koji](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/) build engine and [fedpkg](https://fedorahosted.org/fedpkg/) tools\n* The [OpenSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).\n* See also [Fedora wiki page for layered build tools](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Layered_build_scripts_for_package_maintainers)\n\nINSTALL\n=======\n\nFrom Fedora:\n\n    dnf install tito\n\nFrom CentOS / RHEL:\n\n    # Enable EPEL https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F\n    yum install tito\n\nFrom [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tito/):\n\n    pip install tito\n\nFrom git's `master` branch:\n\n- First install Tito's dependencies for your architecture, i.e. `x86_64`:\n\n      sudo dnf install --setopt=install_weak_deps=False \\\n          $(dnf repoquery --arch x86_64,noarch --requires tito --resolve -q)\n\n  _NOTE: This will install Tito's dependencies from Tito's latest release for\n  your system. If the `master` branch requires a new dependency, it will need to\n  be installed manually._\n\n- Then install Tito via so-called [User install](\n  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) (i.e. isolated to the\n  current user):\n\n      pip install --user https://github.com/rpm-software-management/tito/archive/master.tar.gz\n\nTo make an rpm of tito to install elsewhere\n\n    sudo yum install python-devel asciidoc\n    tito build --rpm\n    # see what's in the package\n    rpm -ql -p /tmp/tito/noarch/tito-*.noarch.rpm\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n===============\n\n\nFrom your git repository:\n\n    tito init\n\nThis will create a top-level metadata directory called \".tito/\" and commit it\nto git. This directory will store tito's configuration and package metadata on\na per branch basis. It will be filtered out when creating .tar.gz files.\n\n\nTAGGING PACKAGES\n================\n\nBefore doing most everything you'll need to tag your package(s).\n\nBefore doing this you'll need to ensure that your package spec files are at the top of the relative source tree for that package.\n\nFor the most common case, a single project git repository has the spec file and\nroot of the project at the top level of the git repository:\n\n    docs/\n    mypackage.spec\n    README\n    .tito/\n    src/\n    test/\n\nFor a multi-project git repository, packages can be defined in various\nsub-directories, provided they do not nest (i.e. walking up the tree, two spec\nfiles will never be encountered):\n\n    .tito/\n    package1/\n        docs/\n        mypackage.spec\n        README\n        src/\n        test/\n    subdir/\n        package2/\n            anotherpkg.spec\n            docs/\n            README\n            src/\n            test/\n\nThe packages can be organized in any hierarchy you like and even be moved\naround and re-tagged, we only need to have the spec file in the top level\ndirectory for that package.\n\nTagging packages is normally done with:\n\n    tito tag\n\nThis will:\n\n - bump the version or release in the spec file (use --keep-version to use whatever is defined in the spec file)\n - auto-generate a changelog from first line of each commit since last tag (use --no-auto-changelog if you do not want this)\n - open an editor allowing you a chance to edit that changelog\n - insert the changelog into your spec\n - commit these changes, and generate a git tag\n\nBy default if you omit --keep-version, tito will tag by bumping the rpm\nversion. (i.e. we bump the Z in X.Y.Z. If you'd prefer to bump the package\nrelease instead (normally should just be used for changes to the spec file or\npatches applied within it), you can change the 'tagger' class in\n.tito/tito.props to ReleaseTagger. This will affect all packages in this git\nbranch, if you'd prefer to do this on a per-package basis you can do so in a\npackage specific tito.props. (see section below)\n\nOnce a package is tagged you will need to push both the auto-commit and the tag\nto your remote git repository before tito will let you build it. (better\nsupport for standalone git repositories is coming, for now --offline will help)\n\nSee \"man tito\" for more options.\n\nBUILDING PACKAGES\n=================\n\nTo build the most recent .tar.gz for a package, cd into that packages directory\nand run:\n\n    tito build --tgz\n\nNote that this tarball will have a consistent checksum every time.\n\nLikewise the --srpm and --rpm options allow you to build both binary and source\nrpms.\n\nAdd in the --tag=TAG option to build any of the above for any past tag.\n\nIf you're working on something locally and would like to check that your\npackage is still building ok without pushing your changes to the remote\nrepository, add the --test option. This will build a test rpm from your most\nrecently committed work. (NOTE: does *not* include uncommitted changes)\n\nTODO: Document the use of --release, which is complicated and untested against\nFedora's Koji.\n\nSee \"man tito\" for more options.\n\n\nRELEASING PACKAGES\n==================\n\nTito supports a mechanism where you can define multiple release targets.\n\nIn .tito/releasers.conf, create a section like:\n\n    [yum-f15-x86_64]\n    releaser = tito.release.YumRepoReleaser\n    builder = tito.builder.MockBuilder\n    builder.mock = fedora-15-x86_64\n    rsync = fedorapeople.org:/srv/repos/dgoodwin/tito/fedora-15/x86_64/\n\nYou can define as many release targets as you like with various configurations.\nTo publish the most recently tagged build in your current branch you would run:\n\n    tito release yum-f15-x86_64\n\nYou can specify multiple targets on the CLI.\n\nSee \"man 8 releasers.conf\" for more information on defining release targets.\n\nSee \"man tito\" for more information on CLI arguments to \"tito release\".\n\n\n\nCUSTOM BUILDERS / TAGGERS / RELEASERS\n=====================================\n\nIf the existing implementations Tito provides are not sufficient for\nyour needs, it is possible to define a lib_dir in tito.props buildconfig\nsection. This is a directory that tito will add to the python path during\nexecution, allowing you a place to define your own custom implementations of\nbuilders, taggers, and releasers.\n\nThe process of actually writing a custom Builder/Tagger/Releaser is an exercise\nleft to the reader, but essentially you will want to work off the code in the\ntito.builder module. Inherit from the base Builder, and override the methods\nyou need to.\n\nPlease note that if you store your custom implementations inside your source\ntree, they will need to be kept in sync in all branches you are using for\nconsistent behavior. Also, there are no guarantees that tito will not change in\nfuture releases, meaning that your custom implementations may occasionally need\nto be updated.\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n===============\n\nIf you create a tag accidentally or that you wish to re-do, make sure you have\nnot git pushed the tag yet, the auto-commit is the most recent in your git\nhistory, and run:\n\n    git tag -d YOURNEWTAG\n    git reset --hard HEAD^1\n\nIf your project is standalone (no remote reference you communicate with as\nauthoritative) you may wish to set offline = \"true\" in .tito/tito.props under\nthe buildconfig section, so you do not need to specify --offline with each\ninvocation.\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n=============\n\nSee:\n\n    man 5 tito.props\n\n    man 5 releasers.conf\n\n    man 5 titorc\n\n\nCOMMUNITY\n=========\n\nIf you need an advice or want to chat with Tito developers, join us\non `#tito` channel at [irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/).\n\n\nProjects managed with Tito\n==========================\n\nHere follows a list of projects managed with Tito.
