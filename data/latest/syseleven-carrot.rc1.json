AMQP is the Advanced Message\nQueuing Protocol, an open standard protocol for message orientation, queuing,\nrouting, reliability and security.\n\nThe aim of `carrot` is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by\nproviding a high-level interface for producing and consuming messages. At the\nsame time it is a goal to re-use what is already available as much as possible.\n\n`carrot` has pluggable messaging back-ends, so it is possible to support\nseveral messaging systems. Currently, there is support for `AMQP`_\n(`py-amqplib`_, `pika`_), `STOMP`_ (`python-stomp`_). There's also an\nin-memory backend for testing purposes, using the `Python queue module`_.\n\nSeveral AMQP message broker implementations exists, including `RabbitMQ`_,\n`ZeroMQ`_ and `Apache ActiveMQ`_. You'll need to have one of these installed,\npersonally we've been using `RabbitMQ`_.\n\nBefore you start playing with ``carrot``, you should probably read up on\nAMQP, and you could start with the excellent article about using RabbitMQ\nunder Python, `Rabbits and warrens`_. For more detailed information, you can\nrefer to the `Wikipedia article about AMQP`_.\n\n.. _`RabbitMQ`: http://www.rabbitmq.com/\n.. _`ZeroMQ`: http://www.zeromq.org/\n.. _`AMQP`: http://amqp.org\n.. _`STOMP`: http://stomp.codehaus.org\n.. _`python-stomp`: http://bitbucket.org/asksol/python-stomp\n.. _`Python Queue module`: http://docs.python.org/library/queue.html\n.. _`Apache ActiveMQ`: http://activemq.apache.org/\n.. _`Django`: http://www.djangoproject.com/\n.. _`Rabbits and warrens`: http://blogs.digitar.com/jjww/2009/01/rabbits-and-warrens/\n.. _`py-amqplib`: http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/\n.. _`pika`: http://github.com/tonyg/pika\n.. _`Wikipedia article about AMQP`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nCarrot is using Sphinx, and the latest documentation is available at GitHub:\n\n    http://github.com/ask/carrot/\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install ``carrot`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)\nor from source.\n\nTo install using ``pip``,::\n\n    $ pip install carrot\n\n\nTo install using ``easy_install``,::\n\n    $ easy_install carrot\n\n\nIf you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it\nby doing the following,::\n\n    $ python setup.py build\n    # python setup.py install # as root\n\n\nTerminology\n===========\n\nThere are some concepts you should be familiar with before starting:\n\n    * Publishers\n\n        Publishers sends messages to an exchange.\n\n    * Exchanges\n\n        Messages are sent to exchanges. Exchanges are named and can be\n        configured to use one of several routing algorithms. The exchange\n        routes the messages to consumers by matching the routing key in the\n        message with the routing key the consumer provides when binding to\n        the exchange.\n\n    * Consumers\n\n        Consumers declares a queue, binds it to a exchange and receives\n        messages from it.\n\n    * Queues\n\n        Queues receive messages sent to exchanges. The queues are declared\n        by consumers.\n\n    * Routing keys\n\n        Every message has a routing key.  The interpretation of the routing\n        key depends on the exchange type. There are four default exchange\n        types defined by the AMQP standard, and vendors can define custom\n        types (so see your vendors manual for details).\n\n        These are the default exchange types defined by AMQP/0.8:\n\n            * Direct exchange\n\n                Matches if the routing key property of the message and\n                the ``routing_key`` attribute of the consumer are identical.\n\n            * Fan-out exchange\n\n                Always matches, even if the binding does not have a routing\n                key.\n\n            * Topic exchange\n\n                Matches the routing key property of the message by a primitive\n                pattern matching scheme. The message routing key then consists\n                of words separated by dots (``\".\"``, like domain names), and\n                two special characters are available; star (``\"*\"``) and hash\n                (``\"#\"``). The star matches any word, and the hash matches\n                zero or more words. For example ``\"*.stock.#\"`` matches the\n                routing keys ``\"usd.stock\"`` and ``\"eur.stock.db\"`` but not\n                ``\"stock.nasdaq\"``.\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nCreating a connection\n---------------------\n\n    You can set up a connection by creating an instance of\n    ``carrot.messaging.BrokerConnection``, with the appropriate options for\n    your broker:\n\n    >>> from carrot.connection import BrokerConnection\n    >>> conn = BrokerConnection(hostname=\"localhost\", port=5672,\n    ...                           userid=\"guest\", password=\"guest\",\n    ...                           virtual_host=\"/\")\n\n\n    If you're using Django you can use the\n    ``carrot.connection.DjangoBrokerConnection`` class instead, which loads\n    the connection settings from your ``settings.py``::\n\n       BROKER_HOST = \"localhost\"\n       BROKER_PORT = 5672\n       BROKER_USER = \"guest\"\n       BROKER_PASSWORD = \"guest\"\n       BROKER_VHOST = \"/\"\n\n    Then create a connection by doing:\n\n        >>> from carrot.connection import DjangoBrokerConnection\n        >>> conn = DjangoBrokerConnection()\n\n\n\nReceiving messages using a Consumer\n-----------------------------------\n\nFirst we open up a Python shell and start a message consumer.\n\nThis consumer declares a queue named ``\"feed\"``, receiving messages with\nthe routing key ``\"importer\"`` from the ``\"feed\"`` exchange.\n\nThe example then uses the consumers ``wait()`` method to go into consume\nmode, where it continuously polls the queue for new messages, and when a\nmessage is received it passes the message to all registered callbacks.\n\n    >>> from carrot.messaging import Consumer\n    >>> consumer = Consumer(connection=conn, queue=\"feed\",\n    ...                     exchange=\"feed\", routing_key=\"importer\")\n    >>> def import_feed_callback(message_data, message):\n    ...     feed_url = message_data[\"import_feed\"]\n    ...     print(\"Got feed import message for: %s\" % feed_url)\n    ...     # something importing this feed url\n    ...     # import_feed(feed_url)\n    ...     message.ack()\n    >>> consumer.register_callback(import_feed_callback)\n    >>> consumer.wait() # Go into the consumer loop.\n\nSending messages using a Publisher\n----------------------------------\n\nThen we open up another Python shell to send some messages to the consumer\ndefined in the last section.\n\n    >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher\n    >>> publisher = Publisher(connection=conn,\n    ...                       exchange=\"feed\", routing_key=\"importer\")\n    >>> publisher.send({\"import_feed\": \"http://cnn.com/rss/edition.rss\"})\n    >>> publisher.close()\n\n\nLook in the first Python shell again (where ``consumer.wait()`` is running),\nwhere the following text has been printed to the screen::\n\n   Got feed import message for: http://cnn.com/rss/edition.rss  \n\n\nSerialization of Data\n-----------------------\n\nBy default every message is encoded using `JSON`_, so sending\nPython data structures like dictionaries and lists works.\n`YAML`_, `msgpack`_ and Python's built-in ``pickle`` module is also supported,\nand if needed you can register any custom serialization scheme you\nwant to use.\n\n.. _`JSON`: http://www.json.org/\n.. _`YAML`: http://yaml.org/\n.. _`msgpack`: http://msgpack.sourceforge.net/\n\nEach option has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n``json`` -- JSON is supported in many programming languages, is now\n    a standard part of Python (since 2.6), and is fairly fast to \n    decode using the modern Python libraries such as ``cjson or \n    ``simplejson``.\n    \n    The primary disadvantage to ``JSON`` is that it limits you to \n    the following data types: strings, unicode, floats, boolean, \n    dictionaries, and lists.  Decimals and dates are notably missing.\n    \n    Also, binary data will be transferred using base64 encoding, which\n    will cause the transferred data to be around 34% larger than an \n    encoding which supports native binary types. \n    \n    However, if your data fits inside the above constraints and \n    you need cross-language support, the default setting of ``JSON``\n    is probably your best choice. \n    \n``pickle`` -- If you have no desire to support any language other than\n    Python, then using the ``pickle`` encoding will gain you \n    the support of all built-in Python data types (except class instances), \n    smaller messages when sending binary files, and a slight speedup\n    over ``JSON`` processing.\n\n``yaml`` -- YAML has many of the same characteristics as ``json``, \n    except that it natively supports more data types (including dates, \n    recursive references, etc.)\n    \n    However, the Python libraries for YAML are a good bit slower\n    than the libraries for JSON. \n    \n    If you need a more expressive set of data types and need to maintain\n    cross-language compatibility, then ``YAML`` may be a better fit\n    than the above. \n\nTo instruct carrot to use an alternate serialization method, \nuse one of the following options.\n\n    1.  Set the serialization option on a per-Publisher basis: \n        \n            >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher\n            >>> publisher = Publisher(connection=conn,\n            ...                       exchange=\"feed\", routing_key=\"importer\",\n            ...                       serializer=\"yaml\")\n\n    2.  Set the serialization option on a per-call basis\n\n            >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher\n            >>> publisher = Publisher(connection=conn,\n            ...                       exchange=\"feed\", routing_key=\"importer\")\n            >>> publisher.send({\"import_feed\": \"http://cnn.com/rss/edition.rss\"}, \n            ...                serializer=\"pickle\")\n            >>> publisher.close()\n\nNote that ``Consumer``s do not need the serialization method specified in \ntheir code.  They can auto-detect the serialization method since we supply \nthe ``Content-type`` header as part of the AMQP message.\n\n\nSending raw data without Serialization\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn some cases, you don't need your message data to be serialized. If you\npass in a plain string or unicode object as your message, then carrot will\nnot waste cycles serializing/deserializing the data.\n\nYou can optionally specify a ``content_type`` and ``content_encoding``\nfor the raw data:\n\n    >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher\n    >>> publisher = Publisher(connection=conn,\n    ...                       exchange=\"feed\",\n                              routing_key=\"import_pictures\")\n    >>> publisher.send(open('~/my_picture.jpg','rb').read(), \n                       content_type=\"image/jpeg\", \n                       content_encoding=\"binary\")\n    >>> publisher.close()\n    \nThe ``message`` object returned by the ``Consumer`` class will have a \n``content_type`` and ``content_encoding`` attribute. \n\n\nReceiving messages without a callback\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou can also poll the queue manually, by using the ``fetch`` method.\nThis method returns a ``Message`` object, from where you can get the\nmessage body, de-serialize the body to get the data, acknowledge, reject or\nre-queue the message.\n\n    >>> consumer = Consumer(connection=conn, queue=\"feed\",\n    ...                     exchange=\"feed\", routing_key=\"importer\")\n    >>> message = consumer.fetch()\n    >>> if message:\n    ...    message_data = message.payload\n    ...    message.ack()\n    ... else:\n    ...     # No messages waiting on the queue.\n    >>> consumer.close()\n\nSub-classing the messaging classes\n----------------------------------\n\nThe ``Consumer``, and ``Publisher`` classes can also be sub classed. Thus you\ncan define the above publisher and consumer like so:\n\n    >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher, Consumer\n\n    >>> class FeedPublisher(Publisher):\n    ...     exchange = \"feed\"\n    ...     routing_key = \"importer\"\n    ...\n    ...     def import_feed(self, feed_url):\n    ...         return self.send({\"action\": \"import_feed\",\n    ...                           \"feed_url\": feed_url})\n\n    >>> class FeedConsumer(Consumer):\n    ...     queue = \"feed\"\n    ...     exchange = \"feed\"\n    ...     routing_key = \"importer\"\n    ...\n    ...     def receive(self, message_data, message):\n    ...         action = message_data[\"action\"]\n    ...         if action == \"import_feed\":\n    ...             # something importing this feed\n    ...             # import_feed(message_data[\"feed_url\"])\n                    message.ack()\n    ...         else:\n    ...             raise Exception(\"Unknown action: %s\" % action)\n\n    >>> publisher = FeedPublisher(connection=conn)\n    >>> publisher.import_feed(\"http://cnn.com/rss/edition.rss\")\n    >>> publisher.close()\n\n    >>> consumer = FeedConsumer(connection=conn)\n    >>> consumer.wait() # Go into the consumer loop.\n\nGetting Help\n============\n\nMailing list\n------------\n\nJoin the `carrot-users`_ mailing list.\n\n.. _`carrot-users`: http://groups.google.com/group/carrot-users/\n\nBug tracker\n===========\n\nIf you have any suggestions, bug reports or annoyances please report them\nto our issue tracker at http://github.com/ask/carrot/issues/\n\nContributing\n============\n\nDevelopment of ``carrot`` happens at Github: http://github.com/ask/carrot\n\nYou are highly encouraged to participate in the development.
