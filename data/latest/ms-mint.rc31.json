These metabolites can provide valuable information about the state of an organism, including indicators of disease or other physiological changes. In order to perform a targeted metabolomics study, researchers typically use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to identify and quantify specific metabolites of interest.\n\nThe `ms-mint` library includes a range of functions for processing LCMS data from targeted metabolomics experiments, and it is particularly well-suited for handling large amounts of data (10,000+ files). To use `ms-mint`, you provide it with a target list of the specific metabolites you want to analyze, as well as the names of the mass spectrometry files containing the data. ms-mint then extracts peak intensities and other relevant information from the data, allowing you to gain insights into the concentrations and profiles of the metabolites in your samples. This information can be used to identify biomarkers, which are indicators of disease or other physiological changes that can be used in the development of diagnostic tests or other medical applications.\n\n## Documentation\nThe code documentation can be accessed [here](https://lewisresearchgroup.github.io/ms-mint/readme.html).\n\n## News\nMINT has been split into the Python library and the app. This repository contains the Python library. For the app follow [this link](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint-app).\n\n## Contributions\nAll contributions, bug reports, code reviews, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.\nBefore you modify the code please reach out to us using the [issues](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint/issues) page.\n\n## Code standards\nThe project follows PEP8 standard and uses Black and Flake8 to ensure a consistent code format throughout the project.\n\n---\n\n# Usage\n\nTo use the main class of the ms-mint library, you can import it into your code with the following command:\n\n    from ms_mint.Mint import Mint\n\nThis will import a lightweight version of the class with the essential functionality. If you want to use the ms-mint tool interactively in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you can import the class with the following command:\n\n    from ms_mint.notebook import Mint\n\nThis version of the class is designed specifically for use in Jupyter notebooks and includes additional functions. Once you have imported the appropriate version of the class, you can create an instance of the Mint class and use its methods to process your data.\n\n### ms-mint in JupyterLab, or the Jupyter Notebook\nIn the JupyterLab you would first instantiate the main class and then load a number of mass-spectrometry (MS) files and a target list.\n\n    %pylab inline\n    from ms_mint.notebook import Mint\n    mint = Mint()\n\n## Data extraction\n\n### Load files\nYou can import files simply by assigning a list to the `Mint.ms_files` attribute.\n\n    mint.ms_files = [\n        './input/EC_B2.mzXML',\n        './input/EC_B1.mzXML',\n        './input/CA_B1.mzXML',\n        './input/CA_B4.mzXML',\n        './input/CA_B2.mzXML',\n        './input/CA_B3.mzXML',\n        './input/EC_B4.mzXML',\n        './input/EC_B3.mzXML',\n        './input/SA_B4.mzML',\n        './input/SA_B2.mzML',\n        './input/SA_B1.mzML',\n        './input/SA_B3.mzML'\n    ]\n\nOr you can use the `Mint.load_files()` method which supports a string with regular expressions. The files in the previous function you could load with:\n\n    mint.load_files('./input/*.*')\n\nThis has the advantage that you can wildcards and you can chain your commands. For examle like this:\n\n    mint.load_files('./input/*.*').load_targets('targets.csv').run()\n    \n### Load target list\n\nThen you load the target definitions from a file the `load_targets` method is used:    \n    \n    mint.load_targets('targets.csv')\n    \n    mint.targets\n    >>>    peak_label    mz_mean  mz_width       rt  rt_min  rt_max  rt_unit  intensity_threshold target_filename\n        0    Arabitol  151.06050        10  4.92500    4.65    5.20      min                    0     targets.csv\n        1    Xanthine  151.02585        10  4.37265    4.18    4.53      min                    0     targets.csv\n        2   Succinate  117.01905        10  2.04390    0.87    2.50      min                    0     targets.csv\n        3   Urocanate  137.03540        10  4.41500    4.30    4.60      min                    0     targets.csv\n        4  Mevalonate  147.06570        10  3.00000    1.70    4.30      min                    0     targets.csv\n        5  Nicotinate  122.02455        10  3.05340    2.75    3.75      min                    0     targets.csv\n        6  Citrulline  174.08810        10  8.40070    8.35    8.50      min                    0     targets.csv\n\nThe retention time can be specified in minutes (rt_unit = 'min') or seconds (rt_unit = 's'). Mint will convert the values to SI unit seconds.\n\nYou can also prepare a `pandas.DataFrame` with the column names as shown above and assign it directly to the `Mint.targets` attribute:\n\n    mint.targets = my_targets_dataframe\n\n### Run data extraction\nWhen filenames and targets are loaded, the processing can be started by calling the `run()` method:\n\n    mint.run()  # Use mint.run(output_fn='results') for many files to prevent memory issues.\n\nThen the results will be stored in the `results` attribute:\n    mint.results\n    >>>\n    ...\n\n### Processing a large number of files\n\nIf you want to process a large number of files, you should provide an output filename. Then the results are written directly to that file instead of being stored in memory. \n\n    mint.run(fn='my-mint-output.csv')\n\n## Optimize retention times\n\nIf you only have retention time (Rt) values for your targets, or if the Rt values you have are not accurate, you can use the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function from the ms-mint library to generate better values for the `rt_min` and `rt_max` parameters. These parameters define the range of retention times within which `ms-mint` will search for peaks corresponding to your targets. By optimizing these values, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your results.\n\nTo use the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function, you will need to provide it with a list of retention times for your targets and the names of the mass spectrometry files containing your data. The function will then search through the data to find the optimal `rt_min` and `rt_max` values, which you can use to refine your analysis. You can then use these optimized values in conjunction with the other functions and methods of the `Mint` class to process and analyze your data.\n\n![](notebooks/peak-shapes-before-opt.png)\n\nNow, we can run the peak optimization with:\n\n    mint.opt.rt_min_max(\n        fns=[...]\n        peak_labels=['Xanthine', 'Succinate', 'Citrulline'],\n        plot=True, rel_height=0.7, sigma=50, col_wrap=1, aspect=3,\n        height=4\n    )\n\nThe `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function in the ms-mint library allows you to optimize the `rt_min` and `rt_max` values for your analysis. These values define the range of retention times within which ms-mint will search for peaks corresponding to your targets. By optimizing these values, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your results.\n\nIf you do not provide a list of peak_labels to the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function, it will run the optimization for all metabolites. Similarly, if you do not provide a list of filenames for the fn parameter, the function will use all of the files currently loaded into mint.ms_files. It is generally recommended to use a maximum of 20-40 files for the optimization process. If you have run a set of standards along with your samples (which is highly recommended), you can use the standard files to perform the optimization.\n\nAfter running the optimization, it is a good idea to perform a manual fine-tuning of the `rt_min` and `rt_max` values, especially for complicated peaks (peaks with multiple components, noisy peaks, etc.). You can use the `mint.plot.peak_shapes()` function to visualize the peak shapes and identify any areas that may require further attention.\n    \n![](notebooks/optimize-rt_min_max.png)\n\nThe black lines indicates the average intensity across all files used for the optimization. The orange dotted lines show the shape of the gaussian function used to weight the mean intensities for peak selection. The orange horizontal lines indicate the peak width and the blue `x`s show the identified peak maxima. The green shaded areas show the Rt ranges which were selected by the algorithm.\n\nThen we apply the changes and plot the new peak shapes:\n\n    mint.run()\n    mint.plot.peak_shapes(col_wrap=3)\n\n![](notebooks/peak-shapes-after-opt.png)\n\nAs you can see, the shapes of Xanthine, Succinate, Citrulline look much better.\n\n\n## Plotting and data exploration\n\nThe `Mint` class has a few convenient methods to visualize and explore the processed data. The results can be viewed directly in JupyterLab or stored to files using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` syntax. The figures are matplotlib objects and can be easily customised. \n\n## Plot peak shapes\n\n![](notebooks/peak-shapes-after-opt.png)\n\n    mint.plot.peak_shapes(col_wrap = 3)\n\nThe method uses seaborn [sns.relplot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.relplot.html) function and keyword arguments are passed on. \n\n\n## Hierarchical clustering\nMint ca be used to cluster the extracted data. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up clustering technique where each data point starts as its own cluster and then are merged with other clusters in a hierarchical manner based on their proximity or similarity until a single cluster is formed or a specified stopping criteria is met. The proximity is usually determined by a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, and the similarity is usually determined by a linkage function, such as ward linkage or complete linkage. The result is a tree-like representation called a dendrogram, which can be used to determine the number of clusters and the cluster assignments of the data points.\n\nMint uses `scipy.spartial.distance` to generate the distance matrix and `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` to perform the clustering. By default a 'cosine' metric is used to calculate the distances. Distances between row vectors and column vectors respectively can also be done using different metrics for each set. To do so a tuple with the names of the metrics has to be provided: `mint.hierarchical_clustering(metric=(\"euclidean\", \"cosine\")`.\n\nBefore clustering the data can be transformed and scaled. By default `log2p1(x) = log_2(x+1)` is used to transform the data and the standard scaler (z-scores) is used to normalize the variables for each target.\n\n    mint.plot.hierarchical_clustering(\n        data=None,  # Optional, dataframe. if None, mint.crosstab(targets_var) is executed to generate the data.\n        peak_labels=None,  # List of targets to include\n        ms_files=None,  # List of filenames to include\n        title=None,  # Title to add to the figure\n        figsize=(8, 8),  # Figure size\n        targets_var=\"peak_max\",  # Data variable to plot if data is None.\n        vmin=-3,  # Minimum value for color bar\n        vmax=3,  # Maximum value for color bar\n        xmaxticks=None,  # Maximum number of x-ticks to display\n        ymaxticks=None,  # Maximum number of y-ticks to display\n        transform_func=\"log2p1\",  # Transformation to use before scaling and clustering\n        scaler_ms_file=None,  # Experimental\n        scaler_peak_label=\"standard\",  # Scaler to use to normalize the data before clustering\n        metric=\"cosine\",  # Metric either a string or a 2-tuple of strings\n        transform_filenames_func=\"basename\",  # Transformation function to shorten filenames\n        transposed=False,  # Transpose the plot     \n        top_height=2,  # Height of the top-dendrogram\n        left_width=2,  # Width of the left-dendrogram\n        cmap=None  # Name of a matplotlib color map                \n    )\n\n\n![](notebooks/hierarchical_clustering.png)\n\n## Principal Components Analysis\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for dimensionality reduction. It transforms the original high-dimensional data into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables, called Principal Components (PCs), that capture the maximum variance in the data. The first PC accounts for the largest variance in the data, the second PC for the second largest variance, and so on. PCA is commonly used for data visualization, data compression, and noise reduction. By reducing the number of dimensions in the data, PCA allows us to more easily identify patterns and relationships in the data.\n\nBefore clustering the data can be transformed and scaled. By default log2p1(x) = log_2(x+1) is used to transform the data and the standard scaler (z-scores) is used to normalize the variables for each target.\n\n    mint.pca.run(n_components=5)\n    \nAfter running the PCA the results can be plotted with:    \n    \n    mint.pca.plot.pairplot(n_components=5, interactive=False)\n    \n![](notebooks/pca-pairplot.png)\n\n# FAQ\n## What is a target list\nA target list is a pandas dataframe with specific columns. \n\n-   **peak_label**: string, Label of the peak (must be unique).\n-   **mz_mean**: numeric value, theoretical m/z value of the target ion to extract.\n-   **mz_width**: numeric value, width of the peak in \\[ppm\\].
