    "description": "Easymunk\n========\n\n.. image::  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabiommendes/easymunk/master/docs/src/_static/easymunk_logo_animation.gif\n\nEasymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever\nyou need 2d rigid body physics from Python. Perfect when you need 2d physics\nin your game, demo or other application! It is built on top of the very \ncapable 2d physics library `Chipmunk <http://chipmunk-physics.net>`_.\n\nEasymunk is a fork of the excellent pymunk project, but it allows itself to deviate\nmore from the original C-library API. The goal is to explore a more Pythonic interface\nand tends to be easier to use and require less code to acomplish the same effects.\n\nThe first version was released in 2021, based on Pymunk 6.0. It owns greatly from Pymunk's\nmaturity and 10 years of active development. Easymunk is a laboratory and we hope to\ngive back code to Pymunk upstream and collaborate with its development.\n\n**Pymunk:** 2007 - 2020, Victor Blomqvist - vb@viblo.se, MIT License\n**Easymunk:** 2021, Fábio Macêdo Mendes - fabiomacedomendese@gmail.com, MIT License\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIn the normal case Easymunk can be installed from PyPI with pip::\n\n    > pip install easymunk-physics\n\nIt has a few dependencies that are installed automatically.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nQuick code example::\n    \n    import easymunk as mk       # Import easymunk.\n\n    space = mk.Space(           # Create a Space which contain the simulation\n        gravity=(0, -10),       # setting its gravity\n    )\n\n    body = space.create_box(    # Create a Body with mass, moment,\n        shape=(10, 20),         # position and shape.\n        mass=10,                \n        moment=150,\n        position=(50,100),\n    )\n\n    while True:                 # Infinite loop simulation\n        space.step(0.01)        # Step the simulation one step forward\n        space.debug_draw()      # Print the state of the simulation\n    \nFor more detailed and advanced examples, take a look at the included demos \n(in examples/).\n\nExamples are not included if you install with `pip install easymunk`. Instead you\nneed to download the source archive (easymunk-x.y.z.zip). Download available from\nhttps://pypi.org/project/easymunk/#files\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe source distribution of Easymunk ships with a number of demos of different\nsimulations in the examples directory, and it also contains the full \ndocumentation including API reference.\n\nYou can also find the full documentation including examples and API reference \non the Easymunk homepage, http://fabiommendes.github.io/easymunk.\n\n\nThe Easymunk Vision\n-------------------\n\n    \"*Make 2d physics easy to include in your game*\"\n\nIt is (or is striving to be):\n\n* **Easy to use** - It should be easy to use, no complicated code should be \n  needed to add physics to your game or program.\n* **\"Pythonic\"** - It should not be visible that a c-library (Chipmunk) is in \n  the bottom, it should feel like a Python library (no strange naming,\n  no memory handling and more)\n* **Simple to build & install** - You shouldn't need to have a zillion of \n  libraries installed to make it install, or do a lot of command line tricks.\n* **Multi-platform** - Should work on both Windows, \\*nix and OSX.\n* **Non-intrusive** - It should not put restrictions on how you structure \n  your program and not force you to use a special game loop, it should be \n  possible to use with other libraries like Pygame and Pyglet. \n\n  \nContact & Support\n-----------------\n.. _contact-support:\n\n**Homepage**\n    http://fabiommendes.github.io/easymunk\n\n**Stackoverflow**\n    You can ask questions/browse old ones at Stackoverflow, just look for \n    the Easymunk tag. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/easymunk\n\n**Issue Tracker**\n    Please use the issue tracker at github to report any issues you find:\n    https://github.com/fabiommendes/easymunk/issues\n    \nRegardless of the method you use I will try to answer your questions as soon \nas I see them. (And if you ask on SO other people might help as well!)\n\n\nDependencies / Requirements\n---------------------------\n\nBasically Easymunk have been made to be as easy to install and distribute as\npossible, usually `pip install easymunk-physics` will take care of everything for you.\n\n- Python (Runs on CPython 3.8 and later)\n- Chipmunk (Compiled library already included on common platforms)\n- CFFI (will be installed automatically by Pip)\n- Setuptools (should be included with Pip)\n\n* GCC and friends (optional, you need it to compile Easymunk from source. On\n  windows Visual Studio is required to compile)\n* Pygame (optional, you need it to run the Pygame based demos)\n* Pyglet (optional, you need it to run the Pyglet based demos)\n* Pyxel (optional, you need it to run the Pyxel based demos)\n* Streamlit (optional, you need it to run the streamlit based demos)\n* Matplotlib & Jupyter Notebook (optional, you need it to run the Matplotlib \n  based demos)\n* Sphinx & aafigure & sphinx_autodoc_typehints (optional, you need it to build \n  documentation)\n\n\nInstall from source / Chipmunk Compilation\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis section is only required in case you do not install easymunk from the\nprebuild binary wheels (normally if you do not use `pip install` or you are \non a uncommon platform).\n\nEasymunk is built on top of the c library Chipmunk. It uses CFFI to interface\nwith the Chipmunk library file. Because of this Chipmunk has to be compiled\ntogether with Easymunk as an extension module.\n\nThere are basically two options, either building it automatically as part of \ninstallation using for example Pip::\n\n    > pip install easymunk-source-dist.zip\n\nAnd Pip even accepts URL arguments, which can be used to fetch directly a\ncommit or the latest version in main::\n\n    > pip install https://github.com/fabiommendes/easymunk/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project or simply want to study Easymunk's code,\nit is recommended to clone the git repository and build from there::\n\n    > git clone http://github.com/fabiommendes/easymunk\n\nAfter cloning, initialize the repository with git submodules::\n\n    > cd easymunk\n    > git submodule update --init --recursive\n\nThis will download the Chipmunk2D source tree, which is necessary to compile the\nC-extension module used by easymunk. Now that the source code is available,\nbuild the extension module with::\n\n    > python setup.py build_ext\n\nFinally, install it with::\n\n    > python setup.py develop --user\n\nEasymunk requires Python 3.8+.",
