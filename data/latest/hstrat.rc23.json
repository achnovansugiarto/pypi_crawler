MRCA) to yield each extant packet.\nThis is done by means of annotations on the data being copied itself --- no centralized tracking system required.\n\nThis capability has direct applications in digital evolution research (e.g., artificial life, genetic programming, genetic algorithms), and also may prove useful for other distributed systems applications.\n\n![Cartoon showing relatedness estimation via a bitstring under neutral drift](docs/assets/bitstring_inference.png)\n\nA simple heritable annotation to enable relatedness estimation would be a bitstring under neutral drift.\nUnder this model, the number of generations elapsed since two bitstrings' MRCA would be inferred from the number of mismatching sites --- more mismatching sites would imply less relatedness.\nAn example scenario is shown above.\n\nThis model suffers from several serious drawbacks in application as a tool for relatedness estimation, including difficulty discerning uneven elapse of generations since MRCA and difficulty parameterizing the model for effective inference over greatly varying generational scales.\n\n![Cartoon showing relatedness estimation via a hereditary stratigraphic column](docs/assets/stratigraph_inference.png)\n\nInstead, we use randomly-generated binary \"fingerprints\" as a record of shared ancestry at a particular generation.\n\nAn example scenario is shown above.\nEach generation, a new randomly-generated \"fingerprint\" (drawn as a solid-colored rectangle above) is appended to the genome annotation.\nGenomes' annotations will share identical fingerprints for the generations they experienced shared ancestry.\nEstimation of the MRCA generation is straightforward: the first mismatching fingerprints denote the end of common ancestry.\n\nInternally, we refer to these \"fingerprints\" as _differentia_.\nThe bit width of differentiae controls the probability of spurious collision events (where strata happen to share the same randomly-generated value by chance), and is tunable by the end user.\n\nIn analogy to geological layering, we refer to the data deposited each generation (differentia and optional user-defined arbitrary annotations) as a _stratum_.\nWe call the annotation comprised of strata deposited at each generation a _hereditary stratigraphic column_.\nIn accordance, we describe this general approach for relatedness estimation _hereditary stratigraphy_.\n\n![Comparison of hereditary stratigraphic column before and after pruning retained strata](docs/assets/pruning.png)\n\nAs stated so far, hereditary stratigraphy suffers from a major pitfall: linear space complexity of the annotation with respect to the number of generations elapsed.\nThis means that time required to copy and transmit annotations, as well as memory requirements to store those annotations, will grow rapidly and without bound.\n\nSystematically pruning strata --- deleting data from certain generations from the annotation as generations elapse --- can reduce space complexity.\nHowever, pruning introduces uncertainty to MRCA generation estimates.\nThe exact last generation of common ancestry is bounded between the last-matching and first-mismatching strata, but cannot be resolved within that window.\n\nIn this way, hereditary stratigraphy exposes a direct, well-delimited, and flexible trade-off between space complexity and estimation accuracy.\nA pruning strategy must specify the set of strata to be pruned at each generational step.\nWe call the particular sequence of strata sets pruned at each generation a _stratum retention policy_.\n\n![Comparison of column size trajectories under stratum retention policies with different space complexities](docs/assets/pruning_intensity.png)\n\nThe most obvious consideration with respect to stratum retention policy is the number of strata to prune.\nIf, on average, one stratum is pruned for each added then a constant `O(1)` space complexity will be achieved.\nOn the other hand, pruning no strata or pruning every other, every third, etc. strata will yield a linear `O(n)` space complexity.\nIntermediate space complexities, such as `O(log(n))`, can also be achieved.\n\n![Comparison of even pruning and recency-proportional pruning](docs/assets/pruning_distribution.png)\n\nAnother, more subtle, stratum retention policy consideration is _where_ to prune.\nAn obvious choice might be to prune uniformly, yielding evenly-spaced retained strata.\nHowever, pruning may also be performed to distribute retained strata so that estimation windows provide fixed relative error rather than absolute error.\nThat is, error in MRCA generation estimation would be proportional to the number of generations elapsed since the true MRCA generation.\nSuch a strategy exchanges lower absolute error in estimating more recent MRCA events for higher absolute error in estimating more ancient MRCA events.\nThe cartoon above contrasts retained strata under even and recency-proportional pruning.\n\nRequirements on acceptable space-vs-resolution and distribution-of-resolution trade-offs will vary fundamentally between use cases.\nSo, the `hstrat` software accommodates modular, interchangeable specification of stratum retention policy.\nWe provide a library of predefined \"stratum retention algorithms,\" summarized below.\nHowever, end users can also use custom stratum retention algorithms defined within their own codebases outside the library, if needed.\n(Any custom algorithms with general appeal are welcome to be contributed back to the `hstrat` library!)\n\nMore detail on the rationale, implementation details, and performance guarantees of hereditary stratigraphy can be found in [(Moreno et al., 2022)](#moreno2022genome).\n\n## Available Stratum Retention Algorithms\n\nThe space-vs-resolution and distribution-of-resolution trade-offs of library-provided stratum retention algorithms are summarized below.\n\n| Stratum Retention Algorithm               | Space Complexity | MRCA Gen Uncertainty |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |\n| Fixed Resolution Algorithm                | `n/k`            | `k`                  |\n| Recency Proportional Resolution Algorithm | `k * log(n)`     | `m/k`                |\n| Depth Proportional Resolution Algorithm   | `k`              | `n/k`                |\n| Geometric Sequence Nth Root Algorithm     | `k`              | `m * n^(1/k)`        |\n\nwhere `n` is generations elapsed, `m` is generations since MRCA, and `k` is an arbitrary user-determined constant.\n\nNote that distribution-of-resolution trade-offs are described via the definition of uncertainty bounds in terms of generations since MRCA `m` versus overall generations elapsed `n`.\n\nThe `hstrat` library includes a suite of variants for several of these stratum retention algorithms.\nThese variants differ in terms of secondary considerations, for example whether column size exactly traces the asymptotic guarantee or fluctuates around it.\nComputational intensity to calculate the set of strata to be dropped at each generation may also differ between variants.\n\nThe next sections tour available stratum retention algorithms in detail.\n\n### Retention Drip Plot Visualization\n\n| No History

|\n\nBecause stratum retention policies unfold across space and time (i.e., the location of pruned strata and the generations at which they are pruned), the retention drip plot visualizations we use to depict them require a bit of explanation to get up to speed with.\nThis section builds up the visualizations step-by-step in the table above.\n(Note that the animations loop at 256 generations; if you are impatient you can refresh the page to restart the animations.)\n\nThe leftmost column animates the evolution of a single hereditary stratigraphic column over generations with no historical overlay.\nThe column itself is shown \"tipped over,\" appearing as a horizontal blue rectangle.\nUpside-down triangles are stratum within the column.\nThe position of strata in the `x` dimension correspond to the generation of their deposition; new strata are appended on the right.\nRetention status is depicted with color.\nBlack strata are retained and red strata have been pruned.\n\nThe center column uses the `y` dimension to introduce historical traces for retained strata.\nThe line below each retained stratum spans from the generation it was deposited to the current generation.\nNote that the column itself is positioned at the current generation at the top of the diagram.\n\nFinally, the rightmost column further layers on historical traces of pruned strata.\nInstead of having their trace deleted when pruned, their trace is turned red and frozen in place.\nSo, red traces span from the generation a pruned stratum was deposited to the generation it was pruned.\n\nAnimated panels below situate this visualization alongside additional graphs depicting absolute and relative estimation error across possible MRCA generations as well as relative and absolute column size (i.e., number of strata retained).\nTwo policy instantiations are visualized for each algorithm --- one yielded from a sparse parameterization and the other from a dense parameterization (i.e., one configured to retain fewer strata and one configured to retain more).\n\n### Depth Proportional Resolution Algorithm\n\nThe depth proportional resolution algorithm drops half of retained strata when a threshold size cap is met in order to maintain `O(1)` space complexity.\nRetained strata are evenly spaced.\n\n| Sparse Parameterization

this, a fixed number `k` of fixed-size subcomponents track `k` waypoints exponentially spaced backward from the most-recent stratum (i.e., spaced corresponding to the roots `0/k`, `1/k`, `2/k`, ...,

|\n\n### Other Algorithms\n\nThese stratum retention algorithms are less likely of interest to end users, included in the library primarily for testing and design validation, but are available nonetheless.\n\n- nominal resolution policy\n- perfect resolution policy\n- pseudostochastic policy\n- stochastic policy\n\n### Custom Algorithm Design\n\nCustom stratum retention algorithms can easily be substituted for supplied algorithms without performing any modifications to library code.\nTo start, you'll most likely want to copy an existing algorithm from `hstrat/stratum_retention_strategy/stratum_retention_algorithms` to use as an API scaffold.\n\nIf writing a custom stratum retention algorithm, you will need to consider\n\n1. Prune sequencing.\n\n   When you discard a stratum now, it won't be available later.\n   If you need a stratum at a particular time point, you must be able to guarantee it hasn't already been discarded at any prior time point.\n\n2. Column composition across intermediate generations.\n\n   For many use cases, resolution and column size guarantees will need to hold at all generations because the number of generations elapsed at the end of an experiment is not known _a priori_ or the option of continuing the experiment with evolved genomes is desired.\n\n3. Tractability of computing the deposit generations of retained strata at an arbitrary generation.\n\n   If this set of generations can be computed efficiently, then an efficient reverse mapping from column array index to deposition generation can be attained.\n   Such a mapping enables deposition generation to be omitted from strata, potentially yielding a 50%+ space savings (depending on the differentia bit width used).\n\n## Algorithm Parameterizers\n\nStratum retention algorithms can be automatically parameterized for desired properties.\nFor example, you may want to produce a policy from a particular algorithm that retains at most 100 strata at generation 1 million.\n\nTwo components are required to perform a parameterization.\n\nThe first, an \"evaluator\" controls which policy property is being parameterized for.\nAvailable options are\n\n- `MrcaUncertaintyAbsExactEvaluator`\n- `MrcaUncertaintyAbsUpperBoundEvaluator`\n- `MrcaUncertaintyRelExactEvaluator`\n- `MrcaUncertaintyRelUpperBoundEvaluator`\n- `NumStrataRetainedExactEvaluator`\n- `NumStrataRetainedUpperBoundEvaluator`\n\nThe second, a \"parameterizer\" controls whether the policy property should be paramaterized to be greater than, equal, or less than equal a target value.\nAvailable options are\n\n- `PropertyAtMostParameterizer`\n- `PropertyAtLeastParameterizer`\n- `PropertyExactlyParameterizer`\n\nThe evaluator should be provided as an argument to parameterizer, which should in turn be provided as an argument to the algorithm's `Policy` initializer.\n\n```python3\nstratum_retention_policy = hstrat.geom_seq_nth_root_tapered_algo.Policy(\n    parameterizer=hstrat.PropertyAtMostParameterizer(\n        target_value=127,\n        policy_evaluator \\\n            =hstrat.MrcaUncertaintyAbsExactEvaluator(\n                at_num_strata_deposited=256,\n                at_rank=0,\n        ),\n    ),\n)\n```\n\n## References\n\n<a id=\"moreno2022genome\" href=https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00550>\nMatthew Andres Moreno, Emily Dolson, Charles Ofria; July 18–22, 2022. \"Hereditary Stratigraphy: Genome Annotations to Enable Phylogenetic Inference over Distributed Populations.\" Proceedings of the ALIFE 2022: The 2022 Conference on Artificial Life.
