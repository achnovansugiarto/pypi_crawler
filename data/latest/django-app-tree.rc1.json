    "description": "# django-app-tree\n\nThis is a dependency checking / generating tool that highlights dependencies between apps.\n\nOne type of dependency is that models from app A have a reference to a model in app B.\n\nAnother one is simply where code is called.\n\nThe tool is a Django management command that can simply be called by\n\n```\n./manage.py dependency_tree\n```\n\nespecially\n\n```\n./manage.py dependency_tree --help\n```\n\nmight be helpful.\n\nThe final output is a graphviz file between the \"-----------\" lines\n\nJust copy it into an empty file and run the graphviz (https://graphviz.org/) compiler, e.g. with `dot dependencies.dot -Tpdf -o test.pdf` to generate a PDF.\n\nExample commands are:\n\n```\n./manage.py dependency_tree --contains-app=test --with-labels\n```\n\nto show all relations of the \"test\" app (from / to) and add the name of the models, functions or classes as labels.\n\nOr:\n\n```\n./manage.py dependency_tree --from-app=example --with-labels\n```\n\nto show which apps the \"example\" app calls code from.\n\nTo get the full picture of all relations, just call:\n\n```\n./manage.py dependency_tree --with-labels\n```\n\nBUT beware... you might not like what you see :)\n\n## Development\n\nInstall the pre-commit hooks:\n\n```\npre-commit install\npre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg\npre-commit install --hook-type pre-push\n```\n\nLocal python setup:\n\n```\npython3.10 -m venv .\nsource ./bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --editable .[dev,test,docs]\n```\n",
