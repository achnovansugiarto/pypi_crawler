More features will be added in the future.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere hasn't been any releases yet. Please wait patiently for the first release. If you want to get notified when the first release is available, you may click \"Watch -> Releases Only\" at the top right corner of the page.\n\nBefore the first release, you may install by typing:\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/shniubobo/text2beep.git#egg=text2beep\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n`text2beep` is easy to use. Simply prepare your sheet, then type:\n\n```\ntext2beep /path/to/your/sheet.json\n```\n\nand the program will start to read the sheet, and synthesize and play music according to it.\n\nThere are several example sheet files present in the `examples` directory. You may try them out before creating your own sheets.\n\nFor a complete option list of the tool, type `text2beep -h`.\n\n## Creating your own sheets\n\nCurrently only JSON sheets are supported. More formats may be supported in the future.\n\n### Structure of a sheet file\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bpm\": 120,\n  \"time_signature\": \"4/4\",\n  \"tracks\": [\n    [\n      \"E4--- C4--- D4--- G3---\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"C4--- A3--- B3--- E3---\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"A3--- F3--- G3--- C3---\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"A2--- F2--- G2--- C2---\"\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nwhere BPM (`bpm`) and time signature (`time_signature`) are used to determine the playing speed of the song, and `tracks` are all the tracks of the song.\n\nIf you want to split a sheet file into several parts, or specify different BPM and time signatures for different parts of your music, you can achieve these with `subsheets`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"subsheets\": [\n    {\n      \"bpm\": 120,\n      \"time_signature\": \"4/4\",\n      \"tracks\": [\n        [\n          \"E4--- C4---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"C4--- A3---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"A3--- F3---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"A2--- F2---\"\n        ]\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"bpm\": 120,\n      \"time_signature\": \"2/4\",\n      \"tracks\": [\n        [\n          \"D4--- G3---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"B3--- E3---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"G3--- C3---\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"G2--- C2---\"\n        ]\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAll subsheets will be played one by one, or you can specify the playing range with the `--range` option (see `text2beep -h` for details).\n\n### Syntax of tracks\n\n* Each track is a `list` (as is called in Python) or an `array` (as is called in JSON). All strings within the list are concatenated into a single one by the tool during runtime. Although you can put all the notes into one string, it is recommended to divide them into several ones to improve readability.\n* Spaces and `|` can be added arbitrarily to improve readability. They will be completely ignored by the program.\n* Notes in a track are played one by one. All tracks are played simultaneously.\n\n### Syntax of notes in the tracks:\n\n* The note name must be one of `CDEFGABX`, where `X` stands for rest notes.\n* If a note is not a rest note, an accidental `b` or `#` may be appended to it.\n* If a note is not a rest note, an octave from 0 to 8 needs to be specified.\n* Name first, accidental second, octave third. For example: `C#4`.\n* A note is a quarter note by default. For example, `C4` is a quarter note.\n* Each `-` extends the note value by 0.25. For example, `C4-` is a half note.\n* Any number of `-` may be used. For example, `C4---` is a whole note, while `C4--` is equal to `C4-+C4` (See below for `+`), although in this case the meaning of a dotted note (`C4--.`) is ambiguous, and thus the usage of two or more than three `-` is not recommended. In other words, use only `-` and `---`.\n* Each `/` shortens the note value by half. For example, `C4/` is an eighth note.\n* Notes can be dotted with `.`. For example, `C4.` is a dotted quarter note.\n* `-` and `/` cannot be present in the same note.\n* `+` can be used as a tie between notes (not a slur!).\n\n#### Some examples:\n\n| Note  | Value                          |\n| ----- | ------------------------------ |\n| X     | 0.25                           |\n| X-    | 0.5                            |\n| X---  | 1                              |\n| X/    | 0.125                          |\n| X//   | 0.0625                         |\n| X.    | 0.375 (0.25 + 0.125)           |\n| X..   | 0.4375 (0.25 + 0.125 + 0.0625) |\n| X/.   | 0.1875 (0.125 + 0.0625)        |\n| X-.   | 0.75 (0.5 + 0.25)              |\n| X+X// | 0.3125 (0.25 + 0.0625)         |\n\n## Example songs\n\n#### [`Astronauts.json`](examples/Astronauts.json) and [`Astronauts.full.json`](examples/Astronauts.full.json)\n\n* Song name: アストロノーツ\n* Song by: [椎名もた](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/nm14629738)\n* Arrangement by: [Xxoo00O00ooxX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Ug3SY2Ctc)\n\n#### [`Kokoronashi.json`](examples/Kokoronashi.json)\n\n* Song name: 心做し\n* Song by: [papiyon](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm22608740)\n* Arrangement by: [Xxoo00O00ooxX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOTwzoJ-iA)\n\n#### [`Melt.json`](examples/Melt.json)\n\n* Song name: メルト\n* Song by: [ryo](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1715919)\n* Arrangement by: [Clone of Nguyễn Thanh Hoàng Hải](https://musescore.com/user/3597581/scores/1046571)\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contribution is much appreciated.
