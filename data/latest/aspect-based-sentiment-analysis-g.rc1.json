    "description": "### Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis\n\nThe task is to classify the sentiment of potentially long texts for several aspects.\nThe key idea is to build a modern NLP package which supports explanations of model predictions.\nThe approximated decision explanations help you to infer how reliable predictions are.\nThe package is standalone, scalable, and can be freely extended to your needs.\nWe sum up thoughts in the article:\n<br>\n\n[**Do You Trust in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis? Testing and Explaining Model Behaviors**](https://rafalrolczynski.com/2021/03/07/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis/)\n\n<br>\n\nThere are over 100 repositories on GitHub around sentiment analysis \n<sup>\n[1](https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch)\n[2](https://github.com/jimmyyfeng/TD-LSTM)\n[3](https://github.com/davidsbatista/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis)\n[4](https://github.com/peace195/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis)\n[5](https://github.com/yardstick17/AspectBasedSentimentAnalysis)\n[6](https://github.com/thestrox/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis)\n[7](https://github.com/AlexYangLi/ABSA_Keras)\n[8](https://github.com/pedrobalage/SemevalAspectBasedSentimentAnalysis)\n[9](https://github.com/ganeshjawahar/mem_absa)\n</sup>.\nAll of them are hard to commercialize and reuse open-source research projects.\nWe clean up this excellent research. \nPlease give a star if you like the project. \nThis is important to keep this project alive.\n\n<br>\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe aim is to classify the sentiments of a text concerning given aspects. \nWe have made several assumptions to make the service more helpful. \nNamely, the text being processed might be a full-length document, \nthe aspects could contain several words (so may be defined more precisely), \nand most importantly, the service should provide an approximate explanation of any decision made, \ntherefore, a user will be able to immediately infer the reliability of a prediction.\n\n```python\nimport aspect_based_sentiment_analysis as absa\n\nnlp = absa.load()\ntext = (\"We are great fans of Slack, but we wish the subscriptions \"\n        \"were more accessible to small startups.\")\n\nslack, price = nlp(text, aspects=['slack', 'price'])\nassert price.sentiment == absa.Sentiment.negative\nassert slack.sentiment == absa.Sentiment.positive\n```\n\nAbove is an example of how quickly you can start to benefit from our open-source package. \nAll you need to do is to call the `load` function which sets up the ready-to-use pipeline `nlp`. \nYou can explicitly pass the model name you wish to use (a list of available models is below), or a path to your model. \nIn spite of the simplicity of using fine-tune models, we encourage you to build a custom model which reflects your data. \nThe predictions will be more accurate and stable. \n\n<br>\n\n### Pipeline: Keeping the Process in Shape\n\nThe pipeline provides an easy-to-use interface for making predictions.\nEven a highly accurate model will be useless if it is unclear how to correctly prepare the inputs and how to interpret the outputs.\nTo make things clear, we have introduced a pipeline that is closely linked to a model.\nIt is worth to know how to deal with the whole process, especially if you plan to build a custom model.\n\n\n<p align=\"middle\">\n<img src=\"examples/images/pipeline.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\"/>\n</p>\n\n\nThe diagram above illustrates an overview of the pipeline stages.\nAs usual, at the very beginning, we pre-process the inputs.\nWe convert the text and the aspects into a `task` which keeps examples (pairs of a text and an aspect) that we can then further tokenize, encode and pass to the model.\nThe model makes a prediction, and here is a change.\nInstead of directly post-processing the model outputs, we have added a review process wherein \nthe independent component called the `professor` supervises and explains a model prediction.\nThe professor might dismiss a model prediction if the model internal states or outputs seem suspicious.\nIn the article [here], we discuss in detail how the model and the professor work.\n\n````python\nimport aspect_based_sentiment_analysis as absa\n\nname = 'absa/classifier-rest-0.2'\nmodel = absa.BertABSClassifier.from_pretrained(name)\ntokenizer = absa.BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(name)\nprofessor = absa.Professor(...)     # Explained in detail later on.\ntext_splitter = absa.sentencizer()  # The English CNN model from SpaCy.\nnlp = absa.Pipeline(model, tokenizer, professor, text_splitter)\n\n# Break down the pipeline `call` method.\ntask = nlp.preprocess(text=..., aspects=...)\ntokenized_examples = nlp.tokenize(task.examples)\ninput_batch = nlp.encode(tokenized_examples)\noutput_batch = nlp.predict(input_batch)\npredictions = nlp.review(tokenized_examples, output_batch)\ncompleted_task = nlp.postprocess(task, predictions)\n````\n\nAbove is an example how to initialize the pipeline directly,\nand we revise in code the process being discussed by exposing what calling the pipeline does under the hood.\nWe have omitted a lot of insignificant details but there's one thing we would like to highlight.\nThe sentiment of long texts tends to be fuzzy and neutral. \nTherefore, you might want to split a text into smaller independent chunks, sometimes called spans. \nThese could include just a single sentence or several sentences.\nIt depends on how the `text_splitter` works. \nIn this case, we are using the SpaCy CNN model, which splits a document into single sentences, \nand, as a result each sentence can then be processed independently.\nNote that longer spans have richer context information, so a model will have more information to consider.\nPlease take a look at the pipeline details [here](aspect_based_sentiment_analysis/pipelines.py).\n\n<br>\n\n### Supervising Model Predictions\n\nIt's time to explain model reasoning, something which is extremely hard.\nThe key concept is to frame the problem of explaining a model decision as an independent task wherein\nan aux. model, the `pattern recognizer`, predicts patterns (weighted compositions of tokens, presented below) given model inputs, outputs, and internal states.\nDue to time constraints, at first we did not want to research and build a trainable pattern recognizer.\nInstead, we decided to start with a pattern recognizer that originates from our observations, prior knowledge.\nThe model, the aspect-based sentiment classifier, is based on the transformer architecture wherein self-attention layers hold the most parameters.\nTherefore, one might conclude that understanding self-attention layers is a good proxy to understanding a model as a whole.\nAccordingly, there are many articles that show how to explain a model decision \nin simple terms, using attention values (internal states of self-attention layers) straightforwardly.\nInspired by these articles, we have also analyzed attention values (processing training examples) to search for any meaningful insights.\nThis exploratory study has led us to create the `BasicPatternRecognizer` (details are [here](aspect_based_sentiment_analysis/aux_models.py)).\n\n```python\nimport aspect_based_sentiment_analysis as absa\n\nrecognizer = absa.aux_models.BasicPatternRecognizer()\nnlp = absa.load(pattern_recognizer=recognizer)\ncompleted_task = nlp(text=..., aspects=['slack', 'price'])\nslack, price = completed_task.examples\n\nabsa.summary(slack)\nabsa.display(slack.review)\n```\n\n<p align=\"middle\">\n<img src=\"examples/images/slack-patterns.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\"/>\n</p>\n\n```python\nabsa.summary(price)\nabsa.display(price.review)\n```\n\n<p align=\"middle\">\n<img src=\"examples/images/price-patterns.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\"/>\n</p>\n\nThe explanations are only useful if they are correct.\nTo form the basic pattern recognizer, we have made several assumptions (prior beliefs),\ntherefore we should be careful about interpreting the explanations too literally.\nEven if the attention values have thought-provoking properties, for example, \nthey encode rich linguistic relationships, there is no proven chain of causation.\nThere are a lot of articles that illustrate various concerns why drawing conclusions about model reasoning\ndirectly from attentions might be misleading.\nIn the article [here](https://rafalrolczynski.com/2021/03/07/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis/), we validate and analyse explanations in detail.\n\n<br>\n\n### Ready-to-Use Models\n\nIn the table below, we present the State of the Art results on the SemEval 2014 evaluation dataset \n(dataset details are [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/)).\nThere are two available models for the restaurant and the laptop domains.\nThe model implementation details [here](aspect_based_sentiment_analysis/models.py).\nThe hyper-parameters optimization (with the explanation how to train a model) is [here](examples/train_classifier.py).\nYou can easily reproduce our evaluations, look at the performance tests [here](tests/test_performance.py).\n\n| Model Name | Acc Rest | Acc Lapt | Release |\n|
