    "description": "# Responsible AI Mitigations\n\n\nThis Responsible-AI-Toolbox-Mitigations repo consists of a python library that aims to empower data scientists and ML developers to measure their dataset balance and representation of different dataset cohorts, while having access to mitigation techniques they could incorporate to mitigate errors and fairness issues in their datasets. Together with the measurement and mitigation steps, ML professionals are empowered to build more accurate and fairer models.\n\nThis repo is a part of the [Responsible AI Toolbox](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox#responsible-ai-toolbox), a suite of tools providing a collection of model and data exploration and assessment user interfaces and libraries that enable a better understanding of AI systems. These interfaces and libraries empower developers and stakeholders of AI systems to develop and monitor AI more responsibly, and take better data-driven actions.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./docs/imgs/responsible-ai-toolbox-mitigations.png\" alt=\"ResponsibleAIToolboxMitigationsOverview\" width=\"750\"/>\n\nThe Responsible AI Mitigations Library helps AI practitioners explore different measurements and mitigation steps that may be most appropriate when the model underperforms for a given data cohort. The library currently has three modules:\n\n- **DataProcessing** offers mitigation techniques for improving model performance for specific cohorts.\n- **DataBalanceAnalysis** provides metrics for diagnosing errors that originate from data imbalance either on class labels or feature values.\n- **Cohort** provides classes for handling and managing cohorts, which allows the creation of custom pipelines for each cohort in an easy and intuitive interface. The module also provides techniques for learning different decoupled estimators (models) for different cohorts and combining them in a way that optimizes different definitions of group fairness.\n\n\nIn this library, we take a **targeted approach to mitigating errors** in Machine Learning models. This is complementary and different from the traditional blanket approaches which aim at maximizing a single-score performance number, such as overall accuracy, by merely increasing the size of traning data or model architecture. Since blanket approaches are often costly but also ineffective for improving the model in areas of poorest performance, with targeted approaches to model improvement we focus the improvement efforts in areas previously identified to have more errors and their underlying diagnoses of error. For example, if a practitioner has identified that the model is underperforming for a cohort of interest by using Error Analysis in the Responsible AI Dashboard, they may also continue the debugging process by finding out through Data Balance Analysis and find out that there is class imbalance for this particular cohort. To mitigate the issue, they then focus on improving class imbalance for the cohort of interest by using the Responsible AI Mitigations library. This and several other examples in the documentation of each mitigation function illustrate how targeted approaches may help practitioner best at mitigation giving them more control in the model improvement process.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the following pip command to install the Responsible AI Toolbox.

Most contributions require you to agree to a\nContributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us\nthe rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide\na CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions\nprovided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n### Installing Using ``dev`` Mode\n\nAfter cloning this repo and moving to its root folder, install the package in editable mode with the development dependencies using:\n\n```console\n> pip install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n### Pre-Commit\n\nThis repository uses pre-commit hooks to guarantee that the code format is kept consistent. For development, make sure to\nactivate pre-commit before creating a pull request. Any code pushed to this repository is checked for code consistency using\nGithub Actions, so if pre-commit is not used when doing a commit, there is a chance that it fails in the format check workflow.\nUsing pre-commit will avoid this.\n\nTo use pre-commit with this repository, first install pre-commit (**NOTE:** when installing the package with the ``[dev]`` tag, the\n``pre-commit`` package will already be installed):\n\n```console\n> pip install pre-commit\n```\n\nAfter installed, navigate to the root directory of this repository and activate pre-commit through the following command:\n\n```console\n> pre-commit install\n```\n\nWith pre-commit installed and activated, whenever you do a new commit, pre-commit will check all new code using the pre-commit hooks configured in the *.pre-commit-config.yaml* file, located in the root of the repository. Some of the hooks might make formatting changes to some of the files commited. If any file is changed or if any other hook fails, the commit will fail. If that happens, make the necessary modifications, add the files to the commit and try commiting one more time. Do this until all hooks are successful. Note that these same checks will be done after pushing anything, so if your commit was successful while using pre-commit, it will pass in the format check workflow as well.\n\n### Updating the Docs\n\nThe documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) (to build the class diagrams). Graphviz and Pandoc must be installed separately ([detailed instructions here for Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) and [here for Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)). On Linux, this can be done with `apt` or `yum` (depending on your distribution):\n\n```console\n> sudo apt install graphviz pandoc\n```\n\n```console\n> sudo yum install graphviz pandoc\n```\n\nMake sure Graphviz and Pandoc are installed before recompiling the docs. After that, update the documentation files, which are all located inside the ```docs/``` folder. Finally, use:\n\n```console\n> cd docs/\n> make html\n```\n\nTo view the documentation, open the file ```docs/_build/html/index.html``` in your browser.\n\n**Note for Windows users:** if you are trying to update the docs in a Windows environment, you might get an error regarding the *_sqlite3* module:\n\n```\nImportError: DLL load failed while importing _sqlite3: The specified module could not be found.\n```\n\nTo fix this, following the instructions found [in this link](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-fix-importerror-dll-load-failed-while-importing-_sqlite3-the-specified-module-could-not-be-found/).\n\n\n## Support\n### How to file issues and get help\n\nThis project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing\nissues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or\nfeature request as a new Issue.\n\nFor help and questions about using this project, please post your question in Stack Overflow using the ``raimitigations`` tag.\n\n### Microsoft Support Policy\n\nSupport for this package is limited to the resources listed above.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.
