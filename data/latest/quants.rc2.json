    "description": "# quants package\n\nPackage for Artifical Neural Network (**ANN**) based learning of quantifiers.\n\nIt contains definition of scenes of elements and classes for both quantifier sampling and NN simple example package.\n\n\n## Classes\n\n### Quantifer classes\nThese classes are a quantifier hierarchy with methods and definitions for:\n* *Scenes* that are composed of world *elements* pertaining to use of a sentence of the form \"**q as are bs**\".\n* Construction of quantifier if parameters (such as in the case of ExactlyN for instance) are required.\n* Static method for generation of a completely random scene.\n* Generation of permuted prototype scenes that are evaluated as true under the given quantifier q.\n* Evaluation of a given scene (returns **TRUE** for scenes generated by the same quantifier q in the previous method).\n\n### Classifier class approach\nThis approach assumes that quantifiers are learned as a group, essentially each quantifier q **TRUE** *scene* is a negative example for all other quantifiers q'.\nThere is of course many scenes for which more than one quantifier is evaluated as **TRUE**, for instance if \"Both students are eating\" is **TRUE** then \"Some students are eating\" is also **TRUE**, this can be mitigated by implicatures which we do not address.\n\nThe classifier is in effect a solver for which q makes the sentence \"**q as are bs**\" most likely given an input *scene* s.\n\nThis enables us to use not only the quantifier quantify evaluation methods but the classifier in order to generate a teacher-student scheme.\n\n### AE approach\nThe AE approach tries to let an AE look at *scenes* where a given quantifier q was used by a teacher (language speaker), this is repeated many times till whatever structure typical to scenes **TRUE** under the quantifier q are encoded in the AE hidden values' represented structure. When learning is complete and when we are given a scene we use the AE as an anomaly detector to decide whether the scene is True under the quantifier q. The idea is that after seeing many q **TRUE** scenes a non q **TRUE** scene will have relatively high reconstruction errors.",
