It calculates a separate enrichment score for each sample and gene set pairing [[1]](#1).\n\n## Install the latest version\n\n    pip install single_sample_gsea\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\n>>> from single_sample_gsea import ss_gsea\n\n>>> gene_sets = {\n    \"gs1\": {\"gene2\", \"gene3\"},\n    \"gs2\": {\"gene1\", \"gene4\"},\n    }\n\n>>> data = {\n    \"gene\": [\"gene1\", \"gene2\", \"gene3\", \"gene4\", \"gene5\"],\n    \"sample-1\": [1, 3, 4, 7, 32],\n    \"sample-2\": [25, 4, 6, 18, 1],\n    }\n>>> data = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index(\"gene\")\n\n>>> ss_gsea(data, gene_sets)\n               gs1       gs2\nsample-1 -1.333333 -0.962974\nsample-2 -1.333333  2.543214\n```\n\n## References\n\n<a id=\"1\">[1]</a>\nBarbie, D., Tamayo, P., Boehm, J. et al.
