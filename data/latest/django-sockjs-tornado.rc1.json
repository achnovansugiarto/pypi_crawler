    "description": "django-sockjs-tornado\n=====================\n\nMakes it easy to run a SockJS server in Django through Tornado.\n\nThis package is basically a thin wrapper on top of `sockjs-tornado\n<https://github.com/mrjoes/sockjs-tornado>`_ which makes it dead easy\nto write websocket based apps on top of the `sockjs Websocket\nemulation library <http://sockjs.org/>`_.\n\nWith this wrapper you basically have access to everything else you\nneed from your Django project such as your models and your various\nsettings.\n\nBecause you need to run two processes (one for `runserver` (or `wsgi`)\nand one for `socketserver`) it means that the two really are separate\npython processes so you can't easily do things like registering\nsignals and trigger them in one process and have them fire in another.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nCreate a class somewhere that looks something like this::\n\n    from sockjs.tornado import SockJSConnection\n\n    class MyConnection(SockJSConnection):\n        def on_open(self, request):\n             pass\n        def on_message(self, message):\n             pass\n        def on_close(self):\n             pass\n\nNext, you need to put the loction of this in a setting in your\n`settings.py` something like this::\n\n    SOCKJS_CLASSES = (\n        'myproject.myapp.myfile.MyConnection',\n    )\n\n\nNext, to start the server simply run::\n\n    python manage.py socketserver [--help]\n\nYou'll still have your regular django server too in a separate terminal::\n\n    python manage.py runserver\n\nNow you should be able to write the juicy Javascript using\n`sockjs-client <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client>`_. You can\nstart by downloading the `latest minified version from the CDN\n<http://cdn.sockjs.org/>`_.\n\nA simple app might look like this::\n\n    sock = new SockJS('http://localhost:9999/echo');\n    sock.onmessage = function(e) {\n      console.log(e.data);\n    };\n    sock.onclose = function() {\n      console.log('closed :(');\n    };\n    sock.onopen = function() {\n      console.log('opened :>');\n      letTheMadnessBegin();\n    };\n\n    function letTheMadnessBegin() {\n      // silly, but you get the idea\n      sock.send(JSON.stringify({\n        name: $('#name').text(),\n        message: $('input').val()\n      }));\n    }\n\nGetting fancy\n-------------\n\nThere's a shitload more things you can do with this of course. For\nexample, you might want to add some form of authentication. Since the\n`on_open` handler receives a request you can use that to ask for\n`request.get_cookie()` which is left to the reader as an exercise.\n\nThere is a slightly more fancy example included in this package under\nexample which might get you some ideas. It's a fully working chat\napplication that just works.\n\nThis package is built mainly on `Serve Koval\n<https://github.com/mrjoes>`_'s amazing work on `sockjs-tornado\n<https://github.com/mrjoes/sockjs-tornado>`_ which has lots of more\nexamples and documentation that might help you. For example, it lists\nto a sample HAProxy configuration which you might need once you take\nyour project live since you can't keep exposing port 9999 on a\nproduction system.",
