    "description": "# PyGaggle\n\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pygaggle?color=brightgreen)](https://pypi.org/project/pygaggle/)\n[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\nPyGaggle provides a gaggle of deep neural architectures for text ranking and question answering.\nIt was designed for tight integration with [Pyserini](http://pyserini.io/), but can be easily adapted for other sources as well.\n\nCurrently, this repo contains implementations of the rerankers for MS MARCO Passage Retrieval, MS MARCO Document Retrieval, TREC-COVID and [CovidQA](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/data/).\n\n## Installation\n\n0. Install via PyPI `pip install pygaggle`. Requires [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n## Additional Instructions\n\n0. Clone the repo with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle.git`\n\n0. Make you sure you have an installation of [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). All `python` commands below refer to this.\n\n0. For pip, do `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n    * If you prefer Anaconda, use `conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate pygaggle`.\n\n\n## A Simple Reranking Example\n\nHere's how to initalize the T5 reranker from [Document Ranking with a Pretrained Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06713.pdf):\n\n```python\nfrom pygaggle.rerank.base import Query, Text\nfrom pygaggle.rerank.transformer import MonoT5\n\nreranker =  MonoT5()\n```\n\nAlternatively, here's the BERT reranker from [Passage Re-ranking with BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04085.pdf), which isn't as good as the T5 reranker:\n\n```python\nfrom pygaggle.rerank.base import Query, Text\nfrom pygaggle.rerank.transformer import MonoBERT\n\nreranker =  MonoBERT()\n```\n\nEither way, continue with a complete reranking example:\n\n```python\n# Here's our query:\nquery = Query('who proposed the geocentric theory')\n\n# Option 1: fetch some passages to rerank from MS MARCO with Pyserini\nfrom pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher\nsearcher = SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-passage')\nhits = searcher.search(query.text)\n\nfrom pygaggle.rerank.base import hits_to_texts\ntexts = hits_to_texts(hits)\n\n# Option 2: here's what Pyserini would have retrieved, hard-coded\npassages = [['7744105', 'For Earth-centered it was  Geocentric Theory proposed by greeks under the guidance of Ptolemy and Sun-centered was Heliocentric theory proposed by Nicolas Copernicus in 16th century A.D.
