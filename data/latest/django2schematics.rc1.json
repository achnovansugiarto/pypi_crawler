This won't\r\nkeep your stuff synced.\r\n\r\nIt's still useful, however. Sometimes you're converting a large Django code\r\nbase to domain models in schematics. In those cases, it's a royal pain to\r\nmechanically retype hundreds of models and thousands of field definitions by\r\nhand.\r\nWe have computers for that, you know.\r\n\r\nYou can either run this as a stand alone script or use it as a library.\r\n\r\nAs a Stand Alone Script\r\n-----------------------\r\nAdd django2schematics to your `INSTALLED_APPS` settings. Then::\r\n\r\n    python manage.py 2_schematics app_name\r\n\r\nYou can specify full apps or models to export. By default the script will output\r\nto stdout. The `--to-file` flag will save each app models into\r\n`[app-dir]/domain-raw.py`.\r\n\r\nSee `--help` for more options.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a Library\r\n------------\r\nIf you'd rather process the ouput your self then::\r\n\r\n    from django2scheamtics.exporter import SchematicsModel\r\n    SchematicsModel.from_django(the_model_class)\r\n    # or as a string\r\n    SchematicsModel.from_django(the_model_class).to_string()\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n--------\r\nLet me know if this works (or doesn't) for you. Feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\nFeedback with accompanying pull requests and tests will buy you a beer on me next\r\ntime you're in SÃ£o Paulo. Or tea, if that's your thing.",
