For each of the\npickings that meet this condition, an activity will be created indicating\nthat the 'scheduled date' must be updated.\n\nThe operation types that will be taken into account are those that you\ndetermine by checking a specific checkbox for that.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure this module, you need to:\n\n#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Operations Types*\n#. Open the operation type for which you want late picking activities\n   to be generated.\n#. Check 'Create Late Picking Activity' checkbox, select the user who\n   will be responsible for the generated activity and save the form.\n#. From time to time, your system will check if exist late pickings\n   ('scheduled date' is before current date) and will create an\n   activity for them, with the user selected in the corresponding\n   operation type as responsible.\n\nThis module generates a 'scheduled action' to create the late picking\nactivities when is needed. To adjust the parameters for that:\n\n#. Go to * Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions *\n#. Finds the 'scheduled action' named 'Picking: activities for late pickings'\n#. Edit it and adjust the parameters if you need and save the form.\n\nThe late picking activities created will be associated with a new\n'activity type'. If you want to adjust the parameters of that:\n\n#. Go to * Settings> Technical> Email> Activity Types *\n#. Find the 'activity type' named 'Late picking'\n#. Edit it and adjust the parameters if you need and save the form.\n\nNote: The summary and note of the created activities will be the same\ndefined as summary in the 'activity type' named 'Late picking'.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_picking_late_activity%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * Ernesto Tejeda\n  * Pedro M.
