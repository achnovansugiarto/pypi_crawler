    "description": "PyInstaller Overview\n====================\n\nPyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single\npackage. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python\ninterpreter or any modules.\n\n\n:Documentation: https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/\n:Website:       http://www.pyinstaller.org/\n:Code:          https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller\n:Donate:        | https://www.bountysource.com/teams/pyinstaller\n                | Bitcoin: 1JUFjawzWDR7Tc8z9TKXstVFdjkDY9FbtK\n                | `more ways to donate … <http://www.pyinstaller.org/donate.html>`_\n\n\nPyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code\nto discover every other module and library your script needs in order to\nexecute. Then it collects copies of all those files -- including the active\nPython interpreter! -- and puts them with your script in a single folder, or\noptionally in a single executable file.\n\n\nPyInstaller is tested against Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, it is not\na cross-compiler: to make a Windows app you run PyInstaller in Windows; to make\na Linux app you run it in Linux, etc. PyInstaller has been used successfully\nwith AIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD, but is not tested against them.\n\n\nMain Advantages\n---------------\n\n- Works out-of-the-box with any Python version 2.7 / 3.4-3.7.\n- Fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries,\n  thus ensuring full compatibility.\n- Correctly bundles the major Python packages such as numpy, PyQt4, PyQt5,\n  PySide, Django, wxPython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.\n- Compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (All the required\n  tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)\n- Libraries like PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide, wxPython, matplotlib or Django are fully\n  supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.\n- Working code signing on OS X.\n- Bundles MS Visual C++ DLLs on Windows.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPyInstaller is available on PyPI. You can install it through `pip`::\n\n      pip install pyinstaller\n\n\nRequirements and Tested Platforms\n------------------------------------\n\n- Python: \n\n - 2.7 or 3.4-3.7\n - PyCrypto_ 2.4+ (only if using bytecode encryption)\n\n- Windows (32bit/64bit):\n\n - Windows XP or newer.\n    \n- Linux (32bit/64bit)\n\n - ldd: Console application to print the shared libraries required\n   by each program or shared library. This typically can be found in\n   the distribution-package `glibc` or `libc-bin`.\n - objdump: Console application to display information from \n   object files. This typically can be found in the\n   distribution-package `binutils`.\n - objcopy: Console application to copy and translate object files.\n   This typically can be found in the distribution-package `binutils`,\n   too.\n\n- Mac OS X (64bit):\n\n - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or newer.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBasic usage is very simple, just run it against your main script::\n\n      pyinstaller /path/to/yourscript.py\n\nFor more details, see the `manual`_.\n\n\nUntested Platforms\n---------------------\n\nThe following platforms have been contributed and any feedback or\nenhancements on these are welcome.\n\n- FreeBSD\n\n - ldd\n\n- Solaris\n\n - ldd\n - objdump\n\n- AIX\n\n - AIX 6.1 or newer. PyInstaller will not work with statically\n   linked Python libraries.\n - ldd\n\n- PowerPC Linux (Debian)\n\n\nBefore using any contributed platform, you need to build the PyInstaller\nbootloader, as we do not ship binary packages. Download PyInstaller\nsource, and build the bootloader::\n     \n        cd bootloader\n        python ./waf distclean all\n\nThen install PyInstaller::\n\n        python setup.py install\n        \nor simply use it directly from the source (pyinstaller.py).\n\n\n\n.. _PyCrypto: https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/\n.. _`manual`: https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4/\n\n\n\n.. Define some roles so they can be used in the README.\n\n.. role:: ref\n.. role:: program\n.. role:: pep\n.. role:: issue\n\n\nChangelog for PyInstaller\n=========================\n\n.. NOTE:\n\n   You should *NOT* be adding new change log entries to this file, this\n   file is managed by towncrier. You *may* edit previous change logs to\n   fix problems like typo corrections or such.\n\n   To add a new change log entry, please see\n   https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/changelog-entries.html\n\n.. towncrier release notes start\n\n3.4 (2018-09-09)\n----------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add support for Python 3.7 (:issue:`#2760`, :issue:`#3007`, :issue:`#3076`,\n  :issue:`#3399`, :issue:`#3656`), implemented by Hartmut Goebel.\n* Improved support for Qt5-based applications (:issue:`#3439`).\n  By emulating much of the Qt deployment tools' behavior\n  most PyQt5 variants are supported.\n  However, Anaconda's PyQt5 packages are not supported\n  because its ``QlibraryInfo`` implementation reports incorrect values.\n  CI tests currently run on PyQt5 5.11.2. Many thanks to Bryan A. Jones for\n  taking this struggle.\n* ``--debug`` now allows more debugging to be activated more easily. This\n  includes bootloader messages, Python's \"verbose imports\" and store collected\n  Python files in the output directory instead of freezing. See ``pyinstaller\n  –help`` for details. (:issue:`#3546`, :issue:`#3585`, :issue:`#3587`)\n* Hint users to install development package for missing `pyconfig.h`.\n  (:issue:`#3348`)\n\n* In ``setup.py`` specify Python versions this distribution is compatible with.\n* Make base_library.zip reproducible: Set time-stamp of files. (:issue:`#2952`,\n  :issue:`#2990`)\n* New command-line option ``--bootloader-ignore-signals`` to make the\n  bootloader forward all signals to the bundle application. (:issue:`#208`,\n  :issue:`#3515`)\n* (OS X) Python standard library module ``plistlib`` is now used for generating\n  the ``Info.plist`` file. This allows passing complex and nested data in\n  ``info_plist``. (:issue:`#3532`, :issue:`#3541`)\n\n\nBugfix\n~~~~~~\n\n* Add missing ``warnings`` module to ``base_library.zip``. (:issue:`#3397`,\n  :issue:`#3400`)\n* Fix and simplify search for libpython on windows, msys2, cygwin.\n  (:issue:`#3167`, :issue:`#3168`)\n* Fix incompatibility with `pycryptodome` (replacement for the (apparently\n  abandoned) `pycrypto` library when using encrypted PYZ-archives.\n  (:issue:`#3537`)\n* Fix race condition caused by the bootloader parent process terminating before\n  the child is finished. This might happen e.g. when the child process itself\n  plays with ``switch_root``. (:issue:`#2966`)\n* Fix wrong security alert if a filename contains ``..``. (:issue:`#2641`,\n  :issue:`#3491`)\n* Only update resources of cached files when necessary to keep signature valid.\n  (:issue:`#2526`)\n* (OS X) Fix: App icon appears in the dock, even if ``LSUIElement=True``.\n  (:issue:`#1917`, :issue:`#2075`, :issue:`#3566`)\n* (Windows) Fix crash when trying to add resources to Windows executable using\n  --resource option. (:issue:`#2675`, :issue:`#3423`)\n* (Windows) Only update resources when necessary to keep signature valid\n  (:issue:`#3323`)\n* (Windows) Use UTF-8 when reading XML manifest file. (:issue:`#3476`)\n* (Windows) utils/win32: trap invalid ``--icon`` arguments and terminate with a\n  message. (:issue:`#3126`)\n\n\nIncompatible Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Drop support for Python 3.3 (:issue:`#3288`), Thanks to Hugo and xiovat.\n* ``--debug`` now expects an (optional) argument. Thus using ``… --debug\n  script.py`` will break. Use ``… script.py --debug`` or ``… --debug=all\n  script.py`` instead. Also ``--debug=all`` (which is the default if no\n  argument is given) includes ``noarchive``, which will store all collected\n  Python files in the output directory instead of freezing them. Use\n  ``--debug=bootloader`` to get the former behavior. (:issue:`#3546`,\n  :issue:`#3585`, :issue:`#3587`)\n* (minor) Change naming of intermediate build files and the `warn` file. This\n  only effects 3rd-party tools (if any exists) relying on the names of these\n  files.\n* (minor) The destination path for `--add-data` and `--add-binary` must no\n  longer be empty, use ``.`` instead. (:issue:`#3066`)\n* (minor) Use standard path, not dotted path, for C extensions (Python 3 only).\n\n\nHooks\n~~~~~\n\n* New hooks for bokeh visualization library (:issue:`#3607`),\n  Champlain, Clutter (:issue:`#3443`) dynaconf (:issue:`#3641`), flex\n  (:issue:`#3401`), FMPy (:issue:`#3589`), gi.repository.xlib\n  (:issue:`#2634`, :issue:`#3396`) google-cloud-translate,\n  google-api-core (:issue:`#3658`), jedi (:issue:`#3535`,\n  :issue:`#3612`), nltk (:issue:`#3705`), pandas (:issue:`#2978`,\n  :issue:`#2998`, :issue:`#2999`, :issue:`#3015`, :issue:`#3063`,\n  :issue:`#3079`), phonenumbers (:issue:`#3381`, :issue:`#3558`),\n  pinyin (:issue:`#2822`), PySide.phonon, PySide.QtSql\n  (:issue:`#2859`), pytorch (:issue:`#3657`), scipy (:issue:`#2987`,\n  :issue:`#3048`), uvloop (:issue:`#2898`), web3, eth_account,\n  eth_keyfile (:issue:`#3365`, :issue:`#3373`).\n\n* Updated hooks for Cryptodome 3.4.8, Django 2.1, gevent 1.3.\n  Crypto (support for PyCryptodome) (:issue:`#3424`),\n  Gst and GdkPixbuf (to work on msys2, :issue:`#3257`, :issue:`#3387`),\n  sphinx 1.7.1, setuptools 39.0.\n\n* Updated hooks for PyQt5 (:issue:`#1930`, :issue:`#1988`, :issue:`#2141`,\n  :issue:`#2156`, :issue:`#2220`, :issue:`#2518`, :issue:`#2566`,\n  :issue:`#2573`, :issue:`#2577`, :issue:`#2857`, :issue:`#2924`,\n  :issue:`#2976`, :issue:`#3175`, :issue:`#3211`, :issue:`#3233`,\n  :issue:`#3308`, :issue:`#3338`, :issue:`#3417`, :issue:`#3439`,\n  :issue:`#3458`, :issue:`#3505`), among others:\n  - All QML is now loaded by QtQml.QQmlEngine.\n  - Improve error reporting when determining the PyQt5 library location.\n  - Improved method for finding qt.conf.\n  - Include OpenGL fallback DLLs for PyQt5. (:issue:`#3568`).\n  - Place PyQt5 DLLs in the correct location (:issue:`#3583`).\n\n* Fix hooks for cryptodome (:issue:`#3405`),\n  PySide2 (style mismatch) (:issue:`#3374`, :issue:`#3578`)\n* Fix missing SSL libraries on Windows with PyQt5.QtNetwork. (:issue:`#3511`,\n  :issue:`#3520`)\n* Fix zmq on Windows Python 2.7. (:issue:`#2147`)\n* (GNU/Linux) Fix hook usb: Resolve library name reported by usb.backend.\n  (:issue:`#2633`, :issue:`#2831`, :issue:`#3269`)\n\n* Clean up the USB hook logic.\n\n\nBootloader\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Forward all signals to the child process if option\n  ``pyi-bootloader-ignore-signals`` to be set in the archive. (:issue:`#208`,\n  :issue:`#3515`)\n* Use waitpid instead of wait to avoid the bootloder parent process gets\n  signaled. (:issue:`#2966`)\n* (OS X) Don't make the application a GUI app by default, even in\n  `--windowed``-mode. Not enforcing this programmatically in the bootloader\n  allows to control behavior using ``Info.plist`` options - which can by set in\n  PyInstaller itself or in the `.spec`-file. (:issue:`#1917`, :issue:`#2075`,\n  :issue:`#3566`)\n* (Windows) Show respectivly print utf-8 debug messages ungarbled.\n  (:issue:`#3477`)\n* Fix ``setenv()`` call when HAVE_UNSETENV is not defined. (:issue:`#3722`,\n  :issue:`#3723`)\n\n\nModule Loader\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Improved error message in case importing an extension module fails.\n  (:issue:`#3017`)\n\n\nDocumentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Fix typos, smaller errors and formatting errors in documentation.\n  (:issue:`#3442`, :issue:`#3521`, :issue:`#3561`, :issue:`#3638`)\n* Make clear that ``--windowed`` is independent of ``--onedir``.\n  (:issue:`#3383`)\n* Mention imports using imports ``imp.find_module()`` are not detected.\n* Reflect actual behavior regarding LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (:issue:`#3236`)\n* (OS X) Revise section on ``info_plist`` for ``plistlib`` functionality and\n  use an example more aligned with real world usage. (:issue:`#3532`,\n  :issue:`#3540`, :issue:`#3541`)\n* (developers) Overhaul guidelines for commit and commit-messages.\n  (:issue:`#3466`)\n* (developers) Rework developer’s quick-start guide.\n\n\nProject & Process\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add a pip ``requirements.txt`` file.\n* Let `pyup` update package requirements for “Test – Libraries” every month\n  only.\n* Use `towncrier` to manage the change log entries. (:issue:`#2756`,\n  :issue:`#2837`, :issue:`#3698`)\n\n\nPyInstaller Core\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add ``requirements_for_package`` and ``collect_all`` helper functions for\n  hooks.\n* Add a explanatory header to the warn-file, hopefully reducing the number of\n  those posting the file to the issue tracker.\n* Add module ``'enum`` to base_library.zip, required for module ``re`` in\n  Python 3.6 (and ``re`` is required by ``warnings``).\n* Always write the `warn`-file.\n* Apply ``format_binaries_and_datas()`` (which converts hook-style tuples into\n  `TOC`-style tuples) to binaries and datas added through the hook api.\n* Avoid printing a useless exceptions in the ``get_module_file_attribute``\n  helper function..\n* Don't gather Python extensions in ``collect_dynamic_libc()``.\n* Fix several ResourceWarnings and DeprecationWarnings (:issue:`#3677`)\n* Hint users to install necessary development packages If in\n  ``format_binaries_and_datas()`` the file not found is ``pyconfig.h``.\n  (:issue:`#1539`, :issue:`#3348`)\n* Hook helper function ``is_module_satisfies()`` returns ``False`` for packages\n  not found. (:issue:`#3428`, :issue:`#3481`)\n* Read data for cache digest in chunks. (:issue:`#3281`)\n* Select correct file extension for C-extension file-names like\n  ``libzmq.cp36-win_amd64.pyd``.\n* State type of import (conditional, delayed, etc.) in the `warn`-file again.\n* (modulegraph) Unbundle `altgraph` library, use from upstream.\n  (:issue:`#3058`)\n* (OS X) In `console`-mode set ``LSBackgroundOnly=True`` in``Info.plist`` to\n  hide the app-icon in the dock. This can still be overruled by passing\n  ``info_plist`` in the `.spec`-file. (:issue:`#1917`, :issue:`#3566`)\n* (OS X) Use the python standard library ``plistlib`` for generating the\n  ``Info.plist`` file. (:issue:`#3532`, :issue:`#3541`)\n* (Windows) Completely remove `pywin32` dependency, which has erratic releases\n  and the version on pypi may no longer have future releases. Require\n  `pywin32-ctypes` instead, which is pure python. (:issue:`#3141`)\n* (Windows) Encode manifest before updating resource. (:issue:`#3423`)\n* (Windows) Make import compatible with python.net, which uses an incompatible\n  signature for ``__import__``. (:issue:`#3574`)\n\n\nTest-suite and Continuous Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add script and dockerfile for running tests in docker. (contributed, not\n  maintained) (:issue:`#3519`)\n* Avoid log messages to be written (and captured) twice.\n* Fix decorator ``skipif_no_compiler``.\n* Fix the test for the “W” run-time Python option to verify module ``warnings``\n  can actually be imported. (:issue:`#3402`, :issue:`#3406`)\n* Fix unicode errors when not capturing output by pytest.\n* Run pyinstaller -h to verify it works.\n* ``test_setuptools_nspkg`` no longer modifies source files.\n\n* Appveyor:\n\n  - Add documentation for Appveyor variables used to ``appveyor.yml``.\n  - Significantly clean-up appveyor.yml (:issue:`#3107`)\n  - Additional tests produce > 1 hour runs. Split each job into two\n    jobs.\n  - Appveyor tests run on 2 cores; therefore, run 2 jobs in parallel.\n  - Reduce disk usage.\n  - Split Python 2.7 tests into two jobs to avoid the 1 hour limit.\n  - Update to use Windows Server 2016. (:issue:`#3563`)\n\n* Travis\n\n  - Use build-stages.\n  - Clean-up travis.yml (:issue:`#3108`)\n  - Fix Python installation on OS X. (:issue:`#3361`)\n  - Start a X11 server for the \"Test - Libraries\" stage only.\n  - Use target python interpreter to compile bootloader to check if the\n    build tool can be used with that this Python version.\n\n\nBootloader build\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Print invoking python version when compiling.\n* Update `waf` build-tool to 2.0.9 and fix our ``wscript`` for `waf` 2.0.\n* (GNU/Linux) When building with ``--debug`` turn of FORTIFY_SOURCE to ease\n  debugging.\n\n\n.. _v3.4 known issues:\n\nKnown Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Anaconda's PyQt5 packages are not supported\n  because its ``QlibraryInfo`` implementation reports incorrect values.\n\n* All scripts frozen into the package, as well as all run-time hooks, share\n  the same global variables. This issue exists since v3.2 but was discovered\n  only lately, see :issue:`3037`. This may lead to leaking global variables\n  from run-time hooks into the script and from one script to subsequent ones.\n  It should have effects in rare cases only, though.\n\n* Data-files from wheels, unzipped eggs or not ad egg at all are not included\n  automatically. This can be worked around using a hook-file, but may not\n  suffice when using ``--onefile`` and something like `python-daemon`.\n\n* The multipackage (MERGE) feature (:issue:`1527`) is currently broken.\n\n* (OSX) Support for OpenDocument events (:issue:`1309`) is broken.\n\n* (Windows) With Python 2.7 the frozen application may not run if the\n  user-name (more specifically ``%TEMPDIR%``) includes some Unicode\n  characters. This does not happen with all Unicode characters, but only some\n  and seems to be a windows bug. As a work-around please upgrade to Python 3\n  (:issue:`2754`, :issue:`2767`).\n\n* (Windows) For Python >= 3.5 targeting *Windows < 10*, the developer needs to\n  take special care to include the Visual C++ run-time .dlls. Please see the\n  section :ref:`Platform-specific Notes <Platform-specific Notes - Windows>`\n  in the manual. (:issue:`1566`)\n\n\n3.3.1 (2017-12-13)\n------------------\n\nHooks\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Fix imports in hooks accessible_output and sound_lib (#2860).\n* Fix ImportError for sysconfig for 3.5.4 Conda (#3105, #3106).\n* Fix shapely hook for conda environments on Windows (#2838).\n* Add hook for unidecode.\n\nBootloader\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* (Windows) Pre-build bootloaders (and custom-build ones using MSVC) can be\n  used on Windows XP again. Set minimum target OS to XP (#2974).\n\nBootloader build\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Fix build for FreeBSD (#2861, #2862).\n\nPyInstaller Core\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Usage: Add help-message clarifying use of options when a spec-file is\n  provided (#3039).\n\n* Add printing infos on UnicodeDecodeError in exec_command(_all).\n* (win32) Issue an error message on errors loading the icon file (#2039).\n* (aarch64) Use correct bootloader for 64-bit ARM (#2873).\n* (OS X) Fix replacement of run-time search path keywords (``@…`` ) (#3100).\n\n* Modulegraph\n\n  * Fix recursion too deep errors cause by reimporting SWIG-like modules\n    (#2911, #3040, #3061).\n  * Keep order of imported identifiers.\n\n\nTest-suite and Continuous Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* In Continuous Integration tests: Enable flake8-diff linting. This will\n  refuse all changed lines not following PEP 8.\n\n* Enable parallel testing on Windows,\n* Update requirements.\n* Add more test cases for modulegraph.\n* Fix a test-case for order of module import.\n\n* Add test-cases to check scripts do not share the same global vars (see\n  :ref:`v3.3.1 known issues`).\n\nDocumentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add clarification about treatment of options when a spec-file is provided\n  (#3039).\n* Add docs for running PyInstaller with Python optimizations (#2905).\n\n* Add notes about limitations of Cython support.\n* Add information how to handle undetected ctypes libraries.\n* Add notes about requirements and restrictions of SWIG support.\n* Add note to clarify what `binary files` are.\n\n* Add a Development Guide.\n* Extend \"How to Contribute\".\n* Add \"Running the Test Suite\".\n\n* Remove badges from the Readme (#2853).\n\n* Update outdated sections in man-pages and otehr enhancements to the\n  man-page.\n\n\n.. _v3.3.1 known issues:\n\nKnown Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* All scripts frozen into the package, as well as all run-time hooks, share\n  the same global variables. This issue exists since v3.2 but was discovered\n  only lately, see :issue:`3037`. This may lead to leaking global variables\n  from run-time hooks into the script and from one script to subsequent ones.\n  It should have effects in rare cases only, though.\n\n* Further see the :ref:`Known Issues for release 3.3 <v3.3 known issues>`.\n\n\n3.3 (2017-09-21)\n----------------\n\n* **Add Support for Python 3.6!** Many thanks to xiovat! (#2331, #2341)\n\n* New command line options for adding data files (``--datas``, #1990) and\n  binaries (``--binaries``, #703)\n\n* Add command line option '--runtime-tmpdir'.\n\n* Bootloaders for Windows are now build using MSVC and statically linked with\n  the run-time-library (CRT). This solved a lot of issues related to .dlls\n  being incompatible with the ones required by ``python.dll``.\n\n* Bootloaders for GNU/Linux are now officially no LSB binaries. This was\n  already the case since release 3.1, but documented the other way round. Also\n  the build defaults to non-LSB binaries now. (#2369)\n\n* We improved and stabilized both building the bootloaders and the continuous\n  integration tests. See below for details. Many thanks to all who worked on\n  this.\n\n* To ease solving issues with packages included wrongly, the html-file with a\n  cross-reference is now always generated. It's visual appearance has been\n  modernized (#2765).\n\nIncompatible changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Command-line option obsoleted several version ago are not longer handled\n  gracefully but raise an error (#2413)\n\n* Installation: PyInstaller removed some internal copies of 3rd-party\n  packages. These are now taken from their official releases at PyPI (#2589).\n  This results in PyInstaller to no longer can be used from just an unpacked\n  archive, but needs to be installed like any Python package. This should\n  effect only a few people, e.g. the developers.\n\n* Following :pep:`527`, we only release one source archive now and decided to\n  use `.tar.gz` (#2754).\n\nHooks\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* New and Updated hooks: accessible_output2 (#2266), ADIOS (#2096), CherryPy\n  (#2112), PySide2 (#2471, #2744) (#2472), Sphinx (#2612, 2708) (#2708),\n  appdir (#2478), clr (#2048), cryptodome (#2125), cryptography (#2013), dclab\n  (#2657), django (#2037), django migrations (#1795), django.contrib (#2336),\n  google.cloud, google.cloud.storage, gstreamer (#2603), imageio (#2696),\n  langcodes (#2682), libaudioverse (#2709), mpl_toolkits (#2400), numba,\n  llvmlite (#2113), openpyxl (#2066), pylint, pymssql, pyopencl, pyproj\n  (#2677), pytest (#2119), qtawesome (#2617), redmine, requests (#2334),\n  setuptools, setuptools (#2565), shapely (#2569), sound_lib (#2267),\n  sysconfig, uniseg (#2683), urllib3, wx.rc (#2295),\n\n  * numpy: Look for .dylib libraries, too ( (#2544), support numpy MKL builds\n    (#1881, #2111)\n\n  * osgeo: Add conda specific places to check for auxiliary data (#2401)\n\n  * QT and related\n\n    - Add hooks for PySide2\n    - Eliminate run-time hook by placing files in the correct directory\n    - Fix path in homebrew for searching for qmake (#2354)\n    - Repair Qt dll location  (#2403)\n    - Bundle PyQT 5.7 DLLs (#2152)\n    - PyQt5: Return qml plugin path including subdirectory (#2694)\n    - Fix hooks for PyQt5.QtQuick (#2743)\n    - PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets: Include files needed by QWebEngine\n\n  * GKT+ and related\n\n    - Fix Gir file path on windows.\n    - Fix unnecessary file search & generation when GI's typelib is exists\n    - gi: change gir search path when running from a virtualenv\n    - gi: package gdk-pixbuf in osx codesign agnostic dir\n    - gi: rewrite the GdkPixbuf loader cache at runtime on Linux\n    - gi: support onefile mode for GdkPixbuf\n    - gi: support using gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-64 when present\n    - gi: GIR files are only required on OSX\n    - gio: copy the mime.cache also\n    - Fix hooks for PyGObject on windows platform (#2306)\n\n* Fixed hooks: botocore (#2384), clr (#1801), gstreamer (#2417), h5py\n  (#2686), pylint, Tix data files (#1660), usb.core (#2088), win32com on\n  non-windows-systems (#2479)\n\n* Fix ``multiprocess`` spawn mode on POSIX OSs (#2322, #2505, #2759, #2795).\n\nBootloader\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add `tempdir` option to control where bootloader will extract files (#2221)\n* (Windows) in releases posted on PyPI requires msvcr*.dll (#2343)\n* Fix unsafe string manipulation, resource and memory leaks.

This can be worked around using a hook-file, but may not\n  suffice when using ``--onefile`` and something like `python-daemon`.\n\n* The multipackage (MERGE) feature (#1527) is currently broken.\n\n* (OSX) Support for OpenDocument events (#1309) is broken.\n\n* (Windows) With Python 2.7 the frozen application may not run if the\n  user-name (more specifically ``%TEMPDIR%``) includes some Unicode\n  characters. This does not happen with all Unicode characters, but only some\n  and seems to be a windows bug. As a work-around please upgrade to Python 3\n  (#2754, #2767).\n\n* (Windows) For Python >= 3.5 targeting *Windows < 10*, the developer needs to\n  take special care to include the Visual C++ run-time .dlls. Please see the\n  section :ref:`Platform-specific Notes <Platform-specific Notes - Windows>`\n  in the manual. (#1566)\n\n* For Python 3.3, imports are not thread-safe (#2371#). Since Python 3.3 is\n  end of live at 2017-09-29, we are not going to fix this.",
