    "description": "ServiceCreator\r\n==============\r\n\r\nCreate init.d services at your Debian-based distribution easily with\r\nthis automatic tool.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis tool will allow you to *easily create* **init.d** scripts\r\n(*functions that will start on computer boot*) on your Debian based\r\ndistributions (such as **Ubuntu**, **Raspbian**, etc).\r\n\r\nThe functionality of this tool is simple: *ask the user for some\r\ninformation about the service and create it with no more user\r\ninteraction*.\r\n\r\nThe tool works as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Ask for service folder** if not found: the script will try to\r\n   search *\"/etc/init.d/\"* folder. If not found, then will request user\r\n   for giving a **new folder** where scripts are installed.\r\n\r\n2. **Request a service name**, which is necessary for installation. If\r\n   the provided service name exists, a *new name for the service will be\r\n   asked* (as **there can not be two services** with the same name).\r\n\r\n3. **Ask for a command** that will execute your service. At this option,\r\n   you are able to **load the command** from a file (if the command you\r\n   would like to add has multiple lines) If load option is chosen, the\r\n   file *will be modified* and stored in *\"/usr/local/bin/\"* in order to\r\n   be able to execute \\| see `\"Why\r\n   root?\" <https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator#why-root>`__\r\n\r\n4. **Request a short and a long description** for the service. The\r\n   installation and execution process needs, at least, a *short\r\n   description*, and not necessary a long description. If you do not\r\n   specify the long one, it will be a copy of the short description.\r\n\r\n5. **Install and register** the service into the system. For this\r\n   process, the tool *copies* and *registers* the new script into the\r\n   system, and enables it for running on boot.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about that services and process, see *`\"Why\r\nroot?\" <https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator#why-root>`__*\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYou have some methods in order to install this tool (all need *root\r\naccess - get it by typing ``su`` or using ``sudo``*):\r\n\r\n-  Using ``pip``:\r\n\r\n   If you only have Python 3 installed:\r\n\r\n   .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n       pip install ServiceCreator\r\n       # If \"pip\" not found:\r\n       pip3 install ServiceCreator\r\n       # If none of the above works:\r\n       python3 -m pip install ServiceCreator \r\n       # If \"python3\" not present, try with \"python\"\r\n       python -m pip install ServiceCreator\r\n\r\n   If the above commands *are not present on your system*:\r\n\r\n   .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n       apt-get install pip3\r\n       # If Python 3 not installed\r\n       apt-get install python3 pip3\r\n\r\n   Then run the commands listed with ``pip``\r\n-  Using the ``setup.py`` method:\r\n\r\n   -  First, **download the file**:\r\n\r\n      (Using ``wget`` and ``unzip``):\r\n\r\n      .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n          wget https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator/archive/master.zip\r\n          unzip master.zip\r\n          cd master/\r\n\r\n      If the above commands *are not present on your system*:\r\n\r\n      .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n          apt-get install wget unzip\r\n\r\n      (Using ``git``):\r\n\r\n      .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n          git clone https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator.git\r\n          cd ServiceCreator/\r\n\r\n      If the above commands *are not present on your system*:\r\n\r\n      .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n          apt-get install git\r\n\r\n   -  Then, **install it** to your system:\r\n      ``bash     python3 setup.py install     # If the above does not work     python setup.py install``\r\n      If *commands not found*, you must install ``Python 3`` on your\r\n      system: ``bash     apt-get install python3``\r\n\r\nThis will install **the application** and **all its dependencies** to\r\nyour system.\r\n\r\nHow to update\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAs in the `installation\r\nmethod <https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator#how-to-install>`__,\r\nto update you have two options:\r\n\r\n1. If you installed via ``pip``:\r\n   ``bash     pip install -U ServiceCreator     # If \"pip\" not found:     pip3 install -U ServiceCreator     # If none of the above works:     python3 -m pip -U install ServiceCreator      # If \"python3\" not present, try with \"python\"     python -m pip -U install ServiceCreator``\r\n\r\n2. If you installed via ``setup.py``:\r\n\r\n   First, you have to *download the new version available* following the\r\n   steps described at the *`installation\r\n   method. <https://github.com/Javinator9889/ServiceCreator#how-to-install>`__*\r\n\r\n   Then, what you have to do is:\r\n\r\n   .. code:: bash\r\n\r\n       python setup.py install\r\n       # If the above does not work\r\n       python3 setup.py install\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nOnce the application *is installed on your system*, you will be able to\r\nrun it by typing the following command:\r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n    service_creator \r\n    # or with sudo\r\n    sudo service_creator\r\n\r\nWhy root?\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis application requires root for the following commands: \\* In\r\n***/usr/local/bin/*** for creating an executable file. If not, you can\r\ncreate that file by yourself with:\r\n``bash     nano your_script.sh     # Add your config here     chmod +x your_script.sh     sudo mv your_script.sh /usr/local/bin/your_script.sh``\r\n\\* In ***/etc/init.d/*** for moving your created service and registering\r\nit for running on boot. To perform this manually:\r\n``bash     service_creator -e /home/YOUR_USER/your_script.sh     # Create your service     sudo mv /home/YOUR_USER/your_script.sh /etc/init.d/your_script.sh     sudo update-rc.d your_script.sh defaults``\r\n\r\nAlso you can give the application *root* permissions so it will be able\r\nto do that by itself.\r\n\r\nI found an error or I want to contribute\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI would *love* to see how my application grows up, so feel free to\r\ncreate your **own version** of this app. Just *fork it* and make all the\r\nchanges you want üòÑ\r\n\r\nAlso if you want to *add a new functionality* or *solve a bug*, you are\r\nfree to open a **pull request** so I can merge the changes you have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHow can I help?\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n-  Feel free to *follow me at GitHub* üë•: I create a lot of projects and\r\n   maybe you find someone interesting.\r\n-  *Start* ‚≠ê this project if you find it helpful üòÑ\r\n-  *Share it* with the people you think they will find interesting my\r\n   job üó£\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis project is under *GNU General Public License v3.0*.
