    "description": "# Python State Machines\nThis is an extremely small and new library I wrote to help manage state machines in classes in Python.\n\n## Inspiration\nThis library was inspired by [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1Mzx_tSpew). I found the concept very fascinating, as I have run into this problem many times, but I also found the syntax clunky. \nOne of the nice things about Python is its dynamism. This can be a real struggle when size and complexity grows, but it at least\nallows for very nice, often magical feeling, syntax around a lot of things. Naturally, rather than passing large, *in situ* lists and dictionaries, I thought it would be \nnicer to employ dictionaries, and some inference to make the code more pleasant and (hopefully) more self-documenting\n\n## Find on pypi\n\nThis project uses [this template](https://github.com/fastai/pypi_template) to create a pypi package. \n\nYou can find the project [here](https://pypi.org/project/statemachine-elunico/) and install it using `pip install statemachine-elunico` and then import it with `import statemachine`\n\n## Explanation \nThe library consists of 3 main items: `Machine`, `MachineError`, and `allows_access`.\n\n`Machine` is a decorator that provides a class with the logic needed to implement a finite state machine. \nThis class can then be used to guard access to particular\nmethods in *your* class without you having to write any `if` based logic.\nThis allows all the business logic of your program to live in the methods you write unclutters, \nwhile still allowing a robust state management system  to exist around method calls in your class. \nThe logic for handling the state checking and changing is done by the `Machine` while you add a simple \ndeclarative decorator statement to the methods you want checked when defining them. \nWatching the talk given in the above link and looking at the example file might be a good way of getting a feel for how this works. \n\n\n### Explanation through Example\n\nBriefly, imagine you have a music player that be be started, stopped, and paused and so has the methods `start`, `stop`, and `pause`.\nYou want to be able to pause while started but not stopped. You want to be able to stop while either started, paused, or stopped. Finally,\nyou want to be able to start while stopped or paused. You begin in the stopped state.\n\nImmediately, you might be able to see there is a fair bit going on, and we only have 3 states and a few rules. \nYou can imagine how much more complex this might get if we have more options for states and the ways of moving between them.\nIn order to implement these rules, we could imagine a `Player` class with a source URL for the video it will play and \nseveral booleans for state. It would be the task of the creator of the `Player` class, then, to maintain the proper state \nof all these booleans and to ensure they are correctly checked and updated in every method. Once again, I will point\nto the talk in the link I included for an idea of what this looks like (spoiler alert: it is not pretty)\n\nThis is where this library comes in. Rather than focus on the state management and checking, we leave that \nto the `Machine` class. It can take care of changing state and all the management and checking needed (mostly, \nmore on that in a bit)\n\nWe simply use the `@Machine` annotation and then write our `Player` class\ncompletely normally. We must also specify what our initial state will be. This will be true for every instance of a class\n\n```python \n@Machine(init_state='stop')\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, src: str):\n        self.src = src\n\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n        # business logic to start playing\n\n    def stop(self):\n        ...\n        # business logic to stop playing\n\n    def pause(self):\n        ... \n        # business logic to pause playing\n```\n\n### Important Note\n\nLet me point out several things before we continue: 1) the use of strings is a deliberate, but noteworthy choice. It is critical that you specify States \nto the machine as strings, however these strings must **exactly** match the names of methods which trigger those states in your class.\nFor example, here, the initial state is called 'stop' because the state 'stop' is always triggered by calling the `stop` method. \nWe could not call this state 'stopped' unless we also called the method `stopped`. Doing it this way (while risky) **greatly** simplifies the code \nneeded to implement and maintain. Because more time will be spent using the methods than the states themselves (since the `Machine` manages state logic)\nI recommend you write methods as normal and have grammatically dubious state names rather than the other way around.\n### ---\n\nThere is still something missing from this example. While we have created the machine and defined the initial state, we are\ncurrently not guarding access to the methods of the class in any way. \nUsing this library allows you to have unlimited methods that do not interact or pay any attention to the \nstate machine. The state machine will only protect access to calling methods on which you have explicitly chosen \nto define limitations. \n\nThese limitations are defined using the `allows_access` decorator. You \nadd this decorator to the methods on the class which interact with the state machine. \nIt accepts 1 keyword argument: an iterable of strings (`Iterable[str]`).\nThese strings **must exactly match the names of the states which are valid _source_ states for the particular method\nbeing called**. What does this mean? Put simply, you define the states *from which* it is legal to transition \nto the state indicated by your method. Once again, the *names of methods* are used to indicate the destination\nstate and are used to set the current state after a method call. Therefore, it is important that you correctly name\nthe methods in the decorator. We will now see the class example from above, but fully written out to implement \nthe state checking logic described in the beginning of the article. \n\nNote that because you are only passing strings into the decorators, it is trivially easy to allow transitions \nto the state being defined by the method by simply including the name of the method in the list of valid 'from states'\n\n```python\n@Machine(init_state='stop')\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, video):\n        self.video = video\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'stop'])\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start'])\n    def pause(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start', 'pause', 'stop'])\n    def stop(self):\n        ...\n```\n\nImagine now we create a `Player` object. This object begins in the 'stop' state. We may only call `start` from the \n'stop' state, as it is the only method whose `from_states` list includes 'stop'. Calling the `start` method \nwill not only check to make sure we are in an acceptable state, but it will also transition the Machine to the \n'start' state, meaning it is no longer valid to call `start` but is valid to call `pause` and `stop` \n\nIn the event that a method call cannot be executed due to the state machine's current state, then a `MachineError`\nis raised and **the current state of the machine is unchanged**\n\nThe library also allows you to define a `to_states` parameter. This allows you to define the states that can be \n*transitioned to* from a paritcular method/state rather than transitioned from. You can also mix and match these\nas you like in the same decorator, but **do not double up `allows_access` decorators on 1 method.\n\nHere is another way of implementing the same logic above\n\n```python\n@Machine(init_state='stop')\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, video):\n        self.video = video\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'stop'], to_states=['pause'])\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(to_states=['start', 'stop'])\n    def pause(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start', 'pause', 'stop'])\n    def stop(self):\n        ...\n```\n\nYou do not have to provide both `from_states` and `to_states`. It is possible to define every transition using only \n1 of these keyword arguments. Both exist simply to make it easier to express the most natural description of the \ndomain. \n\nAlso that any combination of parameters will be used and the transitions between states are the union of all the \nspecified states in all decorators in order of execution. Therefore, there is no precedence. Any rule \nspecified in any decorator will have the same effect and there is no preference or priorty to the `from_states` or `two_states` parameter\n\n**There are no protections in place if you make a state that is inescapable or one that can never be reached. \nNote that if you do not decorate a method it will always be callable, but if it is decorated there are no checks for \nislands or cycles or deadends, that is up to you**\n\n### Extending this example \nAside from the declarative nature of this system and the ability to keep state checking logic out of the way of business\nlogic, this library really demonstrates its usefulness when adding additional states and functionality. \n\nLet's say we want to extend the above example to include the ability to rewind. We will want to add some `rewind()`\nmethod with the necessary business logic (not shown) to perform the rewind. But we also have to make sure we are in an \nacceptable state before calling rewind. We are able to `rewind` if we are in the 'pause' state or the 'start' state.\nFurthermore, we are able to go to the 'pause', 'start', and 'stop', state if in the 'rewind' state. \n\nThere are two ways we can implement this change. The first way is to use the same `from_states` parameter on \n`allows_acces` and retroactively add states to the existing methods, keeping everything consistent. \n\n```python\n@Machine(init_state='stop')\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, video):\n        self.video = video\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'stop', 'rewind'])\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start', 'rewind'])\n    def pause(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start', 'pause', 'stop', 'rewind'])\n    def stop(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'start'])\n    def rewind(self):\n        ...\n```\n\nThis has the advantage of remaining consitent. It also can work by adding the business logic for the new state in the \nmethod and asking, \"in what states can I peform this action?\" and filling in the values accordingly. Then, \nvisit every method and ask \"can I do this, if I am currently in state X\" where X is the new state that is being added.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to only add information to the program and leave the other states untouched. This will work\nprogrammatically, but it has the disadvantage of obfuscating the nice declarative nature of the decorators. You can \nno longer see exactly which states go to a state above the method declaration.\n\n```python\n@Machine(init_state='stop')\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, video):\n        self.video = video\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'stop'])\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start'])\n    def pause(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['start', 'pause', 'stop'])\n    def stop(self):\n        ...\n\n    @allows_access(from_states=['pause', 'start'], to_states=['start', 'pause', 'stop'])\n    def rewind(self):\n        ...\n```\n\nThe way a new state is implemented is up to you. Either will work equally well in terms of the implementation of the `Machine`\n\nWhile it is true that it is less clear to read in source when using a mix of `from_states` and `to_states`, you can interrogate instances the class being managed\n(in this case `Player`) to determine the allowed states for transition to and from other states. \n\n### Determining all Transitions To and From a State\n\nYou can interrogate the machine to find out what methods are valid \n'to' states and valid 'from' states for a given state. When using the `@Machine` decorator\na method called `get_all_states` is injected into your decorated class. This method accepts a single `str` argument which is the \nname of the state/method you are interested in. It returns a `dict` object with two keys: the 'from_states' key \nmaps to a set of strings that are all the states you may transition to the given state from and the 'to_states' \nkey which maps to a set of all the valid next states for that state. \n\nYou can say something like\n\n```python\np = Player()\np.get_all_states('start') \n# returns { 'to_states': {'pause', 'stop', 'rewind'}, \n#           'from_states': {'pause', 'stop', 'rewind'} }\n```\n\n## Wrapping up \n\nI believe this implementation is elegant, concise, declarative, and easy to use. The library\nis very young and new, and I am currently the only person maintaining it. If you find any bugs \nor issues or features that would be useful that are not present, please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md`\ndocument and open an issue or a pull request. \n\n",
