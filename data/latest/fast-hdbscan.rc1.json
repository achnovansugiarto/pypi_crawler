The algorithm runs in parallel and can make\neffective use of as many cores as you wish to throw at a problem. It is thus ideal for large SMP systems, and even\nmodern multicore laptops.\n\nThis library provides a\nre-implementation of a subset of the HDBSCAN algorithm that is compatible with the\n`hdbscan <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan>`_ library for data that is Euclidean and\nlow dimensional. The primary advantages of this library over the standard ``hdbscan`` library are:\n\n\n * this library can easily use all available cores to speed up computation;\n * this library has much faster implementations of tree condensing and cluster extraction;\n * this library is much simpler and more approachable for extending or using components from;\n * this library is built on numba and has less issues with binaries and compilation.\n\nThis library does not support all the features and input formats available in the hdbscan library.\n\n-----------\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nThe ``fast_hdbscan`` library follows the ``hdbscan`` library in using the sklearn API. You can use the ``fast_hdbscan``\nclass ``HDBSCAN`` exactly as you wuld that of the ``hdbscan`` library with the caveat that ``fast_hdbscan`` only\nsupports a subset of the parameters and options of ``hdbscan``. Nonetheless, if you have low-dimensional\nEuclidean data (e.g. the output of UMAP), you can use this library as a straightforward drop in replacement for\n``hdbscan``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import fast_hdbscan\n    from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\n    data, _ = make_blobs(1000)\n\n    clusterer = fast_hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=10)\n    cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(data)\n\n------------\nInstallation\n------------\nfast_hdbscan requires:\n\n * numba\n * numpy\n * scikit-learn\n\nfast_hdbscan can be installed via pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install fast-hdbscan\n\nTo manually install this package:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    wget https://github.com/TutteInstitute/fast_hdbscan/archive/main.zip\n    unzip main.zip\n    rm main.zip\n    cd fast_hdbscan-main\n    python setup.py install\n\n----------\nReferences\n----------\n\nThe algorithm used here is an adaptation of the algorithms described in the papers:\n\n    McInnes L, Healy J. *Accelerated Hierarchical Density Based Clustering*\n    In: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), IEEE, pp 33-42.\n    2017 `[pdf] <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215642>`_\n\n    R.
