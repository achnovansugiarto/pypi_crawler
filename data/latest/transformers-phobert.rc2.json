1.0.0+ (PyTorch 1.3.1+ for examples) and TensorFlow 2.0.\n\nYou should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n\nCreate a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.\n\nNow, if you want to use 🤗 Transformers, you can install it with pip. If you'd like to play with the examples, you must install it from source.\n\n### With pip\n\nFirst you need to install one of, or both, TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#tensorflow-2.0-rc-is-available) and/or [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) regarding the specific install command for your platform.\n\nWhen TensorFlow 2.0 and/or PyTorch has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers-phobert\n```\n\n### From source\n\nHere also, you first need to install one of, or both, TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#tensorflow-2.0-rc-is-available) and/or [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) regarding the specific install command for your platform.\n\nWhen TensorFlow 2.0 and/or PyTorch has been installed, you can install from source by cloning the repository and running:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\ncd transformers\npip install .\n```\n\nWhen you update the repository, you should upgrade the transformers installation and its dependencies as follows:\n\n```bash\ngit pull\npip install --upgrade .\n```\n\n### Run the examples\n\nExamples are included in the repository but are not shipped with the library.\n\nTherefore, in order to run the latest versions of the examples, you need to install from source, as described above.\n\nLook at the [README](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/README.md) for how to run examples.\n\n### Tests\n\nA series of tests are included for the library and for some example scripts. Library tests can be found in the [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/tests) and examples tests in the [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples).\n\nDepending on which framework is installed (TensorFlow 2.0 and/or PyTorch), the irrelevant tests will be skipped. Ensure that both frameworks are installed if you want to execute all tests.\n\nHere's the easiest way to run tests for the library:\n\n```bash\npip install -e \".[testing]\"\nmake test\n```\n\nand for the examples:\n\n```bash\npip install -e \".[testing]\"\npip install -r examples/requirements.txt\nmake test-examples\n```\n\nFor details, refer to the [contributing guide](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests).\n\n### Do you want to run a Transformer model on a mobile device?\n\nYou should check out our [`swift-coreml-transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-transformers) repo.\n\nIt contains a set of tools to convert PyTorch or TensorFlow 2.0 trained Transformer models (currently contains `GPT-2`, `DistilGPT-2`, `BERT`, and `DistilBERT`) to CoreML models that run on iOS devices.\n\nAt some point in the future, you'll be able to seamlessly move from pre-training or fine-tuning models to productizing them in CoreML, or prototype a model or an app in CoreML then research its hyperparameters or architecture from TensorFlow 2.0 and/or PyTorch.

trained in 12 lines of code with 🤗 Transformers and then loaded in PyTorch for fast inspection/tests.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_datasets\nfrom transformers import *\n\n# Load dataset, tokenizer, model from pretrained model/vocabulary\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')\nmodel = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')\ndata = tensorflow_datasets.load('glue/mrpc')\n\n# Prepare dataset for GLUE as a tf.data.Dataset instance\ntrain_dataset = glue_convert_examples_to_features(data['train'], tokenizer, max_length=128, task='mrpc')\nvalid_dataset = glue_convert_examples_to_features(data['validation'], tokenizer, max_length=128, task='mrpc')\ntrain_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(100).batch(32).repeat(2)\nvalid_dataset = valid_dataset.batch(64)\n\n# Prepare training: Compile tf.keras model with optimizer, loss and learning rate schedule\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=3e-5, epsilon=1e-08, clipnorm=1.0)\nloss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\nmetric = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy('accuracy')\nmodel.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=[metric])\n\n# Train and evaluate using tf.keras.Model.fit()\nhistory = model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=2, steps_per_epoch=115,\n                    validation_data=valid_dataset, validation_steps=7)\n\n# Load the TensorFlow model in PyTorch for inspection\nmodel.save_pretrained('./save/')\npytorch_model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./save/', from_tf=True)\n\n# Quickly test a few predictions - MRPC is a paraphrasing task, let's see if our model learned the task\nsentence_0 = \"This research was consistent with his findings.\"\nsentence_1 = \"His findings were compatible with this research.\"\nsentence_2 = \"His findings were not compatible with this research.\"\ninputs_1 = tokenizer(sentence_0, sentence_1, add_special_tokens=True, return_tensors='pt')\ninputs_2 = tokenizer(sentence_0, sentence_2, add_special_tokens=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\npred_1 = pytorch_model(inputs_1['input_ids'], token_type_ids=inputs_1['token_type_ids'])[0].argmax().item()\npred_2 = pytorch_model(inputs_2['input_ids'], token_type_ids=inputs_2['token_type_ids'])[0].argmax().item()\n\nprint(\"sentence_1 is\", \"a paraphrase\" if pred_1 else \"not a paraphrase\", \"of sentence_0\")\nprint(\"sentence_2 is\", \"a paraphrase\" if pred_2 else \"not a paraphrase\", \"of sentence_0\")\n```\n\n## Quick tour of the fine-tuning/usage scripts\n\n**Important**\nBefore running the fine-tuning scripts, please read the\n[instructions](#run-the-examples) on how to\nsetup your environment to run the examples.\n\nThe library comprises several example scripts with SOTA performances for NLU and NLG tasks:\n\n- `run_glue.py`: an example fine-tuning sequence classification models on nine different GLUE tasks (*sequence-level classification*)\n- `run_squad.py`: an example fine-tuning question answering models on the question answering dataset SQuAD 2.0 (*token-level classification*)\n- `run_ner.py`: an example fine-tuning token classification models on named entity recognition (*token-level classification*)\n- `run_generation.py`: an example using GPT, GPT-2, CTRL, Transformer-XL and XLNet for conditional language generation\n- other model-specific examples (see the documentation).\n\nHere are three quick usage examples for these scripts:\n\n### `run_glue.py`: Fine-tuning on GLUE tasks for sequence classification\n\nThe [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/) is a collection of nine sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems.\n\nBefore running any of these GLUE tasks you should download the\n[GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running\n[this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e)\nand unpack it to some directory `$GLUE_DIR`.\n\nYou should also install the additional packages required by the examples:\n\n```shell\npip install -r ./examples/requirements.txt\n```\n\n```shell\nexport GLUE_DIR=/path/to/glue\nexport TASK_NAME=MRPC\n\npython ./examples/text-classification/run_glue.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \\\n    --task_name $TASK_NAME \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --do_eval \\\n    --data_dir $GLUE_DIR/$TASK_NAME \\\n    --max_seq_length 128 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size=8   \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size=8   \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3.0 \\\n    --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/\n```\n\nwhere task name can be one of CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, STS-B, QQP, MNLI, QNLI, RTE, WNLI.\n\nThe dev set results will be present within the text file 'eval_results.txt' in the specified output_dir. In case of MNLI, since there are two separate dev sets, matched and mismatched, there will be a separate output folder called '/tmp/MNLI-MM/' in addition to '/tmp/MNLI/'.\n\n#### Fine-tuning XLNet model on the STS-B regression task\n\nThis example code fine-tunes XLNet on the STS-B corpus using parallel training on a server with 4 V100 GPUs.\nParallel training is a simple way to use several GPUs (but is slower and less flexible than distributed training, see below).\n\n```shell\nexport GLUE_DIR=/path/to/glue\n\npython ./examples/text-classification/run_glue.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path xlnet-large-cased \\\n    --do_train  \\\n    --do_eval   \\\n    --task_name=sts-b     \\\n    --data_dir=${GLUE_DIR}/STS-B  \\\n    --output_dir=./proc_data/sts-b-110   \\\n    --max_seq_length=128   \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size=8   \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size=8   \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps=1 \\\n    --max_steps=1200  \\\n    --model_name=xlnet-large-cased   \\\n    --overwrite_output_dir   \\\n    --overwrite_cache \\\n    --warmup_steps=120\n```\n\nOn this machine we thus have a batch size of 32, please increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to reach the same batch size if you have a smaller machine. These hyper-parameters should result in a Pearson correlation coefficient of `+0.917` on the development set.\n\n#### Fine-tuning Bert model on the MRPC classification task\n\nThis example code fine-tunes the Bert Whole Word Masking model on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) corpus using distributed training on 8 V100 GPUs to reach a F1 > 92.\n\n```bash\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node 8 ./examples/text-classification/run_glue.py   \\\n    --model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking \\\n    --task_name MRPC \\\n    --do_train   \\\n    --do_eval   \\\n    --data_dir $GLUE_DIR/MRPC/   \\\n    --max_seq_length 128   \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size=8   \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size=8   \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5   \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3.0  \\\n    --output_dir /tmp/mrpc_output/ \\\n    --overwrite_output_dir   \\\n    --overwrite_cache \\\n```\n\nTraining with these hyper-parameters gave us the following results:\n\n```bash\n  acc = 0.8823529411764706\n  acc_and_f1 = 0.901702786377709\n  eval_loss = 0.3418912578906332\n  f1 = 0.9210526315789473\n  global_step = 174\n  loss = 0.07231863956341798\n```\n\n### `run_squad.py`: Fine-tuning on SQuAD for question-answering\n\nThis example code fine-tunes BERT on the SQuAD dataset using distributed training on 8 V100 GPUs and Bert Whole Word Masking uncased model to reach a F1 > 93 on SQuAD:\n\n```bash\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 ./examples/question-answering/run_squad.py \\\n    --model_type bert \\\n    --model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --do_eval \\\n    --train_file $SQUAD_DIR/train-v1.1.json \\\n    --predict_file $SQUAD_DIR/dev-v1.1.json \\\n    --learning_rate 3e-5 \\\n    --num_train_epochs 2 \\\n    --max_seq_length 384 \\\n    --doc_stride 128 \\\n    --output_dir ../models/wwm_uncased_finetuned_squad/ \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size=3   \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size=3   \\\n```\n\nTraining with these hyper-parameters gave us the following results:\n\n```bash\npython $SQUAD_DIR/evaluate-v1.1.py $SQUAD_DIR/dev-v1.1.json ../models/wwm_uncased_finetuned_squad/predictions.json\n{\"exact_match\": 86.91579943235573, \"f1\": 93.1532499015869}\n```\n\nThis is the model provided as `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad`.\n\n### `run_generation.py`: Text generation with GPT, GPT-2, CTRL, Transformer-XL and XLNet\n\nA conditional generation script is also included to generate text from a prompt.\nThe generation script includes the [tricks](https://github.com/rusiaaman/XLNet-gen#methodology) proposed by Aman Rusia to get high-quality generation with memory models like Transformer-XL and XLNet (include a predefined text to make short inputs longer).\n\nHere is how to run the script with the small version of OpenAI GPT-2 model:\n\n```shell\npython ./examples/text-generation/run_generation.py \\\n    --model_type=gpt2 \\\n    --length=20 \\\n    --model_name_or_path=gpt2 \\\n```\n\nand from the Salesforce CTRL model:\n```shell\npython ./examples/text-generation/run_generation.py \\\n    --model_type=ctrl \\\n    --length=20 \\\n    --model_name_or_path=ctrl \\\n    --temperature=0 \\\n    --repetition_penalty=1.2 \\\n```\n\n## Quick tour of model sharing\n\nStarting with `v2.2.2`, you can now upload and share your fine-tuned models with the community, using the <abbr title=\"Command-line interface\">CLI</abbr> that's built-in to the library.\n\n**First, create an account on [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)**. Optionally, join an existing organization or create a new one. Then:\n\n```shell\ntransformers-cli login\n# log in using the same credentials as on huggingface.co\n```\nUpload your model:\n```shell\ntransformers-cli upload ./path/to/pretrained_model/\n\n# ^^ Upload folder containing weights/tokenizer/config\n# saved via `.save_pretrained()`\n\ntransformers-cli upload ./config.json [--filename folder/foobar.json]\n\n# ^^ Upload a single file\n# (you can optionally override its filename, which can be nested inside a folder)\n```\n\nIf you want your model to be namespaced by your organization name rather than your username, add the following flag to any command:\n```shell\n--organization organization_name\n```\n\nYour model will then be accessible through its identifier, a concatenation of your username (or organization name) and the folder name above:\n```python\n\"username/pretrained_model\"\n# or if an org:\n\"organization_name/pretrained_model\"\n```\n\n**Please add a README.md model card** to the repo under `model_cards/` with: model description, training params (dataset, preprocessing, hardware used, hyperparameters), evaluation results, intended uses & limitations, etc.\n\nYour model now has a page on huggingface.co/models 🔥\n\nAnyone can load it from code:\n```python\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"namespace/pretrained_model\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"namespace/pretrained_model\")\n```\n\nList all your files on S3:\n```shell\ntransformers-cli s3 ls\n```\n\nYou can also delete unneeded files:\n\n```shell\ntransformers-cli s3 rm …\n```\n\n## Quick tour of pipelines\n\nNew in version `v2.3`: `Pipeline` are high-level objects which automatically handle tokenization, running your data through a transformers model\nand outputting the result in a structured object.\n\nYou can create `Pipeline` objects for the following down-stream tasks:\n\n - `feature-extraction`: Generates a tensor representation for the input sequence\n - `ner`: Generates named entity mapping for each word in the input sequence.\n - `sentiment-analysis`: Gives the polarity (positive / negative) of the whole input sequence.\n - `text-classification`: Initialize a `TextClassificationPipeline` directly, or see `sentiment-analysis` for an example.\n - `question-answering`: Provided some context and a question refering to the context, it will extract the answer to the question in the context.\n - `fill-mask`: Takes an input sequence containing a masked token (e.g. `<mask>`) and return list of most probable filled sequences, with their probabilities.\n - `summarization`\n - `translation_xx_to_yy`\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n>>> nlp = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n>>> nlp('We are very happy to include pipeline into the transformers repository.')\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9978193640708923}]\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for question-answering\n>>> nlp = pipeline('question-answering')\n>>> nlp({\n...     'question': 'What is the name of the repository ?',\n...     'context': 'Pipeline have been included in the huggingface/transformers repository'\n... })\n{'score': 0.5135612454720828, 'start': 35, 'end': 59, 'answer': 'huggingface/transformers'}\n\n```\n\n## Migrating from pytorch-transformers to transformers\n\nHere is a quick summary of what you should take care of when migrating from `pytorch-transformers` to `transformers`.\n\n### Positional order of some models' keywords inputs (`attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`...) changed\n\nTo be able to use Torchscript (see #1010, #1204 and #1195) the specific order of some models **keywords inputs** (`attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`...) has been changed.\n\nIf you used to call the models with keyword names for keyword arguments, e.g. `model(inputs_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, token_type_ids=token_type_ids)`, this should not cause any change.\n\nIf you used to call the models with positional inputs for keyword arguments, e.g. `model(inputs_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids)`, you may have to double check the exact order of input arguments.\n\n\n## Migrating from pytorch-pretrained-bert to transformers\n\nHere is a quick summary of what you should take care of when migrating from `pytorch-pretrained-bert` to `transformers`.\n\n### Models always output `tuples`\n\nThe main breaking change when migrating from `pytorch-pretrained-bert` to `transformers` is that every model's forward method always outputs a `tuple` with various elements depending on the model and the configuration parameters.\n\nThe exact content of the tuples for each model is detailed in the models' docstrings and the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).\n\nIn pretty much every case, you will be fine by taking the first element of the output as the output you previously used in `pytorch-pretrained-bert`.\n\nHere is a `pytorch-pretrained-bert` to `transformers` conversion example for a `BertForSequenceClassification` classification model:\n\n```python\n# Let's load our model\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\n# If you used to have this line in pytorch-pretrained-bert:\nloss = model(input_ids, labels=labels)\n\n# Now just use this line in transformers to extract the loss from the output tuple:\noutputs = model(input_ids, labels=labels)\nloss = outputs[0]\n\n# In transformers you can also have access to the logits:\nloss, logits = outputs[:2]\n\n# And even the attention weights if you configure the model to output them (and other outputs too, see the docstrings and documentation)\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', output_attentions=True)\noutputs = model(input_ids, labels=labels)\nloss, logits, attentions = outputs\n```\n\n### Using hidden states\n\nBy enabling the configuration option `output_hidden_states`, it was possible to retrieve the last hidden states of the encoder. In `pytorch-transformers` as well as `transformers` the return value has changed slightly: `all_hidden_states` now also includes the hidden state of the embeddings in addition to those of the encoding layers. This allows users to easily access the embeddings final state.\n\n### Serialization\n\nBreaking change in the `from_pretrained()` method:\n\n1. Models are now set in evaluation mode by default when instantiated with the `from_pretrained()` method. To train them, don't forget to set them back in training mode (`model.train()`) to activate the dropout modules.\n\n2. The additional `*input` and `**kwargs` arguments supplied to the `from_pretrained()` method used to be directly passed to the underlying model's class `__init__()` method. They are now used to update the model configuration attribute instead, which can break derived model classes built based on the previous `BertForSequenceClassification` examples. We are working on a way to mitigate this breaking change in [#866](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/866) by forwarding the model's `__init__()` method (i) the provided positional arguments and (ii) the keyword arguments which do not match any configuration class attributes.\n\nAlso, while not a breaking change, the serialization methods have been standardized and you probably should switch to the new method `save_pretrained(save_directory)` if you were using any other serialization method before.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\n### Let's load a model and tokenizer\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\n### Do some stuff to our model and tokenizer\n# Ex: add new tokens to the vocabulary and embeddings of our model\ntokenizer.add_tokens(['[SPECIAL_TOKEN_1]', '[SPECIAL_TOKEN_2]'])\nmodel.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))\n# Train our model\ntrain(model)\n\n### Now let's save our model and tokenizer to a directory\nmodel.save_pretrained('./my_saved_model_directory/')\ntokenizer.save_pretrained('./my_saved_model_directory/')\n\n### Reload the model and the tokenizer\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./my_saved_model_directory/')\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./my_saved_model_directory/')\n```\n\n### Optimizers: BertAdam & OpenAIAdam are now AdamW, schedules are standard PyTorch schedules\n\nThe two optimizers previously included, `BertAdam` and `OpenAIAdam`, have been replaced by a single `AdamW` optimizer which has a few differences:\n\n- it only implements weights decay correction,\n- schedules are now externals (see below),\n- gradient clipping is now also external (see below).\n\nThe new optimizer `AdamW` matches PyTorch `Adam` optimizer API and let you use standard PyTorch or apex methods for the schedule and clipping.\n\nThe schedules are now standard [PyTorch learning rate schedulers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate) and not part of the optimizer anymore.\n\nHere is a conversion examples from `BertAdam` with a linear warmup and decay schedule to `AdamW` and the same schedule:\n\n```python\n# Parameters:\nlr = 1e-3\nmax_grad_norm = 1.0\nnum_training_steps = 1000\nnum_warmup_steps = 100\nwarmup_proportion = float(num_warmup_steps) / float(num_training_steps)  # 0.1\n\n### Previously BertAdam optimizer was instantiated like this:\noptimizer = BertAdam(model.parameters(), lr=lr, schedule='warmup_linear', warmup=warmup_proportion, t_total=num_training_steps)\n### and used like this:\nfor batch in train_data:\n    loss = model(batch)\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n\n### In Transformers, optimizer and schedules are splitted and instantiated like this:\noptimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=lr, correct_bias=False)  # To reproduce BertAdam specific behavior set correct_bias=False\nscheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=num_warmup_steps, num_training_steps=num_training_steps)  # PyTorch scheduler\n### and used like this:\nfor batch in train_data:\n    model.train()\n    loss = model(batch)\n    loss.backward()\n    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_grad_norm)  # Gradient clipping is not in AdamW anymore (so you can use amp without issue)\n    optimizer.step()\n    scheduler.step()\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n```\n\n## Citation\n\nWe now have a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03771) you can cite for the 🤗 Transformers library:\n```bibtex\n@article{Wolf2019HuggingFacesTS,\n  title={HuggingFace's Transformers: State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing},\n  author={Thomas Wolf and Lysandre Debut and Victor Sanh and Julien Chaumond and Clement Delangue and Anthony Moi and Pierric Cistac and Tim Rault and Rémi Louf and Morgan Funtowicz and Joe Davison and Sam Shleifer and Patrick von Platen and Clara Ma and Yacine Jernite and Julien Plu and Canwen Xu and Teven Le Scao and Sylvain Gugger and Mariama Drame and Quentin Lhoest and Alexander M.
