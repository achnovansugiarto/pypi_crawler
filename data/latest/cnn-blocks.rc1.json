    "description": "# How to use this library?\nThis library containts all famous CNN blocks like VGG Block , residual block , inception modules etc implemented in keras.\nBlocks are constructed in a function so that one can simply write a function call and construct a CNN block.\nVarious CNN blocks can be sequentially joined with one another to construct an entire architecture.\nImplementation of popular architectures like VGG16 , ResNet-50 , Inception-v4 are already present in the repository.\nOne can also create there own architecture by stacking varoius CNN blocks and have fun while learning ðŸ˜‰.\n\n# Why this library?\nIt is sometimes difficult to understand how such deeper networks like inception-v4 or resnets are implemented.\nMost of the times we simple load a pre-trained model available in keras which is good for practical implementation\nbut hinders the educational process. Using this repository one can understand in depth how each and every block of\nCNN architecture is implemented and how these blocks are stacked together to form a large network.\nOne can also use this repository to create new architectures using various CNN blocks present.\nIf these blocks are not enough, one can create new cnn blocks in a similar fashion as given in this repository. \n\n\nChange Log\n==========\n\n0.0.1 (5/20/2021)\n-------------------\n- First Release",
