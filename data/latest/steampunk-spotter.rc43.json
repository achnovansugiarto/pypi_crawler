To create and manage tokens, visit the Steampunk Spotter \n  App's web application, open the top-right account menu, click _My Settings_\n  and switch to the _API tokens_ tab.\n\nAfter that, you can start scanning right away.\n\n```console\n$ spotter --api-token <api-token> scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ export SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token>\n$ spotter scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ spotter --username <username> --password <password> scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ export SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username>\n$ export SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password>\n$ spotter scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\nSteampunk Spotter CLI also offers for convenience the `spotter login` command,\nwhich saves the chosen credentials (in plaintext) in your user profile:\n\n```console\n$ spotter --api-token <api-token> login\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ export SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token>\n$ spotter login\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ spotter --username <username> --password <password> login\n```\n\nor:\n\n```console\n$ export SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username>\n$ export SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password>\n$ spotter login\n```\n\nAfter a successful CLI login, the credentials no longer need to be supplied\nexplicitly to the CLI commands.\n\n### Scanning\nThe CLI `spotter scan` command is used for scanning Ansible\ncontent (playbooks, roles, collections, or task files) and returning back the \nscan results.\n\n#### Ansible content\nThe `scan` command accepts a positional argument that can be one or many paths\nto files or directories.\nThe CLI will automatically detect the type of your Ansible content and scan it.\n\nThe following types of Ansible content file are currently supported:\n\n- tasks\n- playbooks\n- roles (applies to `tasks` and `handlers` folders)\n- collections (applies to `roles`, `playbooks` and\n  `tests/integration/targets/` folders and any playbooks at the root of \n  collection)\n\n```shell\n# scan task file, which contains the `tasks` section of the playbook\n$ spotter scan path/to/taskfile1.yaml\n\n# scan two playbooks\n$ spotter scan path/to/playbook1.yaml path/to/playbook2.yaml\n\n# scan multiple playbooks using glob\n$ spotter scan path/to/playbook/folder/play_*.yaml\n\n# scan two roles (scans tasks and handlers folders)\n$ spotter scan path/to/role1 path/to/role2\n\n# scan collection (scans Ansible content within roles and playbooks folders\n  and playbooks at the root of collection directory)\n$ spotter scan path/to/collection\n\n# scan multiple files at once\n$ spotter scan path/to/taskfile.yaml path/to/playbook.yaml \n          path/to/role path/to/collection\n\n# scan any folder that contains Ansible content\n$ spotter scan path/to/folder\n```\n\nLet us assume we have the following Ansible playbook `playbook.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n---\n 1 - name: Sample playbook\n 2   hosts: localhost\n 3\n 4   collections:\n 5     - sensu.sensu_go\n 6     - ansible.builtin\n 7\n 8   tasks:\n 9     - name: Create Sensu Go user\n10       user:\n11         name: joe\n12         password: \"{{ lookup('env', 'SENSU_USER_PASSWORD') }}\"\n13\n14     - name: Read-only command\n15       ansible.builtin.command: ls /tmp\n16       changed_when: false\n```\n\nIn this case, the CLI tool will report something like that back:\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan playbook.yaml\nplaybook.yaml:10:7: ERROR: Potential name clashes for user among\n  sensu.sensu_go.user, ansible.builtin.user.\nplaybook.yaml:10:7: ERROR: Use a fully-qualified name, such as\n  sensu.sensu_go.user instead of user.\nplaybook.yaml:10:7: HINT: Required collection sensu.sensu_go is missing from\n  requirements.yml or requirements.yml is missing.\nplaybook.yaml:15:7: WARNING: Default value for warn parameter changed between\n  module versions 2.10.17 and 2.11.0 from true to false. Consider setting\n  value of the parameter explicitly.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpotter took 0.190 s to scan your input.\nIt resulted in 2 error(s), 1 warning(s) and 1 hint(s).\nOverall status: ERROR\n```\n\n#### Selecting the target project\n*This part is only relevant for users with a TEAM plan or higher.*\n\nBy default, the scan results are stored in the first project of the user's\nfirst organization (in the app).\n\nUsers that have multiple organizations or projects in the app can use\n`--project-id` optional argument to specify the UUID of an existing target\nproject, where the scan result will be stored.\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --project-id <project-id> .\n```\n\nYou can learn your project id by logging into the app, selecting the\nappropriate organization and navigating to the project's dashboard.\n\n#### Including values\nBy default, CLI parses Ansible YAML content without any parameter values.\nWith values, we can discover additional tips for improvements, so if you want\nto parse and send the values, you can use `--include-values` optional argument.\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --include-values playbook.yaml\n```\n\n#### Including metadata\nBy default, CLI collects and uses metadata (file names, line and column\nnumbers, YAML markers) from Ansible content just for displaying the scan\noutput, which means that no data about your Ansible content structure is sent\nto the backend server. \nFor enriched user experience in the app and to get additional tips for\nimprovements, you can use `--include-metadata` optional argument to send the\nmetadata.\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --include-metadata playbook.yaml\n```\n\n#### Automated application of suggestions to your code\nThere is also a `--rewrite` optional argument that rewrites your files with\nfixes after scanning.\nThis action will modify your files.\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --rewrite playbook.yaml\n```\n\n#### Suppressing check result levels\nYou can use `--display-level` optional argument for suppressing check result\nlevels.\nFor example, to show only errors (suppress warnings and hints):\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --display-level error playbook.yaml \n```\n\n#### Exporting and importing scan payload\nTo see what data is collected from your Ansible content and sent to the\nbackend server, you can use the optional `--export-payload` argument.\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --export-payload payload.json playbook.yaml \nScan data saved to payload.json.\nNote: this operation is fully offline. No actual scan was executed.\n```\n\nAfter that you can also import (with `--import-payload` optional argument)\nthe exported payload and scan it:\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --import-payload payload.json\n```\n\n#### Scan configuration\nBefore scanning, it is possible to configure the environment via the\nconfiguration file or optional CLI variables.\nBy default, the CLI runs local discovery of the user's environment.\n\nCurrently, the supported variables for configuration file and options are:\n\n- `ansible_version` - sets target Ansible version\n\nWhen `--config` optional argument is used, the variables specified in\nJSON/YAML config file will overwrite the ones from local discovery.\nFor instance, if we want to overwrite the target Ansible version, we can use\nthe following JSON config file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ansible_version\": \"2.9\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd after that we can run the scan command:\n\n```shell\n$ spotter scan --config config.json playbook.yaml\n```\n\nWe can also use ``--option`` optional argument that will overwrite local\ndiscovery and config file.\nAfter `--option` optional argument, the user should provide configuration\nvia key=value pairs.\nFor instance, if we want to set the Ansible version, we can use the following\ncommand:\n\n```shell\n# scan Ansible playbooks\n$ spotter scan --option ansible_version=2.9 playbook.yaml\n```\n\n#### Formatting scan result\nBy default, the CLI will output the scan result in plain text format.\nThe `--format` optional argument allows you to specify the alternative output\nformat of the scan result such as JSON or YAML.\n\n```shell\n# scan Ansible playbooks\n$ spotter scan --format json playbook.yaml\n```\n\n#### Omitting documentation URLs from the output\nIn the scan result, the CLI will display a URL to the relevant Ansible content\ndocumentation in whenever possible.\nTo omit these documentation URLs from all the output, use `--no-docs-url`\noptional argument.\n\n```console\n$ spotter scan --no-docs-url playbook.yaml\n```\n\n### Setting storage folder\nThe CLI uses local storage for caching access tokens for the Steampunk\nSpotter API.\nThe default location is `~/.config/steampunk-spotter`, but if you want to\nchange it you can use `--storage-path` optional argument.\n\n```console\n$ spotter --storage-path /my/project/.storage scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\n### Disabling colorized output\nThe CLI will colorize the scan result by default.\nTo make the output non-colorized use `--no-colors` option.\n\n```console\n$ spotter --no-colors scan playbook.yaml\n```\n\n### Setting API endpoint\nThe CLI connects to Steampunk Spotter API (backend server) to perform scanning.\nThe default API endpoint is already set, but if you need to change it, you can\ndo this in different ways.\n\nThe precedence of the API endpoint configuration is the following, where the\nfirst one specified takes effect:\n\n1. the `--endpoint` global optional argument.\n\n    ```console\n    $ spotter --endpoint \"<spotter-api-url>\" scan playbook.yml\n    ```\n\n2. the `SPOTTER_ENDPOINT` environment variable.\n\n    ```console\n    $ export SPOTTER_ENDPOINT=<spotter-api-url>\n    ```\n\n3. configuration file from storage folder\n   (`~/.config/steampunk-spotter/spotter.json`) with the root JSON entry\n   `\"endpoint\": \"<endpoint>\"` (this allows persistent API endpoint\n   configuration).\n   You should create it manually with the following JSON content:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"endpoint\": \"<endpoint>\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. the default Spotter SaaS API endpoint:\n   `https://api.spotter.steampunk.si/api`.\n\n### CI/CD integrations\nThe CLI can be used in CI/CD pipelines to set up quality scanning of your\nAnsible content.\n\nWhen using the CLI in CI/CD workflows, it is important that you provide\nSteampunk Spotter credentials as secrets (i.e., pipeline-protected and masked\nvariables).\n\n#### GitLab\nThe CLI can be integrated with GitLab CI/CD to display scan results as\nGitLab’s unit test reports.\nThis means that you will be quickly able to see which checks have failed\nwithin your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThis is done by using Spotter CLI tool directly in the CI/CD configuration and\nconfiguring it to output your scan result in JUnit XML format, which allows\nGitLab to display check results as green check marks for successful checks and\nred crosses for unsuccessful checks.\nTo do so, you should use `spotter scan` CLI command along with\n`--junit-xml <path-junit-xml>` optional argument that will create JUnit XML\nreport at the specified location.\n\nBelow is a `.gilab-ci.yaml` example containing a CI job for the test stage,\nwhere you call the aforementioned CLI command and then upload the created\nJUnit report format XML file as an artifact to GitLab, which will then display\nit within your pipeline details page or merge request widget.\n\n```yaml\nstages:\n  - test\n\nspotter-scan:\n  stage: test\n  image:\n    name: registry.gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli:<version>\n    entrypoint: [\"\"]\n  variables:\n    SPOTTER_API_TOKEN: $SPOTTER_API_TOKEN\n  script:\n    - spotter scan --junit-xml report.xml .\n  artifacts:\n    when: always\n    reports:\n      junit: report.xml\n```\n\n#### GitHub\nIn your CI/CD pipeline, you can specify the name of the\n[Steampunk Spotter GitHub Action] (`xlab-steampunk/spotter-action@master`)\nwith a tag number as a step within your YAML workflow file. \n\nFor example, inside your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, you can do:\n\n```yaml\nname: test\non: push\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Run Ansible content scan\n        uses: xlab-steampunk/spotter-action@<version>\n        env:\n          SPOTTER_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SPOTTER_API_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nFor comprehensive usage and more examples refer to\n[Steampunk Spotter Action on GitHub Marketplace] and\n[Steampunk Spotter GitHub Action] repository.\n\n#### Others\nFor other CI/CDs, we currently only support using the [steampunk-spotter]\nPython package and setting it up as a regular shell command.\nYou can also use [spotter-cli Docker image] that is available in our GitLab \nRegistry (use `registry.gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli:latest`\nimage path and select the appropriate tag).\nYou can use `spotter scan` CLI command along with\n`--junit-xml <path-junit-xml>` optional argument to export scan result in\nJUnit XML format, which is consumed by some CI tools such as Jenkins or Bamboo.\n\n## Development\nYou will first need to clone this repository.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli\n$ cd spotter-cli\n```\n\n### Running from source\nIf you want to run directly from the source, run the following commands:\n\n```shell\n$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\n### Building Docker image\nBefore building the Docker image, copy the wheel file distribution to the\nroot of this repository.\nMake sure that you have only one `*.whl` file.\nYou can build the wheel yourself or download one from the latest CI/CD\npipeline.\nAfter that, proceed with the following commands:\n\n```shell\n$ docker build -t spotter-cli .\n```\n\nAfter that, you will be able to run scanning in a Docker container.\nYou can mount your Ansible content to the default `/scan` working directory.\nThe credentials can be specified as environment variables for the Docker\ncontainer or later via `--api-token` or `--username` and `--password` CLI\noptional arguments.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```shell\ndocker run --rm -it -e SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token> -v \"/path/to/your/playbooks/:/scan\" spotter-cli scan .\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\ndocker run --rm -it -e SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username> -e SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password> -v \"/path/to/your/playbooks/:/scan\" spotter-cli scan .\n```\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThis tool was created by [XLAB Steampunk], IT automation specialist and\nleading expert in building Enterprise Ansible Collections.\n\n[Steampunk Spotter]: https://spotter.steampunk.si/\n[steampunk-spotter]: https://pypi.org/project/steampunk-spotter/\n[PyPI production]: https://pypi.org/project/steampunk-spotter/#history\n[Sensu Go Ansible Collection]: https://galaxy.ansible.com/sensu/sensu_go\n[Steampunk Spotter GitHub Action]: https://github.com/xlab-steampunk/spotter-action\n[Steampunk Spotter Action on GitHub Marketplace]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/steampunk-spotter\n[spotter-cli Docker image]: https://gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli/container_registry/3453459\n[XLAB Steampunk]: https://steampunk.si/\n",
