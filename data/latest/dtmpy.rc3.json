    "description": "# dtmpy\n\nA Python module for doing fast Dynamic Topic Modeling.\n\nThis module wraps the original C/C++ code by David M. Blei and Sean M. Gerrish.\n\nI've refactored the original code to wrap the main function call in a class `DTM` that has Python bindings. Other code changes are listed below.\n\n## Usage\n\nBelow is an example of how to use this package. Reference the `dtmpy.DTM` docstring for all possible keyword arguments.\n\n```python\nimport dtmpy\n\n# Initialize DTM model flags\ndtm = dtmpy.DTM(corpus_prefix=\"model_inputs/file_prefix\",\n                output_name=\"model_outputs\",\n                n_topics=10)\n\n# Fit the model and write outputs from bag-of-words corpus and timestamps\ndtm.fit(my_corpus, n_docs_per_timestamp)\n\n\n# The proportion of topic 5 in document 3\ntopic_mixtures = dtm.read_topic_mixtures()\nprint(topic_mixtures[3, 5])\n\n\n# The probability of term 32 being in topic 5 at time 7\ntopic5 = dtm.read_topic_term_probabilities(5)\nprint(topic5[32, 7])\n```\n\nThere is also a sample `seq` and `mult` file in the `example` directory, which can be fit as test case using the below code:\n\n```python\nimport dtmpy\n\ndtm = dtmpy.DTM(corpus_prefix=\"example/test\", output_name=\"model_outputs\")\n\n# Load corpus and time intervals from existing seq and mult files\ncorpus, time_slices = dtm.read_corpus()\n\n# Fit the dynamic topic model\ndtm.fit(corpus, time_slices)\n```\n\n## Install\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n- `cmake`\n- `libgsl-dev`\n- `pybind11-dev`\n\nThese can be installed on Ubuntu with:\n\n```\napt-get install cmake libgsl-dev pybind11-dev\n```\n\nor on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with:\n\n```\nbrew install cmake gsl pybind11\n```\n\nAfter installing the dependencies, `dtmpy` can be installed with:\n\n```\npip install dtmpy\n```\n\nor directly from source:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jeffmm/dtmpy\ncd dtmpy\npip install .\n```\n\n## Model inputs\n\n### Fitting a corpus\n\nThe `dtmpy.DTM` class can fit a DTM model to a bag-of-words corpus that is the form of a list of lists (one list for each document), with each document list containing tuples of unique words in the document and their counts. As a simple example:\n\n```python\n# document 1 is the sentence \"foo bar bar baz\"\n# document 2 is the sentence \"bar baz bang baz\"\n\ndictionary = {0: \"foo\",\n              1: \"bar\",\n              2: \"baz\",\n              3: \"bang\"}\n\nbow_corpus = [[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)],\n              [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)]]\n```\n\nThe `bow_corpus` parameter can be passed to the `DTM.fit` method. The dictionary is only used as a convenience for post processing. The documents in the corpus should be listed in chronological order.\n\n`DTM.fit` also takes a list of number of documents to include per each time interval (time slice of the corpus) in the DTM model, `time_slices`. Optionally, you can also pass the number of time slices you want to use, `n_time_slices`, which will cause the documents to be evenly spread over all time intervals.\n\n### Mult and seq files\n\nThe original Dynamic Topic Model takes two files as inputs, which are automatically generated from the corpus and time slices when passed to the `DTM.fit` method:\n\n- `foo-mult.dat` (the `mult` file)\n- `foo-seq.dat` (the `seq` file)\n\nIf the above files are in the directory `bar` relative to the working directory, then the `corpus_prefix` argument will be `bar/foo`.\n\nIf the dataset consists of `N` docs, then the `mult` file is an `N`-length file where line `i` lists the number of unique words in document `i` and the `index:count` for each word in the document, like so:\n\n```\n\nunique_word_count_doc_1 index_11:count_11 index_12:count_12 ... index_1n:count_1n\nunique_word_count_doc_2 index_21:count_21 index_22:count_22 ...\n...\nunique_word_count_doc_N index_N1:count_N1 index_N2:count_N2 ...\n\n```\n\nWhere each word index corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary (ie listed in a dictionary somewhere)\n\nThe order of the docs in `mult` should be chronological, in order to correspond to the documents numbered in the `seq` file.\n\nThe `seq` file gives the number of documents that correspond to each time slice in the DTM, and is of the form\n\n```\n\nn_times\nnumber_docs_time_1\nnumber_docs_time_2\n...\nnumber_docs_time_n_times\n\n```\n\nTwo additional files that are useful to have somewhere are:\n\n- file with all of the words in the vocabulary, arranged in the same order as the word indices\n- a file with information on each of the documents, arranged in the same order as the docs in the `mult` file.\n\n### Loading previous inputs\n\nPreviously-generated `mult` and `seq` files can be read and used to generate corpus and time slices lists to be used in other model fits. This can be done by using the `DTM.read_corpus` method. Alternatively, the `DTM.load` method can be used to prepare the class to read previously-generated model outputs.\n\n## Model outputs\n\n### Reading model outputs\n\nThe raw output files (discussed in the next section) can be read into `numpy` arrays. The `DTM.read_topic_term_probabilities` method is used to see the estimated probabilities that terms within the corpus appeared in the specified topic at each time interval. `DTM.read_topic_mixtures` is used to see the estimated proportions of each topic within each document. See the Usage section above for an example.\n\n### Raw output files\n\nThe model outputs the following files to the directory specified by the `corpus_prefix` and `output_name` arguments.\n\n- `topic-xxx-var-e-log-prob.dat`: the e-betas (word distributions) for topic xxx for all times. This is in row-major form, e.g. (in R):\n\n```r\na = scan(\"topic-002-var-e-log-prob.dat\")\nb = matrix(a, ncol=10, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# The probability of term 100 in topic 2 at time 3:\nexp(b[100, 3])\n```\n\n- `gam.dat`: The gammas associated with each document. Divide these by the sum for each document to get expected topic mixtures.\n\n```r\na = scan(\"gam.dat\")\nb = matrix(a, ncol=10, byrow=TRUE)\nrs = rowSums(b)\ne.theta = b / rs\n\n# Proportion of topic 5 in document 3:\ne.theta[3, 5]\n```\n\nIf you are running this software in \"dim\" mode to find document influence, it will also create the following files:\n\n- `influence_time-yyy` : the influence of documents at time yyy for each topic, where time is based on in your `seq` file and the document index is given by the ordering of documents in the `mult` file.\n\n```r\na = scan(\"influence-time-010\")\nb = matrix(a, ncol=10, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# The influence of the 2nd document on topic 5:\nb[2, 5]\n```\n\n## Changes to the original code\n\n- Refactored original `main` function to be `fit` method of class `DTM`\n- Removed dependence of `gflags` and converted global flags to use extern variables that are initialized by `DTM`.\n- Added Python bindings to `DTM` class using `pybind11`\n- Better error handling to prevent commands like `exit` from crashing the Python kernel\n- Better use of `const` to limit number of compiler warnings\n- Changed some useful outputs for monitoring model fitting convergence to redirect to a `log.txt` file in the output directory rather than `stderr`\n- Fixed bug that made LDA initialization finish before converging or reaching its max iteration\n- More sane defaults:\n  - changed `corpus_prefix` and `outname` to be required arguments\n  - changed `ntopics` from -1.0 to 10\n  - changed `alpha` from -10 to 0.01\n  - changed `initialize_lda` flag to true\n\n# About the original Dynamic Topic Model code\n\n## Dynamic Topic Models and the Document Influence Model\n\nThis implements topics that change over time (Dynamic Topic Models) and a model of how individual documents predict that change.\n\nThis code is the result of work by David M.
