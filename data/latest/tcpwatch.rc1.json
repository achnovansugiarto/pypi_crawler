    "description": "TCPWatch is a utility written in Python that lets you monitor forwarded TCP\nconnections or HTTP proxy connections. It displays the sessions in a window\nwith a history of past connections. It is useful for developing and debugging\nprotocol implementations and web services.\n\nVersion 1.3 is compatible with Tkinter installations that use threads. See the\nchange log for a list of other changes.\n\nTCPWatch is licensed under ZPL 2.0 and requires Python 2.1 or later.\n\n\nVersion 1.3.1\n  \n  - Convert to use setuptools and console scripts for installation\n  \n  - Release to PyPI.\n\nVersion 1.3\n\n  - Made compatible with versions of tcl that have threads enabled.\n\n  - Log file numbers are now sequential.\n\n  - \"user@host\" is now accepted as a destination hostname (the user\n    name is ignored).\n\n\nVersion 1.2.1\n\n  - A typo made it impossible to use two of the command line options.\n    Fixed.\n\n\nVersion 1.2\n\n  - Added the ability to record TCP sessions to a directory.\n    Use -r <path>.  Implemented by Tres Seaver.\n\n  - Replaced the launch script with a distutils setup.py, thanks again\n    to Tres Seaver.\n\n\nVersion 1.1\n\n  - Almost completely rewritten.  The code is now more reusable and\n    reliable, but the user interface has not changed much.\n\n  - 8-bit clean.  (You can now use TCPWatch to verify that SSH really\n    does encrypt data. ;-) )\n\n  - It can now run as a simple HTTP proxy server using the \"-p\"\n    option.  There are a lot of interesting ways to use this.\n\n  - It's now easier to watch persistent HTTP connections.  The \"-h\"\n    option shows each transaction in a separate entry.\n\n  - You can turn off the Tkinter GUI using the -s option, which\n    outputs to stdout.\n\n  - Colorized Tkinter output.\n\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n  Never released to the public.",
