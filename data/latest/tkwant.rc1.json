    "description": "Tkwant is a python package to simulate time-dependent quantum dynamics of\nmesoscopic systems. It is the time-dependent generalization of the\n`Kwant <http://kwant-project.org>`_ package and distributed under `2-clause BSD license  <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/license>`_.\nTkwant is developed by the following `authors  <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/authors>`_.\n\n- Website: https://tkwant.kwant-project.org\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation from source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTkwant can currently only installed from its source.\nPlease visit the `installation instructions <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/installation>`_.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSource code\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe official tkwant repository is:\n\n- Source code repository: https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/tkwant.git\n\nThe *master* branch holds the current development version.\n\nTest suite\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnittests can be run directly in the local tkwant source repository from the command line::\n\n    pytest\n\nIntegration tests, that require more time to run, are started with the command::\n\n    pytest --integtest\n\nTests involving MPI can be run by the command::\n\n    pytest --mpitest\n\nThe test suite needs the Python packages ``pytest`` to be installed and tkwant compiled.\nPlease visit the `installation instructions <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/installation>`_.\nAdditional pep8 compliance checks can be activated with::\n\n    pytest --flake8\n\nwhen the optional `pytest-flake8 <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-flake8/>`_\npackage is installed.\n\n\nBuilding the documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe documentation can be build directly in the ``doc`` folder of the\nlocal tkwant source repository from the command line::\n\n    make html\n\n\nThe generated html documentation can be browsed\nby opening the file ``doc/build/html/index.html`` with a web browser.\nTo build the documentation, additional Python packages need to be installed.\nPlease visit the `installation instructions <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/installation>`_.\n\nContribution\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nContributions and feedback to tkwant are always welcome.\nWe also appreciate if you have suggestions for the documentation or find new bugs.\nIf you like to contribute new features,\nfeel free do discuss your ideas on the mailing list before opening a merge request.\nMoreover, please make sure that the tkwant test suite runs without errors before opening\na new merge request.\nSee the `Contribution <https://kwant-project.org/contribute>`_\nsection of kwant for coding style and general advice.\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\nTkwant is developed by the following\n`authors  <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/authors>`_.\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\nTkwant is distributed under\n`2-clause BSD license <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/license>`_.\nThe license can be also found in file ``LICENSE.rst`` in the project repository.\n\nHelp and Support\n----------------\n\nDocumentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe official user and developer documentation is found under:\n\n- Documentation: https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant\n\nCommunication\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe kwant-discuss mailing list is the main communication channel for\nquestions and discussions around tkwant. Searching and using the mailing list\nis explained in section\n`mailing list <https://kwant-project.org/community#mailing-list>`_.\n\n- Mailing list: kwant-discuss@kwant-project.org\n\nIn addition, the `authors  <https://kwant-project.org/extensions/tkwant/pre/authors>`_\ncan be reached by email.\n\n\nReporting bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you encounter a problem that seems to be a bug of tkwant, you can open a ticket\nwith the issue tracker.\n\n- Issue tracker: https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/tkwant/issues\n\nPlease make sure that the problem has not yet been reported in the\n`List of known tkwant bugs <https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/tkwant/issues?label_name=bug>`_.\nYou may also `search the mailing list <https://kwant-project.org/community#mailing-list>`_\nprior to open a new ticket.\nSee the the `Reporting bugs <https://kwant-project.org/community#reporting-bugs>`_\nsection of kwant for general advice.\n\nCitation\n~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you have used tkwant for work that has lead to a scientific publication,\nwe would appreciate if you cite the publication which introduces tkwant:\n\nT.
