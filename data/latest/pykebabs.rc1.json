    "description": "# pybabs\nMachine Learning algorithms already support our daily life in many areas of application.\nBe it self-driving cars, intelligent robots, or the field of computational biology. Identi-\nfying specific features from biological sequences is essential in understanding the world\nsurrounding us and its complex connections. Forensics, the development of new drugs,\nand tools for predicting certain Illnesses based on our DNA are important subareas of\nthis Topic. One standard method to do so is in the form of Support Vector Machines\n(SVM). SVMs are well suited for this task for several reasons, but the biggest profit\ncomes from their ability to use the so-called kernels for their calculation. They convert\nthe alphabetical nature of biological sequences via similarity analysis into their own\nnumerical similarity Matrices, called Kernel. This Kernel can then be used for internal\ncalculations. In the case of biological sequences, this special feature clearly distinguishes\nthe support vector machines from other machine learning algorithms\nThis thesis is based on the KEBABS Package from Johannes Palme, which was im-\nplemented in R. Hence, the user base of R is declining, and the functionalities of the\nKebabs Package are more and more sought after in other Programming languages.\nHence Python is the go-to language for processing biological Data, it makes sense to\nprovide an easy-to-use framework for manipulating and processing biological Data in\nthis well-supported platform. The Package offers two Kernels for Kernel-Based Sequence\nanalysis: the spectrum kernel and the gappy pair Kernel. Both can be used with DNA,\nRNA, and Aminoacids sequences. The Package also explicitly represents the calculated\nKernel Matrix as a whole or in the sparse format. The Package also works seamlessly\nwith multiple existing SVM Frameworks in the Python landscape, like Libsvm and the\nprevalent scikit learning library.\nThe Package also provides Cross-validation, grid search, and an unbiased model se-\nlection. For better biological interpretability, the weights used for the calculations can\neasily be extracted. Also, prediction profiles have been implemented to understand bet-\nter how some parts of a sequence contribute to the overall result.\n\n\n",
