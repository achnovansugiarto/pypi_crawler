    "description": "# PySeedRecover\nThis is a Python script to recover a\n[BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)\nmnemonic seed phrase if words are missing, were written down in a wrong or\nunknown order, or there is a typo in them, especially when used on the\nCardano crypto currency network.\n\nThis script will probably *not* help you, when you get an empty wallet\nafter restoring/importing with a seed phrase.\nSince seed phrases contain a checksum, it is very unlikely to get to\nanother valid seed phrase (that opens an empty wallet) by wrong orders or\ntypos.\nEmpty wallets rather indicate that the restored/imported seed phrase is the\nwrong one altogether – saved from a trial that was never really used or\nsomething like that.\n\n## Crypto Currency Disclaimer\nI do not endorse the use of crypto currencies or the ecosystems built around\nthem, right now.\nProof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are ecologically harmful on an\nunprecedented scale.\nProof-of-stake networks like Cardano do not have *that* problem, but still\nhave to prove their utility for real use cases.\n\nDo *not* invest money that you cannot afford to *completely* lose into\ncrypto currencies (let alone NFTs and other strange tokens without any real\nvalue)!\nTheir future is totally unclear.\n\nThe technology behind them is interesting, though.\nAnd this script does explore a part of this technology (and hopefully helps\nsome people get their wallets back).\n\n## Installation\nYou need a working Python 3 installation on your machine.\nI do development on the newest stable version (3.10), but test it also on\nthe oldest\n[still supported](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)\nversion (3.7).\n\nInstallation instructions for Windows can be found at:\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners)\n(That guide links to Python 3.7, Python 3.10 can be found at\n[https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/python-310/9pjpw5ldxlz5](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/python-310/9pjpw5ldxlz5).)\n\nFor APT-based Linux distributions `apt install python3 python3-pip` should\nbe enough and for Arch-based Linux distributions `pacman -S python\npython-pip` will install everything that is needed.\n\nThis script is then installed by `pip install PySeedRecover` (or `pip3\ninstall PySeedRecover` if the standard Python on your operating system is\nstill Python 2).\n\nAfter that, `seedrecover -h` should show you the usage information of the\nscript.\n\nIf for some reason `pip install`ed scripts are not on the path for\nexecutables on your system and you do not want to bother what is wrong, it\ncan also be executed by `python -m seedrecover -h` (or `python3 -m\nseedrecover -h` if Python 3 is not the standard on your system).\n\n## Usage\n```\nusage: seedrecover [-h] [-w FILE] [-s EDIT DISTANCE] [-o]\n                   [-l LENGTH] [-m POSITION [POSITION ...]]\n                   [-a ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]] [-k]\n                   [WORD ...]\n\nRecover Cardano seed phrases.\n\npositional arguments:\n  WORD                  known words of seed phrase\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -w FILE, --wordlist FILE\n                        wordlist to use (default: english)\n  -s EDIT DISTANCE, --similar EDIT DISTANCE\n                        try similar words up to edit distance\n  -o, --order           try different orders of seed words\n  -l LENGTH, --length LENGTH\n                        length of seed phrase\n  -m POSITION [POSITION ...], --missing POSITION [POSITION ...]\n                        missing word positions\n  -a ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...], --address ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]\n                        check for stake addresses\n  -k, --koios           check on koios.rest\n```\n> **WARNING:** If you give your (partial knowledge of your) seed phrase to\n> this script on the command line, this information will be in the history\n> of the shell you are using.\n> It is also visible on screen and can perhaps be scrolled back.\n> For security, clear the history and close the terminal after using this\n> script.\n\nWe are using a test wallet that I generated with the following seed phrase:\n```\nladder   long     kangaroo inherit  unknown  prize\nelse     second   enter    addict   mystery  valve\nriot     attitude area     blind    fabric   symbol\nskill    sunset   goose    shock    gasp     grape\n```\nThe stake address for this test wallet is\n`stake1u9t04dtwptk5776eluj6ruyd782k66npnf55tdrp6dvwnzs24r8yq`.\n\nThe simplest way to get something wrong are just small typos, some of which\nmay lead to other valid words, some of which not.\nIf we suspect that we did that, we can choose with the `-s`/`--similar`\noption, up to which edit distance we want to search for valid seed phrases:\n```\n$ seedrecover -s 1 ladder long kangaroo inherit
