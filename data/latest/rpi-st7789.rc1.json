    "description": "# RPI ST7789\n\n\nPython library to control an ST7789 TFT LCD display\n\nDesigned to work with a ST7789 based 240x240 pixel TFT SPI display.\n\n*Updated to allow spi mode to be set.*\n\n*Some ST7789 display boards have no chip select (cs) pin. The spi mode must be set to 3 for these boards to work.*\n*Other boards, including the Pirate Audio boards, work with spi mode set to 0, which is the default for the Pimoroni st7789-python driver.*\n\n*This is an update that allows a mode parameter to be passed to the driver.*\n\nUsage: Create ST7789 LCD display class for a board with no cs pin. For Pirate Audio or boards with a cs pin set mode=0, \nor even delete the \"mode=3,\" line as the default is 0.\n\n```python\n\nimport ST7789\n\ndisp = ST7789.ST7789(\n    port=0,\n    cs=ST7789.BG_SPI_CS_FRONT,  \n    dc=9,\n    rst=25,\n    backlight=13,\n    mode=3,\n    spi_speed_hz=80 * 1000 * 1000\n)   \n\n```\n\nMake sure you have the following dependencies:\n\n```\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio python-spidev python-pip python-pil python-numpy\n```\nInstall this library by running:\n\n```\nsudo pip3 install ST7789\n```\n\n# Licensing & History\n\nThis library is a modification of a modification of code originally written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries, and modified to work with the ST7735 by Clement Skau.\n\nTo create this ST7789 driver, it has been hard-forked from st7735-python which was originally modified by Pimoroni to include support for their 160x80 SPI LCD breakout.\n\n## Modifications include:\n\n* PIL/Pillow has been removed from the underlying display driver to separate concerns- you should create your own PIL image and display it using `display(image)`\n* `mode`, `width`, `height`, `rotation`, `invert`, `offset_left` and `offset_top` parameters can be passed into `__init__` for alternate displays\n* `Adafruit_GPIO` has been replaced with `RPi.GPIO` and `spidev` to closely align with our other software (IE: Raspberry Pi only)\n* Test fixtures have been added to keep this library stable\n\nPimoroni invests time and resources forking and modifying this open source code, please support Pimoroni and open-source software by purchasing products from them, too!\n\nAdafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!\n\nModified from the Pimoroni st7789-python 'Modified from 'Adafruit Python ILI9341' written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries.' written by Clement Skau.\n\nMIT license, all text above must be included in any redistribution\n\n0.0.3\n-----\n\n* option to set spi mode\n\n0.0.2\n-----\n\n* Fix for image retention\n* Drop defunct parameters\n\n0.0.1\n-----\n\n* Initial Release\n\n\n",
