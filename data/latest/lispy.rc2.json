    "description": "lispy\n=====\n\nAn extension of Peter Norvig's lispy (http://norvig.com/lispy.html)\nwhich includes the ability to access symbols from python packages as\nif they were written in lispy. \n\nThis experiment was initially intended to let me play with scheme while\nstill having access to python's batteries.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nI've been writing a lot of python code, and I love the python\necosystem. It has wonderful tools for web application development\n(Django, Flask, Pyramid), data munging (Beautiful Soup, requests) and\ndata analysis (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython). I'd like to learn more\nabout the internal implementation of python, its introspection\nabilities and its design decisions. I'd also like to better understand\nthe LISP ecosystem, what better way than implementing a LISP in\npython.\n\nCurrent Features\n----------------\n\n  - A minimal scheme implementation in Python (based on Peter Norvig's lispy)\n  - A scheme implementation which can call python functions within the same process\n  - The begining of a \"dialect framework\" which will allow customized\n    lisp dialects with changes to the lanage implemented in either\n    python or a lispy dialect\n\nGoals\n-----\n\nThis is currently a pet project to facilitate learning the LISP and\nscheme ecosystems and to bring about a better understanding of the\ntheory and complexity of language design. My roadmap includes several\nadditions to lispy to make it a toolkit for python developers who\nmight be interested in dipping their toe in LISP. For functionality\nthat's left to be implemented please check the issue tracker for the\nproject at https://github.com/adamhaney/lispy/issues",
