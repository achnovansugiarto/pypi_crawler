    "description": ".. This README is meant for consumption by humans and pypi. Pypi can render rst files so please do not use Sphinx features.\n   If you want to learn more about writing documentation, please check out: http://docs.plone.org/about/documentation_styleguide.html\n   This text does not appear on pypi. It is a comment.\n\ncollective.droproles\n====================\n\nThis is a monkey patch for PAS (``PluggableAuthService``).\nIt drops roles like Manager or Editor on Plone Sites.\nAn Editor can still login, but only has the Member and Authenticated roles.\n\nIt differs from `collective.denyroles <https://github.com/collective/collective.denyroles/>`_\nwhich completely denies access to someone with one of these roles: they cannot login.\nThis login failure may be confusing.\nI want to move the sites where I used this, over to the newer ``collective.droproles``.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- A patch for methods ``getRoles``, ``getRolesInContext``, and ``allowed`` on various user classes,\n  returning the original list, but with the following roles removed:\n  Manager, Site Administrator, Editor, Reviewer, Contributor.\n  This is temporary: no database changes are made.\n\n- Configuration via environment variable ``DROP_ROLES``.\n  By default we do not drop roles, but with ``DROP_ROLES=1``, we do drop them.\n\n\nUse case\n--------\n\nYou have a Plone Site on two domains:\n\n- edit.example.local is for editing.\n  Users with the Editor or Manager role login here to edit and manage the site.\n  This is a local domain that can only be reached within your local network or a VPN.\n\n- www.example.org is for anonymous users and maybe also for standard Members without extra roles.\n  This domain is protected by a special firewall to prevent common web attacks like\n  dubious form submissions, request flooding, spammers, cross site scripting attacks, etcetera.\n\nProblems:\n\n- Editors sometimes login to the public domain,\n  and get errors during editing because the firewall is too protective.\n\n- The system administrator complains that he has setup a special domain for editing and managing,\n  so that no changes can come in from the public site,\n  and yet unexpectedly the editors can login and make changes via the public site anyway.\n\nThis package gives you the option to treat all users as having at most the Member or Authenticated roles.\nA Manager can login, but cannot go to the Plone overview controlpanel.\n\n\nUser classes\n------------\n\nThe following classes are patched::\n\n    AccessControl.users.BasicUser\n    AccessControl.users.SimpleUser\n    Products.PlonePAS.plugins.ufactory.PloneUser\n    Products.PluggableAuthService.PropertiedUser.PropertiedUser\n\nThis covers standard Plone.\n\nI have **not** tested with users coming from other sources, like LDAP.\nIt might work out of the box though.\nIf it does not work, and your LDAP users have a special class, try calling ``patch_class(your_ldap_class)``.\n\n\nDropped roles\n-------------\n\nThe following roles are dropped::\n\n    Manager\n    Site Administrator\n    Editor\n    Reviewer\n    Contributor\n\nIf you have other roles that you want to drop, you may need to add it to the set of ``USER_CLASSES`` via a monkey patch.\n\nSee also the `Dropping all roles`_ section.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall collective.droproles by adding it to your buildout::\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    eggs =\n        collective.droproles\n\n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    environment-vars =\n        DROP_ROLES 1\n\nand then running ``bin/buildout``.\n\nWithout the environment variable, it does nothing.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nYou can set an environment variable to drop the roles::\n\n    export DROP_ROLES=1\n\nSet this to 1 (or another positive integer) for yes, and 0 for no.\nAny other values will be ignored.\n\nNote that the OS environment can be different when you manually start your Plone instance or start it in a cronjob.\nSo it is better to set this in your Plone ``buildout.cfg``::\n\n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    environment-vars =\n        DROP_ROLES 1\n\nRun the buildout and it will be set in the Plone config,\nin this case in ``parts/instance/etc/zope.conf``.\n\nIf you have a ZEO setup with two zeoclients, where one zeoclient gets all traffic from editors, and another gets the anonymous visitors, you can do this:\n\n- zeoclient for editors: ``DROP_ROLES 0``\n- zeoclient for anonymous: ``DROP_ROLES 1``\n\nNow editors can edit normally in their edit environment.\nAnd when they accidentally login on the anonymous environment, they will be treated as simple Members without extra roles.\n\nTechnically, ``DROP_ROLES 0`` does nothing, because it is the default.\nBut it may be good to be specific.\n\n\nDropping all roles\n------------------\n\nIf you want to drop **all** roles, you can use the environment variable ``DROP_ALL_ROLES``::\n\n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    environment-vars =\n        DROP_ALL_ROLES 1\n\nIn this case the ``DROP_ROLES`` environment variable is no longer checked.\n\nWith ``DROP_ALL_ROLES`` we change the patches:\n\n- ``getRoles`` and ``getRolesInContext`` always return a list with a single entry: ``Anonymous``.\n- The ``allowed`` method returns True when the required object roles are None or contain Anonymous, otherwise it returns False.\n\nYou can still login, and the pages will show your name, but you basically cannot make any changes.\nProbably you can fill in a form with ``collective.easyform``, but that should be about the only thing you can do that makes a change to the database.\n\nThat would be the use case: prevent all (or most) changes to the database.\n\n\nSuggested buildout usage\n------------------------\n\nThis is a suggestion on how to properly add this in a buildout.\nNote that this focuses on configuring collective.droproles, and ignores lots of other useful settings::\n\n    [zeoclient]\n    # Configuration for public zeoclient.\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    http-address = 8080\n    zeo-client = on\n    eggs =\n        Plone\n        collective.droproles\n    # Environment variables shared by all zeoclients:\n    base-environment-vars =\n        zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true\n    environment-vars =\n        ${:base-environment-vars}\n    # In the public zeoclient, we drop roles:\n        DROP_ROLES 1\n\n    [zeoclient-cms]\n    # Second Plone zeoclient, only used for CMS, so for editors.\n    # The next weird line means: inherit all settings from the [zeoclient] section:\n    <= zeoclient\n    # Use a different port:\n    http-address = 8090\n    environment-vars =\n        ${:base-environment-vars}\n    # In the CMS zeoclient, we do not want to drop roles:\n        DROP_ROLES 0\n\n    [instance]\n    # Standalone Plone instance without ZEO setup, for local development.\n    <= zeoclient\n    zeo-client = off\n    environment-vars =\n        ${:base-environment-vars}\n    # With single instance, we do not want to drop roles:\n        DROP_ROLES 0\n\n\nftw.upgrade\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you use the ``bin/upgrade`` script from ``ftw.upgrade``,\nyou are automatically authenticated and have the Manager role.\nBut if this script attaches itself to the public zeoclient above,\nthe Manager role would be dropped, making the script useless.\nWe have a patch for this that is active when our other patches are active.\nSo: ``bin/upgrade`` should work just fine.\n\nNote: it will *not* work when you have enabled ``DROP_ALL_ROLES``.\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you are having issues, please let us know.\nContact Maurits van Rees at Zest Software,
