It can be copied,\nmodified, cited, etc. without any limitations.\n\n**Citation info:** J. M. Hoekstra and J.

You can find the latest release here:\nhttps://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky/releases\nThe BlueSky pip package is installed with the following command:\n\n    pip install bluesky-simulator[full]\n\nUsing ZSH? Add quotes around the package name: `\"bluesky-simulator[full]\"`. For more installation instructions go to the Wiki.\n\n## BlueSky Wiki\nInstallation and user guides are accessible at:\nhttps://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky/wiki\n\n## Some features of BlueSky:\n- Written in the freely available, ultra-simple-hence-easy-to-learn, multi-platform language\nPython 3 (using numpy and either pygame or Qt+OpenGL for visualisation) with source\n- Extensible by means of self-contained [plugins](https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky/wiki/plugin)\n- Contains open source data on navaids, performance data of aircraft and geography\n- Global coverage navaid and airport data\n- Contains simulations of aircraft performance, flight management system (LNAV, VNAV under construction),\nautopilot, conflict detection and resolution and airborne separation assurance systems\n- Compatible with BADA 3.x data\n- Compatible wth NLR Traffic Manager TMX as used by NLR and NASA LaRC\n- Traffic is controlled via user inputs in a console window or by playing scenario files (.SCN)\ncontaining the same commands with a time stamp before the command (\"HH:MM:SS.hh>\")\n- Mouse clicks in traffic window are use in console for lat/lon/heading and position inputs\n\n## Contributions\nBlueSky can be considered 'perpetual beta'. We would like to encourage anyone with a strong interest in\nATM and/or Python to join us. Please feel free to comment, criticise, and contribute to this project. Please send suggestions, proposed changes or contributions through GitHub pull requests, preferably after debugging it and optimising it for run-time performance.\n\n\n",
