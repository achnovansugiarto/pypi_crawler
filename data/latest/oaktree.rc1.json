    "description": "=======\noaktree\n=======\n\nMake your cloud throw some shade\n\noaktree is a gRPC interface for interacting with OpenStack clouds that is\ninherently interoperable and multi-cloud aware. It is based on the python\nshade library, which grew all of the logic needed to interact with OpenStack\nclouds and to work around differences in vendor deployment choices. Rather\nthan keep all of that love in Python Library form, oaktree allows othre\nlanguages to reap the benefits as well.\n\noaktree is not a replacement for all of the individual project REST APIs.\nThose are all essential for cross-project communication and are well suited\nfor operators who can be expected to know things about how they have\ndeployed their clouds - and who in fact WANT to be able to make changes in\nthe cloud knowing deployment specifics. oaktree will never be for them.\n\noaktree is for end-users who do not and should not know what hypervisor, what\nstorage driver or what network stack the deployer has chosen. The two sets\nof people are different audiences, so oaktree is a project to support the\nend user.\n\nUsing\n-----\n\nInstall oaktreemodel by hand. Then:\n\nIn one window:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  python oaktree/server.py\n\noaktree/server.py assumes you have a clouds.yaml accessible.\n\nIn another window:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  python -i devstack/test.py\n\nYou'll have an images and a flavors object you can poke at.\n\nIf you want to operate against a different cloud than `devstack`, you can\npass it to devstack/test.py as the first command line argument.\n\nShape of the Project\n--------------------\n\noaktree should be super simple to deploy, and completely safe for deployers\nto upgrade from master constantly. Once it's released as a 1.0, it should\nNEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER have a backwards incompatible change.\nThere is no reason, no justification, no obessession important enough to\ninflict such pain on the user.\n\nThe shade library will grow the ability to detect if a cloud has an oaktree\napi available, and if it does, it will use it. Hopefully we'll quickly reach\na point where all deployers are deploying oaktree.\n\n* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oaktree\n* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/oaktree\n* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/oaktree",
