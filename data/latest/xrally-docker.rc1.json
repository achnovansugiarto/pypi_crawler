    "description": "# xrally-docker\n\nxRally plugins for [Docker engine](https://www.docker.com).\n\n## What is it?!\n\nOriginally, it was created as a quick proof-of-concept to show ability of\n[Rally](https://github.com/openstack/rally) to test platforms other than\n[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/). After the first preview,\nit became obvious that it should be developed as a complete package.\n\n__xrally_docker__ is a pack of xRally plugins for execution different workloads\nat the top of Docker Engine. Such workloads can be used as like for testing\nenvironments with Docker or testing behaviour of specified docker image.\n\n## How to use?!\n\n### Install package\n\n__xrally_docker__ package is configured to be auto-discovered by Rally. Since\nrally package is a dependency of __xrally_docker__ , so to start using\n__xrally_docker__ you need to install just one package:\n\n```commandline\n\npip install xrally_docker\n\n```\n\n### Specify entry-point of docker engine to use\n\nThe next step is to specify entry-point to docker, i.e. create rally \nenvironment. There are 2 way to do it:\n\n1. Specify environment specification manually. For a simple case (no cert, \n   tls, etc), it looks like ``{\"docker@existing\": {}}``.\n2. Create environment specification from system environment variables \n   (supported by Rally >= 0.11.2) using \n   ``rally env create --name example --from-sysenv`` command. An expected \n   system variables are the same as native docker client supports.\n\n### Check that Rally can access the docker\n\nFirst of all try to execute ``rally env check`` command. It checks all \nplatforms of the environment to be available. If it does not show any errors \nfor communicating with docker, go and execute any task against docker. \nIf is fails, try to execute the command again with ``--detailed`` flag.\n\nAlso, you can use ``rally env info`` command for the same purpose. Unlike \n``rally env check`` it will not only check the platforms, but print some \ninformation about them. In case of docker platform, it will print the similar \nto ``docker --version`` data.\n\n### Execute a workload against docker\n\nHere is a simple workload:\n\n```yaml\n\n---\n  version: 2\n  title: Simple task with only one workload\n  subtasks:\n    -\n      title: a subtask with one workload\n      description: This workload should run a container from \"ubuntu\" \n                   image and execute simple command.\n      scenario:\n        Docker.run_container:\n          image_name: \"ubuntu\"\n          command: \"echo 'Hello world!'\"\n      runner:\n        constant:\n          times: 10\n          concurrency: 2\n      sla:\n        failure_rate:\n          max: 0\n```\n\nThis task will download _ubuntu_ image first, if it does not present in the \nsystem. Then, it will run 10 containers from the image with 2 concurrency and \nexecute a  simple command. The output of the command will be saved as \nTextArea and will be available via json and html reports.\n\nSee plugin references for the full list of available plugins for docker \nplatform to combine workloads. \n\n## Known issues\n\nThis package works fine, but you need to install the proper version of Docker\nclient which suits your Docker API version.",
