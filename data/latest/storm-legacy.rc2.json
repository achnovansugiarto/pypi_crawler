    "description": "What is this fork?\n==================\nI use Storm in a big private project and due to Storm I have\nbeen stuck with Python 2.7. This forks fixes that by adding\nsupport for Python 3.3 and later. To do that I removed\nfunctionality that I don't use myself, and feel is outdated. In\nthe long run I think completely switching to\n[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the only correct\nchoice. But since it was easier to port Storm I decided to go\nwith that approach for now.\n\nI'll maintain this fork until I've replaced Storm, which likely\nwon't happen for years.\n\nThe reason for forking is that Storm hasn't seen a release in\nalmost five years; the last release was 0.20 2013-06-28. I forked\nthe current trunk on 2018-05-04 which had quite a few fixes for\nthings that are broken in 0.20. The trunk revision at the time\nwas [#484](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~storm/storm/trunk/files/484?start_revid=484).\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\nThe `CHANGELOG` file will not be updated as it is from the unforked\nversion. I've decided to restart the version numbering.\n\n\n### Version 0.2.0 (alpha)\nReleased on 8th Mars 2019\n\n * Made `PropertyRegistry.add_class` optionally work as a decorator\n * Re-added `storm.version` and `storm.version_info` for libraries and\n   applications that have specific Storm version requirements. The version\n   is specified as `0.21.0` (issue\n   [#1](https://github.com/runfalk/storm-legacy/issues/1)).\n * Removed `CaptureTracer` support\n * Removed `TimeoutTracer` support\n * Refactored test suite to use pytest. This solves a lot of\n   warnings during tests.\n\n\n### Version 0.1.0 (alpha)\nReleased on 8th October 2018\n\nThis release mostly removes features. The release is mostly a test\nof how well it works with other applications. This release comes\nafter storm 0.20.\n\n * Added `Database.get_uri()` method\n * Added `ResultSet` support to be used as subquery\n * Added support for Python 3.3\n * Added support for Python 3.4\n * Added support for Python 3.5\n * Added support for Python 3.6\n * Added support for Python 3.7\n * Added support for Postgresql `CASE` statement\n * Added support for Union of different classes as long as the columns\n   are of the same type\n * Changed psycopg2 requirement to `>=2.5`\n * Changed test runner to pytest\n * Fixed storm accidentally installing `tests` directory in `site-packages`\n * Fixed `psycopg2>=2.5` support using ABCMeta base class injection for\n   exceptions\n * Removed MySQL support\n * Removed Pickle column type (use JSON or re-implement it yourself)\n * Removed Python 2.6 and earlier support\n * Removed Schema management\n * Removed SQLObject support\n * Removed Twisted integration\n * Removed WSGI debug timeline\n * Removed Zope integration\n\n\nOriginal description\n====================\n\nStorm is an Object Relational Mapper for Python developed at\nCanonical.  API docs, a manual, and a tutorial are available from:\n\nhttp://storm.canonical.com/\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe project was in development for more than a year for use in\nCanonical projects such as Launchpad and Landscape before being\nreleased as free software on July 9th, 2007.\n\nDesign:\n\n * Clean and lightweight API offers a short learning curve and\n   long-term maintainability.\n * Storm is developed in a test-driven manner. An untested line of\n   code is considered a bug.\n * Storm needs no special class constructors, nor imperative base\n   classes.\n * Storm is well designed (different classes have very clear\n   boundaries, with small and clean public APIs).\n * Designed from day one to work both with thin relational\n   databases, such as SQLite, and big iron systems like PostgreSQL\n   and MySQL.\n * Storm is easy to debug, since its code is written with a KISS\n   principle, and thus is easy to understand.\n * Designed from day one to work both at the low end, with trivial\n   small databases, and the high end, with applications accessing\n   billion row tables and committing to multiple database backends.\n * It's very easy to write and support backends for Storm (current\n   backends have around 100 lines of code).\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Storm is fast.\n * Storm lets you efficiently access and update large datasets by\n   allowing you to formulate complex queries spanning multiple\n   tables using Python.\n * Storm allows you to fallback to SQL if needed (or if you just\n   prefer), allowing you to mix \"old school\" code and ORM code\n * Storm handles composed primary keys with ease (no need for\n   surrogate keys).\n * Storm doesn't do schema management, and as a result you're free\n   to manage the schema as wanted, and creating classes that work\n   with Storm is clean and simple.\n * Storm works very well connecting to several databases and using\n   the same Python types (or different ones) with all of them.\n * Storm can handle `obj.attr = <An SQL expression>` assignments, when\n   that's really needed (the expression is executed at INSERT/UPDATE\n   time).\n * Storm handles relationships between objects even before they were\n   added to a database.\n * Storm works well with existing database schemas.\n * Storm will flush changes to the database automatically when\n   needed, so that queries made affect recently modified objects.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (C) 2006-2009 Canonical, Ltd.

If not, and for reference, the long version\nis below.\n\n```bash\ndev/ubuntu-deps\nmake develop\ndev/db-setup\nmake check\n```\n\nLONG VERSION:\n\nThe following instructions describe the procedure for setting up a\ndevelopment environment and running the test suite.\n\nInstalling dependencies\n-----------------------\n\nThe following instructions assume that you're using Ubuntu.  The\nsame procedure will probably work without changes on a Debian system\nand with minimal changes on a non-Debian-based linux distribution.\nIn order to run the test suite, and exercise all supported backends,\nyou will need to install MySQL and PostgreSQL, along with the\nrelated Python database drivers:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    python-mysqldb mysql-server \\\n    postgresql pgbouncer \\\n    build-essential\n```\n\nThese will take a few minutes to download (its a bit under 200MB all\ntogether).  Once the download is complete, a screen called\n\"configuring mysql-server-5.0\" will be shown.  When asked for a\npassword for the root user leave the field blank and hit enter to\ncontinue.  This is not a recommended setting for a production\nserver, but makes life easier on a development machine.  You may be\nasked to enter a password multiple times.  Leave it blank in each\ncase.\n\nThe Python dependencies for running tests can mostly be installed with\napt-get:\n\n```bash\napt-get install \\\n    python-fixtures python-psycopg2 \\\n    python-testresources python-transaction python-twisted \\\n    python-zope.component python-zope.security\n```\n\nOne module - pgbouncer - is not yet packaged in Ubuntu. It can be\ninstalled from PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pgbouncer\n\nAlternatively, dependencies can be downloaded as eggs into the current\ndirectory with: `make develop`\n\nThis ensures that all dependencies are available, downloading from\nPyPI as appropriate.\n\nSetting up database users and access security\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPostgreSQL needs to be setup to allow TCP/IP connections from\nlocalhost.  Edit `/etc/postgresql/8.3/main/pg_hba.conf` and make\nsure the following line is present:\n\n```\nhost all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust\n```\n\nThis will probably (with PostgresSQL 8.4) entail changing 'md5' to\n'trust'.\n\nIn order to run the two-phase commit tests, you will also need to\nchange the max_prepared_transactions value in postgres.conf to\nsomething like\n\n```\nmax_prepared_transactions = 200\n```\n\nNow save and close, then restart the server:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart postgresql\n```\n\nLets create our PostgreSQL user now. As noted in the Ubuntu PostgreSQL\ndocumentation, the easiest thing is to create a user with the same\nname as your username.  Run the following command to create a user\nfor yourself (if prompted for a password, leave it blank):\n\n```bash\nsudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER\n```\n\nCreating test databases\n-----------------------\n\nThe test suite needs some local databases in place to exercise\nPostgreSQL functionality:\n\n```bash\ncreatedb storm_test\n```\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nFinally, its time to run the tests!  Go into the base directory of\nthe storm branch you want to test, and run:\n\n```bash\nmake check\n```\n\nThey'll take a while to run.  All tests should pass: failures mean\nthere's a problem with your environment or a bug in Storm.",
