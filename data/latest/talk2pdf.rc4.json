Create an OpenAI account\n2. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)\n    1. Click on your account in the top right\n    2. Click View API Keys\n    3. Click \"Create new secret key\"\n    4. You will need to provide this API key to talk2pdf (see below)\n\n`talk2pdf` uses FFmpeg for video/audio operations and yt-dlp to download video from online streaming services.\n\n```\nbrew install ffmpeg yt-dlp\n```\n\n```\napt-get install ffmpeg yt-dlp\n```\n\n## Running\n\n> **Warning**\n> This will cost ~$0.50 / hr of video\n\nThis will generate a PDF in the current directory:\n\nWith a youtube video\n```bash\npipenv shell\npip install talk2pdf\n\nexport OPENAPI_SECRET=sk-...\npython -m talk2pdf <youtube-url>\n```\n\nOr, with an existing video file\n```bash\npipenv shell\npip install talk2pdf\n\nexport OPENAPI_SECRET=sk-...\npython -m talk2pdf <video-file>\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n`talk2pdf` looks in `TALK2PDF_CONFIG_DIR`, then `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/talk2pdf`, and finally `$HOME/.config/talk2pdf` for a `config.json` file.\nYou can put your OpenAI key in there instead of setting it in the environment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"openapi_secret\": \"sk-...\"\n}\n```\n\n`talk2pdf` uses `TALK2PDF_CACHE_DIR`, or `XDG_CACHE_HOME/talk2pdf`, or finally `$HOME/.cache/talk2pdf` as a cache directory.\nThis is where intermediate files are stored.\n\n## Contributing\n\n```bash\npipenv shell\npip install --editable .\npython -m talk2pdf ...\n```\n\n```\npip install --upgrade build twine\nrm -rf dist\npython -m build\npython3 -m twine upload dist/*\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] add timestamps to each paragraph\n",
