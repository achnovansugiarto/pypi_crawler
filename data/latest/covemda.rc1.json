    "description": "# CoVEMDA (Python Version)\n\n**CoronaVirus - Electricity Market Data Analyzer (CoVEMDA)** is an open-access and ready-to-use toolbox to track COVID-19 impacts on U.S. power systems. This document is a quick overview of this toolbox.\n\n\n## Features\n\nCoVEMDA is primarily working with COVID-EMDA+ data hub, with some major functions such as: baseline estimation, regression analysis, scientific visualization, and other useful supplementary functions.\n\nExtenal data and models are allowed for further extensions.\n\n\n## Navigation\n\nCoVEMDA root directory contains four folders, a setup.py script, a README.md document, and a LICENSE text file. One can run the setup script to check the dependencies of current environment, or use pip command to retrieve from PyPI.\n\nFolder `lib/` contains the source codes for CoVEMDA, which are collectively organized in several script files according to the realized functions. It is recommended to call the **integrated functions** or **high-level functions** as they are user-oriented and simple to use. Turn to **low-level functions** only in case that more flexible and refined configurations are required.\n\nFolder `docs/` contains a **User Manual** for CoVEMDA. This manual includes simple guidance for first-time users, as well as detailed explanation of all the features and functions, along with illustrative examples. Though this is a complete guide for anyone that is interested in more details, reading **Section 1 (Introduction)** and **Section 2 (Getting Started)** is enough for beginners to try it out.\n\nFolder `data/` contains the temporary files of CoVEMDA, including a data collection updated to March 2021 (`data/data_archive/`) and several pretrained backcast models (`data/backcast`).\n\n\n## User Manual\n\nAn extensive **User Manual** is attached to the toolbox, which can be found at `docs/`. In this manual, users may find some basic-level guidances as well as comprehensive details of the toolbox implementation. Here, the the manual are organized with the following sections:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Getting Started\n3. Data Hub\n4. Toolbox\n5. Baseline Estimation\n6. Regression Analysis\n7. Scientific Visualization\n8. Acknowledgments\n\nWe highly recommend you to read Section 1 and 2 before using CoVEMDA. The rest of the manual introduces all the features, classes, and functions from principle to practice in detail. Read Section 3 and 4 to get some knowledge of the programming architecture and useful interfaces. Read Section 5, 6, and 7 for advanced usage and customization. \n\n\n\n",
