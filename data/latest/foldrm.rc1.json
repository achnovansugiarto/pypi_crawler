    "description": "# FOLD-RM\nThe implementation details of FOLD-RM algorithm and how to use it are described here. The target of FOLD-RM algorithm is to learn an answer set program for a classification task. Answer set programs are logic programs that permit negation of predicates and follow the stable model semantics for interpretation. The rules generated are essentially default rules. Default rules (with exceptions) closely model human thinking.\n\n## Installation\n### Prerequisites\nThe FOLD-RM algorithm is developed with only python3. Numpy is the only dependency:\n\n<code>\n\t\n\tpython3 -m pip install numpy\n\t\n</code>\n\n## Instruction\n### Data preparation\n\nThe FOLD-RM algorithm takes tabular data as input, the first line for the tabular data should be the feature names of each column.\nThe FOLD-RM algorithm does not have to encode the data for training. It can deal with numerical, categorical, and even mixed type features (one column contains both categorical and numerical values) directly.\nHowever, the numerical features should be identified before loading the data, otherwise they would be dealt like categorical features (only literals with = and != would be generated).\n\nThere are many UCI example datasets that have been used to pre-populate the **data** directory. Code for preparing these datasets has already been added to datasets.py.\n\n\nFor example, the UCI wine dataset can be loaded with the following code:\n\n<code>\n\t\n    attrs = ['alcohol','malic_acid','ash','alcalinity_of_ash','magnesium','tot_phenols','flavanoids',\n    'nonflavanoid_phenols','proanthocyanins','color_intensity','hue','OD_of_diluted','proline']\n    model = Classifier(attrs=attrs, numeric=attrs, label='label')\n    data = model.load_data('data/wine/wine.csv')\n    print('\\n% wine dataset', np.shape(data))\n    return model, data\n\n</code>\n\n**attrs** lists all the features needed, **nums** lists all the numerical features, **label** is the name of the output classification label, **model** is an initialized classifier object with the configuration of wine dataset. \n\n### Training\nThe FOLD-RM algorithm generates an explainable model that is represented by an answer set program for classification tasks. Here's a training example for wine dataset:\n\n<code>\n\t\n    model.fit(X_train, Y_train, ratio=0.9)\n\t\n</code>\n\nNote that the hyperparameter **ratio** in **fit** function can be set by the user, and ranges between 0 and 1. Default value is 0.5. This hyperparameter represents the ratio of training examples that are part of the exception to the examples implied by only the default conclusion part of the rule. We recommend that the user experiment with this hyperparameter by trying different values to produce a ruleset with the best F1 score. A range between 0.5 and 0.9 is recommended for experimentation.\n\nThe rules generated by foldrpp will be stored in the model object. These rules are organized in a nested intermediate representation. The nested rules will be automatically flattened and decoded to conform to the syntax of answer set programs by calling **print_asp** function: \n\n<code>\n\t\n    model.print_asp()\n\t\n</code>\n\nAn answer set program, compatible with the s(CASP) answer set programming system, is printed as shown below. The s(CASP) system is a system for direclty executing predicate answer set programs in a query-driven manner.\n\n<code>\n\n    % wine dataset (178, 14)\n    label(X,'1') :- rule2(X), not rule1(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule1(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule4(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X), not rule3(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule5(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X), not rule3(X), not rule4(X). \n    label(X,'3') :- rule3(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X). \n    rule1(X) :- color_intensity(X,N9), N9=<3.4. \n    rule2(X) :- flavanoids(X,N6), N6>2.03, not ab1(X). \n    rule3(X) :- flavanoids(X,N6), N6=<1.57, not ab2(X). \n    rule4(X) :- alcohol(X,N0), N0>11.56. \n    rule5(X) :- alcohol(X,N0), N0=<11.56. \n    ab1(X) :- proline(X,N12), N12=<678.0. \n    ab2(X) :- hue(X,N10), N10>0.96. \n    % acc 0.9722\n\t\n</code>\n\n### Testing in Python\nGiven **X_test**, a list of test data samples, the Python **predict** function will predict the classification outcome for each of these data samples. \n\n<code>\n\t\n\tY_test_hat = model.predict(X_test)\n\n</code>\n\nThe **classify** function can also be used to classify a single data sample.\n\t\n<code>\n\t\n\ty_test_hat = model.classify(x_test)\n\n</code>\n\t\n### Explanation\n\nFOLD-RM provides simple format justification and rebuttal for predictions with **explain** function. \n\n<code>\n\t\n\tmodel.explain(X_test[i])\n\t\n</code>\n\nHere is an example for a instance from wine dataset. The generated answer set program is :\n\n<code>\n\t\n    % wine dataset (178, 14)\n    label(X,'1') :- rule2(X), not rule1(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule1(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule4(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X), not rule3(X). \n    label(X,'2') :- rule5(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X), not rule3(X), not rule4(X). \n    label(X,'3') :- rule3(X), not rule1(X), not rule2(X). \n    rule1(X) :- color_intensity(X,N9), N9=<3.4. \n    rule2(X) :- flavanoids(X,N6), N6>2.03, not ab1(X). \n    rule3(X) :- flavanoids(X,N6), N6=<1.57, not ab2(X). \n    rule4(X) :- alcohol(X,N0), N0>11.56. \n    rule5(X) :- alcohol(X,N0), N0=<11.56. \n    ab1(X) :- proline(X,N12), N12=<678.0. \n    ab2(X) :- hue(X,N10), N10>0.96. \n    % acc 0.9722\n\n</code>\n\nAnd the generated justification for an instance prediction:\n\n<code>\n\t\n    Explanation for example number 1 :\n    [F]ab1(X) :- [F]proline(X,N12), N12=<678.0. \n    [T]rule2(X) :- [T]flavanoids(X,N6), N6>2.03, not [F]ab1(X). \n    [F]rule1(X) :- [F]color_intensity(X,N9), N9=<3.4. \n    [T]label(X,'1') :- [T]rule2(X), not [F]rule1(X). \n    {'color_intensity: 6.38', 'proline: 970.0', 'flavanoids: 3.0'}   \n\n</code>\n\nIn the generated answers, each literal has been tagged with a label. **[T]** means True, **[F]** means False, and **[U]** means unnecessary to evaluate. And the smallest set of features of the instance is listed for each answer.\n\n\n",
