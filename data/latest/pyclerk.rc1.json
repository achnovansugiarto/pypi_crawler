    "description": "# PyClerk\nUse python to access all U.S. caselaw through the Harvard Law School Library [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law).\n\nPyClerk is a Python package that simplifies accessing the Caselaw Access Project's Web API (CAPAPI). Its goal it to reduce the necessary overhead to accessing CAPAPI from reading their detailed but dense documentation to simply importing a python package and trying out a few lines of code.\n\nThe current alpha version provides this simplicity for the Cases endpoint, especially for the single case API. While this is somewhat limited functionality compared to the full CAPAPI, this initial release will enable users to access the core data of CAP without leaving Python. \n\n### Trying Out PyClerk\n\nThe  the completed project is hosted on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://www.pypi.org/project/pyclerk).  \n\nInstalling and trying PyClerk is easy.  You'll need Python 3 installed as well as its package manager 'pip'. Some machines come with Python 2 installed as default as an OS dependency.  On these, you may need to replace `pip` in the instructions with `pip3`. In a terminal window, or in a python virtual environment if you prefer:\n - install PyClerk: `pip install pyclerk`\n - start a Python console: `python3`\n - import pyclerk and create a PyClerk instance: \n\n   ```python\n   import pyclerk\n   pc = pyclerk.PyClerk()\n   json, body = pc.cases.single_case(435800)  # This returns a specific case, with internal id # 435800\n   ```\n- the final command will return two data structures `json` and `body`\n- `json` is the content reply from the Caselaw Access Project API, assuming the API returns a valid status code.  If it doesn't, the appropriate error is raised. This contains case metadata as a json object, with the content of the case as an entry in this structure represented as a bytestring.\n- `body` is the content of the case deparsed to be easier to manipulate in Python.\n\n### Getting More Advanced\n- from there, explore the [docs](https://pyclerk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?) to expand to include new parameters, new types of searches, and more!\n- or, browse the [CAPAPI root](https://api.case.law/v1/) to identify additional functionality that you need for your project.\n- you can also interface directly with the API through PyClerk without using the custom functions or classes:\n```python\nimport pyclerk\npc = pyclerk.PyClerk()\n\n# Write out a custom API Query\ncustom_url = \"https://api.case.law/v1/YOUR CUSTOM REQUEST HERE\"\n# Send that request to CAPAPI and get a text response\nresponse = pc.custom_endpoint.send_request(custom_url)\n# Parse that response into json and a custom body class\njson, body = pc.custom_endpoint.format_response(response)\n```\n### Expanding PyClerk\nPyClerk is still under active development. That means you might find a bug or identify new functionality your project needs. The Caselaw Access Project might also update their API to a new version or change various functionality.\n\n- If you find a bug, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/rgioai/pyclerk/issues).\n- If you need a new feature, you can file a feature request as an issue, or you can go implement it yourself! Just fork the project, add the feature, and submit a pull-request. I'd love some help.\n- If the problem is with the CAPAPI itself, please let them know [here](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples/issues).\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation is super important to this project--the whole goal is ease of use for new coders.  That requires good documentation!\n\nRendered versions of documentation are available through [ReadTheDocs](https://pyclerk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?).  It includes both high-level descriptions and overviews (like the installation and first uses instructions above) and rendered versions of the docstrings that accompany the classes and functions in the package.\n\nTo rebulid the documentation:\n- Generate latest raw API docs: \n\n`sphinx-apidoc -e -o docs/source/api pyclerk`\n\n`sphinx-apidoc -e -o docs/source/api/endpoints pyclerk/endpoint_types`\n\n- Build the docs: `make html`\n\n### Future Growth\n\nThe obvious case for future growth is the inclusion of all available endpoints, such as:\n- bulk\n- citations\n- courts\n- jurisdictions\n- ngrams\n- reporters\n- user_history\n- volumes\n- and any others CAP may choose to unveil.\n\nAdditionally, as we better define the best uses for this kind of data, PyClerk should grow to include pipelines for processing the API data into formats users want most.  This might be in line with some of the sample processing functions I've outlined, or it could be something endusers create that I could never have imagined.\n\nPyClerk will also probably need an update whenever CAP decides to move to v2 of their API. \n\nAreas in the source code ripe for expansion are marked with `#FUTURE`.\n\n",
