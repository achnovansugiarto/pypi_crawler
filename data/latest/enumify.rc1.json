The static mode should be used when you're in environments such as VSCode or PyLint, where they can make use of documentation underneath a particular variable or member. \n\nInteractive mode should be if you are developing or working out of Jupyter Notebook for your enums.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Let's compare two examples.\n\n### Interactive Mode\n\nWith interactive mode, we can not only use the `Member` or `Mem` notation to specify our self-named member, but we can also document that member with an assign:\n\n```python\n@enumify(interactive=True)\nclass DaysOfWeek:\n    MONDAY:Member = \"The first day of the week\"\n    TUESDAY:Member = \"The second day of the week\"\n    WEDNESDAY:Member = \"The third day of the week\"\n```\n\nAnd now these members will have affiliated documentation:\n\n```python\nDaysOfWeek.MONDAY.__doc__\n```\n\n\n\n\n    'The first day of the week'\n\n\n\nWe can even document values that aren't `Member` type by specifying it's documentation last in the assign\n\n```python\n@enumify(interactive=True)\nclass DaysOfWeek:\n    MONDAY:Member = \"The first day of the week\"\n    TUESDAY:int = 0, \"Some number\"\n```\n\n```python\nDaysOfWeek.TUESDAY.__doc__\n```\n\n\n\n\n    'Some number'\n\n\n\n**BUT**, they will *not* have this documentation show when using IDE's such as VSCode. This is where static mode comes in.\n\n### Static Mode\n\nWith static mode, we can still use the `Member` annotation, but we assume that the user will be working out of an IDE and instead rely on how IDE's can annotate variables.\n{% include note.html content='If so, it will be impossible for Jupyter/Notebook users to pick up your documentation for the member' %}\nBelow is our complete `DaysOfWeek` example with this:\n\n```python\n@enumify(interactive=False)\nclass DaysOfWeek:\n    MONDAY:Member\n    \"The first day of the week\"\n    TUESDAY:Member\n    \"The second day of the week\"\n    WEDNESDAY:Member\n    \"The third day of the week\"\n```\n\n```python\nDaysOfWeek.MONDAY\n```\n\n\n\n\n    <DaysOfWeek.MONDAY: 'monday'>\n\n\n\n```python\nassert DaysOfWeek.MONDAY.__doc__ is None\n```\n\n\n",
