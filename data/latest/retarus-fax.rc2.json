    "description": "## Retarus Python Fax SDK\nThe official Python Fax SDK provided by Retarus to contact our messaging services.\n\n## Installation\nInstall from PyPi using pip, a package manager for Python. Minimum python version 3.8.\n\n```bash\npip install retarus-fax\n```\n\nOr you can download the [source code for the Retarus python SDK](https://github.com/retarus/retarus-python-fax) and then build it with following command:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/retarus/retarus-python-fax\ncd retarus-python-fax\npip install .\n```\n\n## Usage\nThe Python SDK implements different services that are offered by Retarus. Each service provides a small variety of examples to get a better understanding of how to use their functionality. The examples can be found in the examples directory sorted by each service. Furthermore, you can check out our OpenAPI documents on the interfaces here: https://developers.retarus.com\n\n### Configuring the SDK\nFirst, you need to configure the SDK with your details.\n```python\nfrom retarus.commons.configuration import Configuration\n\nConfiguration.set_auth(your_user_id, your_password)\nConfiguration.set_region(your_region)\n# if its required for your service (eg. fax)\nConfiguration.customer_number = \"my_customer_number\"\n```\nEach service implements a client, so simply call \"retarus.your_service\" and create a client that provides your functionality.\n\n```python\nfrom retarus.fax.client import FaxClient\n\nsdk = FaxClient(True)\n```\nPlease note that *True* will use the SDK in an asynchronous way while *False* will work in synchronous setup.\n\n### Region\nThe SDK also offers a simple way to select a region where your jobs should be processed. By default the SDK will use the Europe region.\n\nTo configure your region:\n```python\nfrom retarus.commons.configuration import Configuration\nfrom retarus.commons.region import Region\n# if its required for your service (eg. fax)\nConfiguration.set_region(Region.Europe)\n```\n\n### Send a Fax\nTo send a fax, first setup the SDK like described above. For your credentials, we recommend to setup an .env file. It should also contain the customer number. \n> **Please note:** Using the API will only work with valid credentials.\n\nAfter that, you can execute the examples 'send_job_async.py' (for asynchronous processing) or 'send_job_sync.py' (for synchronous processing) with Python. As a result, you should get a message that reports back the ID of the created job.\n\nIn the fax examples folder, you will also find examples on how to retrieve the status of a fax job ID. The examples contain a little documentation on their own.\n\n",
