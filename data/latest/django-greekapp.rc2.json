    "description": "GreekApp\n========\n\nThis is a reusable Django application that allows you to interact with the text of the\nNew Testament in its original language. This is intended for students of Koine\nGreek.\n\nHovering over a Greek word will reveal its meaning and its grammatical\ninformation (gender, tense, mood, person, etc.).\n\nThere's no accounts, nothing like that. It's using Redis as the backend because\nit's blazing fast and very memory efficient.\n\nAll of the text, grammar, lexical data and so is in the public domain.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n1. ``$ pip install django-greekapp``\n2. Add ``greekapp`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n3. Plug GreekApp to your project's ``urls.py``.\n4. Make sure Redis is installed and running\n5. Run the ``load`` management command to load data into Redis\n6. Run the server.\n7. Profit\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nBSD, short and sweet.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/honza/greekapp/raw/master/screenshot.jpg",
