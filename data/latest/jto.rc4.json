Set to `Undefined` by default.\r\n- `name` is the name of the field in original json.\r\n- `required` marked `True` if the field is required in the provided json.\r\n\r\n### Additional rules\r\n- If dataclass field value set to `Undefined` then it will not be converted to json field\r\n- If `to_json` method's argument `drop_nones` set to `True` \r\nthen all dataclass fields with `None` values will not be converted to json field\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nConvert json object to class objects\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\r\nfrom typing import List, Optional\r\n\r\nfrom jto import JTOConverter\r\nfrom jto.undefined_field import Undefined\r\n\r\ndata = {\r\n    \"status\": 200,\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"first\": \"qwer\",\r\n        \"last\": \"qwer\",\r\n        \"test\": [\r\n            {\"f1\": \"1\"},\r\n            {\"f1\": \"2\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Test:\r\n    f1: Optional[str] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'f1', 'required': False})\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Data:\r\n    first: Optional[str] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'first', 'required': False})\r\n    last: Optional[str] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'last', 'required': False})\r\n    test: Optional[List[Test]] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'test', 'required': False})\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Response:\r\n    status: Optional[int] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'status', 'required': False})\r\n    data: Optional[Data] = field(default=Undefined, metadata={'name': 'data', 'required': False})\r\n\r\n\r\ndataclass_object = JTOConverter.from_json(Response, data)\r\nprint(dataclass_object)\r\n\r\ndataclass_object.status = None\r\njson_object = JTOConverter.to_json(dataclass_object, drop_nones=True)\r\nprint(json_object)\r\n```\r\nGet class templates from json object\r\n```python\r\nfrom jto.dataclass_generator import ClassesTemplate\r\n\r\ndata = {\r\n    \"status\": 200,\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"first\": \"qwer\",\r\n        \"last\": \"qwer\",\r\n        \"test\": [\r\n            {\"f1\": \"1\"},\r\n            {\"f1\": \"2\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclasses = ClassesTemplate()\r\nclasses.build_classes('Response', data)\r\nprint(classes)\r\n\r\nclasses_str = classes.build_classes_string()\r\nprint(classes_str)\r\n```\r\n",
