    "description": "PyRocketMQ\n==========\n\n1. Introduce\n------------\n\n1.1 Why another python RocketMQ API ?\n*************************************\n\nCurrently the existing apis are too outdated. For example:\n\n- `The official python API <https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-python>`_, which you can install via ``pip install rocketmq-client-python``, is for RocketMQ 2.0 and below, and does not support PullConsumer.\n- `An unofficial python API written by messense <https://github.com/messense/rocketmq-python>`_, which you can install via ``pip install rocketmq``, wraps the same cpp dynamic libraries as the official API, does not support RocketMQ 4.0+ either.\n- `The official cpp API <https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-cpp>`_ now has v5.0-rc1 version, but does not provide pre-compiled binaries, which means you have to compile the project your self. If you're not familiar bazel tool and cpp class export, it may be a little difficult.\n\n1.2 What's the features of this API ?\n*************************************\n\n- It's developed and tested on RocketMQ 4.0+, so it supports many recent features. For example, custom queue selector when producing messages, custom message selector by tag/sql when consuming messages, etc.\n- It exposes the java API as it is as possible, via `JPype <https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype>`_. You can directly reference the java doc in most cases.\n- The get method of any java class are wrapped as property of the coresponding python class. For example, calling ``msg.getTopic()`` in java is equivalent to calling ``msg.topic`` in python.\n\n2. Installation\n---------------\n\n- Download RocketMQ binary release, for example: https://archive.apache.org/dist/rocketmq/4.3.2/rocketmq-all-4.3.2-bin-release.zip.\n- Extract it to somewhere as you like, for example: /path/to/rocketmq-all-4.3.2-bin-release\n- Install pyrocketmq via pip: ``pip install pyrocketmq``\n- Make sure the jvm is started **BEFORE** you import and use pyrocketmq, for example:\n\n.. code-block::  python\n\n    import jpype\n    import jpype.imports\n    jpype.startJVM(classpath=['/path/to/rocketmq-all-4.3.2-bin-release/lib/*',])\n    from pyrocketmq import *\n    # do something\n    jpype.shutdownJVM()\n\n\n3. QuickStart\n-------------\n\n3.1 Producer\n************\n\n.. code-block::  python\n\n    import json\n    from pyrocketmq.common.message import Message\n    from pyrocketmq.client.producer import Producer, SendStatus\n    pr = Producer('test_producer')\n    pr.setNamesrvAddr('localhost:9876')\n    pr.start()\n    body = json.dumps({'name':'Alice', 'age':1}).encode('utf-8')\n    msg = Message(topic='test_topic', body=body, tags='girl')\n    # send, tcp-like, return sendStatus\n    sr = pr.send(msg)\n    assert(sr.sendStatus == SendStatus.SEND_OK)\n    pr.shutdown()\n\n3.2 PullConsumer\n****************\n\n.. code-block::  python\n\n    import json\n    from pyrocketmq.client.consumer.consumer import PullConsumer, PullStatus\n    cs = PullConsumer('test_pull_consumer')\n    cs.setNamesrvAddr('localhost:9876')\n    topic = 'test_topic'\n    cs.start()\n    # pull messages from each queue\n    mqs = cs.fetchSubscribeMessageQueues(topic)\n    for mq in mqs:\n        ofs = cs.minOffset(mq)\n        pr = cs.pull(mq, subExpression='girl', offset=ofs, maxNums=1)\n        if pr.pullStatus == PullStatus.FOUND:\n            # iterate msg in pull result\n            for msg in pr:\n                print(json.loads(msg.body))\n    cs.shutdown()\n\n3.3 PushConsumer\n****************\n\n.. code-block::  python\n\n    import json\n    import time\n    from typing import List\n    from pyrocketmq.client.consumer.listener import ConsumeConcurrentlyContext, ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus, MessageListenerConcurrently\n    from pyrocketmq.client.consumer.consumer import MessageSelector, PushConsumer\n    from pyrocketmq.common.common import ConsumeFromWhere\n    from pyrocketmq.common.message import MessageExt\n    \n    # subclass MessageListenerConcurrently to write your own consume action\n    class MyMessageListenerConcurrently(MessageListenerConcurrently):\n        def _consumeMessage(self, msgs:List[MessageExt], context:ConsumeConcurrentlyContext) -> ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus:\n            print('Concurrently', context.ackIndex)\n            for msg in msgs:\n                print(json.loads(msg.body))\n            return ConsumeConcurrentlyStatus.CONSUME_SUCCESS\n\n    cs = PushConsumer('test_push_consumer')\n    cs.setNamesrvAddr('localhost:9876')\n    selector = MessageSelector.byTag('girl')\n    ml = MyMessageListenerConcurrently()\n    cs.registerMessageListener(ml)\n    cs.subscribe('test_topic', selector)\n    cs.setConsumeFromWhere(ConsumeFromWhere.CONSUME_FROM_FIRST_OFFSET)\n    cs.start()\n    time.sleep(5)\n    cs.shutdown()\n",
