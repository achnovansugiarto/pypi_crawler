    "description": "k5dstatus\n==========\n\nThe ultimate DIY statusline generator for `i3wm <http://i3wm.org>`__.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\n*k5dstatus is in the early phases of development and will need some\nadjustments to get right. If you use k5dstatus, send me feedback!*\n\nk5dstatus is a statusline generator for i3 that you can use to display\nsystem information you may be interested in. i3 comes with ``i3status``\nwhich has many limitations. It has no plugin interface. It has no\nsupport for events and relies on polling for all its information, which\nmakes it surprisingly heavy on resources. It has a weird config file\nformat that makes it difficult to configure.\n\nOther projects have come along to make up for these weaknesses and many\nof them do a great job. k5dstatus is for users who want a more flexible\nstatusline that can be achieved from editing options in a configuration\nfile but without having to learn a complicated plugin api to create\ncustom statusline entries.\n\nThis is accomplished by allowing users to update the statusline through\ninterprocess communication using\n`DBUS <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>`__. k5dstatus\nexposes a DBUS service that you can use to update the statusline simply\nin pretty much any programming language and from any process (maybe even\nin a cron!).\n\n-  No configuration file is required\n-  Update the statusline from multiple processes\n-  Update the statusline from any language (even from the command line!)\n-  No complicated plugin api to learn\n\n\nRelation to i3-dstatus\n----------------------\n\nThis project is a source fork and rewrite of i3-dstatus. It does not attempt to\nmaintain compatibility or upstream pairing.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nk5dstatus is on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/k5dstatus>`__.\n\n::\n\n    pip install k5dstatus\n\nYou'll also need ``python-gobject`` and ``python-dbus`` from your package\nmanager.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUse k5dstatus as your status command in your bar block like so:\n\n::\n    \n    bar {\n        status_command k5dstatus clock\n    }\n\nConfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGenerator scripts will look for ``~/.k5dstatus.conf`` for configuration\noptions. See ``k5dstatus.conf`` in the repo for an example. The\nconfiguration file should be a single YAML object. (More documentation\nto come).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease report bugs, request feature, write documentation, and add\ngenerators to the ``k5dstatus/generators`` directory. k5dstatus is a community\nproject so feedback is welcome!\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis work is available under a FreeBSD License (see LICENSE).\n\nCopyright Â© 2015, James Bliss\n\nAll rights reserved.",
