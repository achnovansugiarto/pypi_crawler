    "description": "# FaRoC (Fanuc Robot Control)\n\n## Overview\nA Python library for communication with Fanuc robots. \nIt can read data from the controller, write data to the controller, execute TP and Karel program, and move the robot.\n\n\n## Functionality and features \nFaRoC is based on two works: \n\n  - fanucpy: Python package for FANUC industrial robots (https://github.com/torayeff/fanucpy)\n  - Fanuc DPM Mouse Demo (https://github.com/gavanderhoorn/fanuc_dpm_mouse_demo)\n\n\nFanucpy uses ASCII data transfer, whereas FaRoC uses BINARY data transfer for these reasons:\n\n\nQuote from KAREL Reference Manual: \n\n\"Binary I/O is preferred to text I/O when creating files that are to be read only by KAREL programs for the following reasons:\n\n - Positional, VECTOR, and PATH variables cannot be read directly from text input.\n - Some formats and data combinations are not read in the same manner as they were written in text files or they become invalid if read with the same format.\n  - Binary data is generally more compact, reducing both the file size and the I/O time.\n  - There is some inevitable loss of precision when converting from REAL data to its ASCII\nrepresentation and back.\n\nGenerally, no format specifiers need to be used with binary I/O. If this rule is followed, all input data can\nbe read exactly as it was before it was written.\"\n\nFanucpy has these functionalities so far:\n\n  | Attribute | Funktion |\n  |---|---|\n  | Current joint values (JOINTPOS)   | GET |\n  | Current pose (XYZWPR, without config)         | GET |\n  | TP Program                        | START (CALL) |\n  | Move Robot to a given JOINTPOS <br />- use CALL Program | START\n  | Move Robot to a given XYZWPR <br />- use CALL Program | START\n  | I/O -> Robot OUT (RO)             | GET, SET |\n  | Instantaneous power consumption   | GET |\n  \n  \nFaRoC provides the functionalities described in fanucpy and extends them by further functions:\n\n  | Attribute | Funktion |\n  |---|---|\n  | Current joint values (JOINTPOS)   | GET |\n  | Current pose (XYZWPR and config)         | GET |\n  | External Program (KAREL or TP)             | START, ABORT,<br /> GET TYPE, CHECK STATUS, GET TASK INFO |\n  | Move Robot to a given JOINTPOS <br />- use RUN or CALL Program <br />- change one or more joint values | START, ABORT\n  | Move Robot to a given XYZWPR <br />- use RUN or CALL Program<br />- change one or more pose values | START, ABORT\n  | I/O -> Robot OUT (RO)             | GET, SET |\n  | I/O -> SIUMLATED Robot IN (RI)    | GET |\n  | System variables <br />- supported types: REAL, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTE, SHORT and STRING  | GET, SET, GET TYPE |\n  | Program variables <br />- supported types: REAL, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTE, SHORT and STRING | GET, SET, GET TYPE |\n  | Robot USER or TOOL frame                              | GET, SET |\n  | number of the used USER or TOOL frame     | GET, SET |\n  | KAREL internal USER or TOOL frame              | GET, SET |\n  | I/O -> Flag                       | GET, SET |\n  | DATA Regsiter ( R )               | GET, SET |\n  | Comment for DATA Regsiter         | GET, SET |\n  | DATA String Regsiter (SR)         | GET, SET |\n  | Comment for DATA String Regsiter  | GET, SET |\n  | Position Regsiter (PR)            | GET, SET, GET TYPE |\n  | Pose (XYZWPR)                     | IS REACHABLE, CONVERT TO JOINTPOS |\n  | Joint values (JOINTPOS)           | IS REACHABLE, CONVERT TO XYZWPR |\n  | RSI                               | ENABLE, DISABLE, IS ENABLE |\n  | Robot Time                        | GET, SET |\n  | Fanuc alarm code / KAREL status  | Provide error details |\n  \n  \nTo provide Fanuc alarm code / KAREL status details, data has been extracted from the FANUC manual: \nOPERATOR'S MANUAL (Alarm Code List) | R-30+B CONTROLLER | B-83284EN-1/02.\n\n\n## Software contents\nThe package consists of two parts: \n\n1. Robot interface code written in Python programming language\n2. FANUC robot controller driver (tested with R-30iB Controller) written in KAREL and FANUC teach pendant languages\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following is needed for FaRoC software to work:\n -  Roboguide or physical robot\n - R-30iB controller (`V8.xx` and up), with:\n   - `R648` - User Socket Msg\n - Python `>= 3.6`\n\n\n## Build\nYou can use the command line OR Roboguide to build the *.kl files \n\n### Command line\n\nIf `ktrans.exe` is not installed in the default location (ie:\n`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Fanuc\\WinOLPC\\bin`),\n\nopen `build.cmd` from `src` -> `fanuc-driver` and update the `KTRANS_BIN` variable. If `ktrans.exe` is on\nthe Windows `PATH`, simply setting it to `ktrans.exe` should also work.\n\nIf you need to build for a runtime software version other than `V8.30`,\nchange `CORE_VERSION` as well.\n\nNow run `build.cmd` in a command shell. Six p-code files should be created\n\n### Roboguide\nOpen `build.cmd` from `src` -> `fanuc-driver`.\nAdd all Karel programs listed in `build.cmd` and the three TP programs (`*.ls` files) to your Roboguide\nworkcell and build them.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nRoboguide should have automatically uploaded the Karel programs to the virtual\ncontroller. Loading the TP program should copy it as well.\n\nIf `build.cmd` was used, add the `.pc` and `.ls` files to the project and\nload them onto the virtual controller. Alternatively an FTP client could be\nused.\n\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Host Comm (SERVER)\n\nSetup two *Server Tags*, Nr. 7 & 8, to use the `SM` protocol and make sure to set\n`Startup State` to `START`. Use the `[ACTION]` menu to start the Tag\nimmediately, or restart the controller. The SETUP Server config can be found in MENU -> SETUP -> Host Comm. -> SHOW -> Servers.\n\n\n### FaRoC_SERVER\nOpen the *KAREL Vars* on the controller for `FaRoC_SERVER` (after selecting it, i.e. SELECT -> FaRoC_Server -> ENTER -> MENU -> DATA -> KAREL Vars), switch to the `cfg_` field, open the\nstructure and enter the following values:\n\n```\nS_TCP_PORT   : 24087\nS_TAG_NR     : 7\nUM_CLEAR     : TRUE\n```\n\n\n### Configure the rest automatically\n\nNow you can start the TP program `FAROC`. On the computer initialize an object of class `FaRoC_Writer` and connect it to the server. \nThe rest of the configuration can be done with the script `demo_FaRoC_setup.py`. \n\nFinally, you will have to restart the controller to apply the changes. \n\n\nOtherwise you can do it manually as follows:\n\n\n### Configure the rest manually\n\n\n#### FaRoC_MOVER\nOpen the *KAREL Vars* for `FaRoC_MOVER`, switch to the `cfg_` field, open the\nstructure and enter the following values:\n\n```\nS_TCP_PORT   : 24088\nS_TAG_NR     : 8\nUM_CLEAR     : FALSE\nUFRAM_NUM    : 1\nUTOOL_NUM    : 1\n```\n\n#### Host Comm (CLIENT)\n\nIn order to use `FaRoC_dclnt1` set up a *Client Tags*, e.g. No. 1 to use the `SM` protocol and \nmake sure the `Startup State` is set to `START`. \nSet `Server IP/Hostname` to the ip adress of the pc you want to use for socket messaging, e.g. `127.0.0.1` in case of Roboguide.\nUse the `[ACTION]` menu to start the Tag immediately, or restart the controller. \n\nWe use binary data transfare, so we need to set the system variable`$HOSTC_CFG[1].$USE_UDP` to `TRUE` \n\n\nA *cleint tag* is configured for each data client. You can configure up to 8 data clients if required.\n Each client can send up to 32 variables. \nIf more data is needed simultaneously, new Data Clients (Karel programme) can simply be copied (the programme name must be changed in the file) and new 'client tags' can be configured as above.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe author of this software is not affiliated with FANUC Corporation in any way.\nAll trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners, and company, product and service names mentioned in this readme or appearing in source code or other artefacts in this repository are used for identification purposes only.\nUse of these names does not imply endorsement by FANUC Corporation.\n\n\n## References\n\nBelow is a list of resources that have been used as reference and inspiration for the development of FaRoc.\n\n- [fanucpy](https://github.com/torayeff/fanucpy): Python package for FANUC industrial robots\n- [Fanuc DPM Mouse Demo](https://github.com/gavanderhoorn/fanuc_dpm_mouse_demo)\n- OPERATOR'S MANUAL (Alarm Code List) | R-30+B CONTROLLER | B-83284EN-1/02\n",
