    "description": "# anomatools\n\n`anomatools` is a small Python package containing recent **anomaly detection algorithms**.\nAnomaly detection strives to detect _abnormal_ or _anomalous_ data points from a given (large) dataset.\nThe package contains several state-of-the-art semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package directly from PyPi with the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install anomatools\n```\n\nOR install the package using the `setup.py` file:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nOR install it directly from GitHub itself:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/Vincent-Vercruyssen/anomatools.git@master\n```\n\n## Contents and usage\n\n### Semi-supervised anomaly detection\n\nGiven a dataset with attributes **X** and labels _Y_, indicating whether a data point is _normal_ or _anomalous_, semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms are trained using all the instances **X** and some of the labels _Y_.\nSemi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection generally outperform the unsupervised approaches, because they can use the label information to correct the assumptions on which the unsupervised detection process is based.\nThe `anomatools` package implements two recent semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms:\n\n1. The **SSDO** (_semi-supervised detection of outliers_) algorithm first computes an unsupervised prior anomaly score and then corrects this score with the known label information [1].\n2. The **SSkNNO** (_semi-supervised k-nearest neighbor anomaly detection_) algorithm is a combination of the well-known _kNN_ classifier and the _kNNO_ (k-nearest neighbor outlier detection) method [2].\n\nGiven a training dataset **X_train** with labels _Y_train_, and a test dataset **X_test**, the algorithms are applied as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom anomatools.models import SSkNNO, SSDO\n\n# train\ndetector = SSDO()\ndetector.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# predict\nlabels = detector.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nSimilarly, the probability of each point in **X_test** being normal or anomalous can also be computed:\n\n```python\nprobabilities = detector.predict_proba(X_test, method='squash')\n```\n\nSometimes we are interested in detecting anomalies in the training data (e.g., when we are doing a post-mortem analysis):\n\n```python\n# train\ndetector = SSDO()\ndetector.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# predict\nlabels = detector.labels_\n\n```\n\n### Unsupervised anomaly detection:\n\nUnsupervised anomaly detectors do not make use of label information (user feedback) when detecting anomalies in a dataset. Given a dataset with attributes **X** and labels _Y_, the unsupervised detectors are trained using only **X**.\nThe `anomatools` package implements two recent semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms:\n\n1. The **kNNO** (_k-nearest neighbor outlier detection_) algorithm computes for each data point the anomaly score as the distance to its k-nearest neighbor in the dataset [[3](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335437)].\n2. The **iNNE** (_isolation nearest neighbor ensembles_) algorithm computes for each data point the anomaly score roughly based on how isolation the point is from the rest of the data [[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/coin.12156)].\n\nGiven a training dataset **X_train** with labels _Y_train_, and a test dataset **X_test**, the algorithms are applied as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom anomatools.models import kNNO, iNNE\n\n# train\ndetector = kNNO()\ndetector.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# predict\nlabels = detector.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n## Package structure\n\nThe anomaly detection algorithms are located in: `anomatools/models/`\n\nFor further examples of how to use the algorithms see the notebooks: `anomatools/notebooks/`\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe `anomatools` package requires the following python packages to be installed:\n\n- [Python 3](http://www.python.org)\n- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)\n- [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org)\n- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n\n## Contact\n\nContact the author of the package: [vincent.vercruyssen@kuleuven.be](mailto:vincent.vercruyssen@kuleuven.be)\n\n## References\n\n[1] Vercruyssen, V., Meert, W., Verbruggen, G., Maes, K., BÃ¤umer, R., Davis, J.
