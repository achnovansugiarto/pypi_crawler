    "description": "I needed a console friendly tool to print dates, so I made one, basing it\non python-dateutil. Here is the output of --help:\n\nNAME\n    dates - prints a list of dates\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    dates [OPTIONS]\n\nOPTIONS\n    --help:\n        Print this help\n\n    --freq <frequency>:\n        Choose frequency (values admitted: YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY,\n        DAILY). Defaults to DAILY.\n\n    --from, --dtstart:\n        Recurrence start\n\n    --to, --until:\n        limit of the recurrence\n\n    --step, --interval:\n        The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using\n        YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years.\n\n    --wkst:\n        The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an\n        integer, specifying the first day of the week.\n\n    --count:\n        How many occurrences will be generated.\n\n    --byweekday:\n        If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of\n        integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a\n        sequence of these constants. When given, these variables will\n        define the weekdays where the recurrence will be applied.\n\n    --bysetpos:\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an\n        occurrence number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule\n        inside the frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if\n        combined with a MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE,\n        TH, FR), will result in the last work day of every month. )\n\n    --bymonth:\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        meaning the months to apply the recurrence to.\n\n    --bymonthday:\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to.\n\n    --byyearday:\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to.\n\n    --byweekno:\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers\n        have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of\n        the year is that containing at least four days of the new year.\n\n    --byweekday:\n        If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO) or a sequence of\n        integers. When given, these variables will define the weekdays\n        where the recurrence will be applied.\n\n    --byeaster\n        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,\n        positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the\n        Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the\n        Easter Sunday itself.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n    Prints the Mondays and Tuesdays that occur every 5 days in 2010:\n    dates --from 2010-01-01 --to 2011-01-01 --step 5 --byweekday '[\"MO\",\"TU\"]'\n\n    Prints the last friday of each month of 2010:\n    dates --freq MONTHLY --from 2010-01-01 --to 2011-01-01 --byweekday 'FR(-1)'",
