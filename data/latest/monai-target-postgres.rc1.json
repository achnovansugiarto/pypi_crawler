Add `libpq` dependency\n\n```sh\n# macos\nbrew install postgresql\n```\n```sh\n# ubuntu\nsudo apt install libpq-dev\n```\n\n1. install `singer-target-postgres`\n\n```sh\npip install singer-target-postgres\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Follow the\n   [Singer.io Best Practices](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/RUNNING_AND_DEVELOPING.md#running-a-singer-tap-with-a-singer-target)\n   for setting up separate `tap` and `target` virtualenvs to avoid version\n   conflicts.\n\n1. Create a [config file](#configjson) at\n   `~/singer.io/target_postgres_config.json` with postgres connection\n   information and target postgres schema.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"postgres_host\": \"localhost\",\n     \"postgres_port\": 5432,\n     \"postgres_database\": \"my_analytics\",\n     \"postgres_username\": \"myuser\",\n     \"postgres_password\": \"1234\",\n     \"postgres_schema\": \"mytapname\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Run `target-postgres` against a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap.\n\n   ```bash\n   ~/.virtualenvs/tap-something/bin/tap-something \\\n     | ~/.virtualenvs/target-postgres/bin/target-postgres \\\n       --config ~/singer.io/target_postgres_config.json >> state.json\n   ```\n\n   If you are running windows, the following is equivalent:\n\n   ```\n   venvs\\tap-exchangeratesapi\\Scripts\\tap-exchangeratesapi.exe | ^\n   venvs\\target-postgresql\\Scripts\\target-postgres.exe ^\n   --config target_postgres_config.json\n   ```\n\n###

Our [CI config](https://github.com/datamill-co/target-postgres/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) defines all versions we are currently supporting.\n\n| Version | Current minor | Supported | First Release      | Final Release     |\n| ------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |\n| 12      | 12.2          | Yes       | October 3, 2019    | November 14, 2024 |\n| 11      | 11.7          | Yes       | October 18, 2018   | November 9, 2023  |\n| 10      | 10.12         | Yes       | October 5, 2017    | November 10, 2022 |\n| 9.6     | 9.6.17       | Yes       | September 29, 2016 | November 11, 2021 |\n| 9.5     | 9.5.21        | Yes       | January 7, 2016    | February 11, 2021 |\n| 9.4     | 9.4.26        | Yes       | December 18, 2014  | February 13, 2020 |\n| 9.3     | 9.3.25        | No        | September 9, 2013  | November 8, 2018  |\n\n_The above is copied from the [current list of versions](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) on Postgresql.org_\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- Requires a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for every stream.\n- Only string, string with date-time format, integer, number, boolean,\n  object, and array types with or without null are supported. Arrays can\n  have any of the other types listed, including objects as types within\n  items.\n  - Example of JSON Schema types that work\n    - `['number']`\n    - `['string']`\n    - `['string', 'null']`\n  - Exmaple of JSON Schema types that **DO NOT** work\n    - `['string', 'integer']`\n    - `['integer', 'number']`\n    - `['any']`\n    - `['null']`\n- JSON Schema combinations such as `anyOf` and `oneOf` are not supported.\n- JSON Schema \\$ref is partially supported:\n  - **_NOTE:_** The following limitations are known to **NOT** fail gracefully\n  - Presently you cannot have any circular or recursive `$ref`s\n  - `$ref`s must be present within the schema:\n    - URI's do not work\n    - if the `$ref` is broken, the behaviour is considered unexpected\n- Any values which are the `string` `NULL` will be streamed to PostgreSQL as the literal `null`\n- Table names are restricted to:\n  - 63 characters in length\n  - can only be composed of `_`, lowercase letters, numbers, `$`\n  - cannot start with `$`\n  - ASCII characters\n- Field/Column names are restricted to:\n  - 63 characters in length\n  - ASCII characters\n\n## Indexes\n\nIf the `add_upsert_indexes` config option is enabled, which it is by default, `target-postgres` adds indexes on the tables it creates for its own queries to be more performant. Specifically, `target-postgres` automatically adds indexes to the `_sdc_sequence` column and the `_sdc_level_<n>_id` columns which are used heavily when inserting and upserting.\n\n`target-postgres` doesn't have any facilities for adding other indexes to the managed tables, so if there are more indexes required, they should be added by another downstream tool, or can just be added by an administrator when necessary. Note that these indexes incur performance overhead to maintain as data is inserted, These indexes can also prevent `target-postgres` from dropping columns in the future if the schema of the table changes, in which case an administrator should drop the index so `target-postgres` is able to drop the columns it needs to.\n\n**Note**: Index adding is new as of version `0.2.1`, and `target-postgres` does not retroactively create indexes for tables it created before that time. If you want to add indexes to older tables `target-postgres` is loading data into, they should be added manually.\n\n## Usage Logging\n\n[Singer.io](https://www.singer.io/) requires official taps and targets to collect anonymous usage data. This data is only used in aggregate to report on individual tap/targets, as well as the Singer community at-large. IP addresses are recorded to detect unique tap/targets users but not shared with third-parties.\n\nTo disable anonymous data collection set `disable_collection` to `true` in the configuration JSON file.\n\n## Developing\n\n`target-postgres` utilizes [setup.py](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for package\nmanagement, and [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) for testing.\n\n### Documentation\n\nSee also:\n\n- [DECISIONS](./DECISIONS.md): A document containing high level explanations of various decisions and decision making paradigms. A good place to request more explanation/clarification on confusing things found herein.\n- [TableMetadata](./docs/TableMetadata.md): A document detailing some of the metadata necessary for `TargetPostgres` to function correctly on the Remote\n\n### Docker\n\nIf you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed, you can\neasily run the following to get a local env setup quickly.\n\n```sh\n$ docker-compose up -d --build\n$ docker logs -tf target-postgres_target-postgres_1 # You container names might differ\n```\n\nAs soon as you see `INFO: Dev environment ready.` you can shell into the container and start running test commands:\n\n```sh\n$ docker-compose exec target-postgres bash\n(target-postgres) root@...:/code# pytest\n```\n\nThe environment inside the docker container has a virtualenv set up and activated, with an `--editable` install of `target-postgres` inside it and your local code mounted as a Docker volume. If you make changes on your host and re-run `pytest` any changes should be reflected inside the container.\n\nSee the [PyTest](#pytest) commands below!\n\n### DB\n\nTo run the tests, you will need a PostgreSQL server running.\n\n**_NOTE:_** Testing assumes that you've exposed the traditional port `5432`.\n\nMake sure to set the following env vars for [PyTest](#pytest):\n\n```sh\n$ EXPORT POSTGRES_HOST='<your-host-name>' # Most likely 'localhost'\n$ EXPORT POSTGRES_DB='<your-db-name>'     # We use 'target_postgres_test'\n$ EXPORT POSTGRES_USER='<your-user-name'  # Probably just 'postgres', make sure this user has no auth\n```\n\n### PyTest\n\nTo run tests, try:\n\n```sh\n$ python setup.py pytest\n```\n\nIf you've `bash` shelled into the Docker Compose container ([see above](#docker)), you should be able to simply use:\n\n```sh\n$ pytest\n```\n\n## Collaboration and Contributions\n\nJoin the conversation over at the [Singer.io Slack](singer-io.slack.com) and on the `#target-postgres` channel.\n\nTry to adhere to the following for contributing:\n\n- File New Issue -> Fork -> New Branch(If needed) -> Pull Request -> Approval -> Merge\n\nUsers can file an issue without submitting a pull request but be aware not all issues can or will be addressed.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nTarget Postgres is sponsored by Data Mill (Data Mill Services, LLC) [datamill.co](https://datamill.co/).\n\nData Mill helps organizations utilize modern data infrastructure and data science to power analytics, products, and services.\n\n---\n\nCopyright Data Mill Services, LLC 2018\n\n\n",
