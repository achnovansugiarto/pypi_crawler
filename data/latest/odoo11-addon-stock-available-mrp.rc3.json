This feature was present in the standard computations too until v8.0, but it has been dropped from the standard from v8.0 on.\nFor the sake of consistency the potential quantity is now always reported in the product's main Unit of Measure too.\n\nRoadmap\n-------\nPossible improvements for future versions:\n* take manufacturing delays into account: we should not promise goods to customers if they want them delivered earlier that we can make them\n* Compute the quantity of finished product that can be made directly on each Bill of Material: this would be useful for production managers, and may make the computations faster by avoiding to compute the same BoM several times when several variants share the same BoM\n* add an option (probably as a sub-module) to consider all raw materials as available if they can be bought from the suppliers in time for the manufacturing.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.
