Loggers should be placed in as many rooms as possible and the mean taken across all rooms.\n\n\\*\\* A single logger should be placed outside the dwelling within a [Stevenson screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson_screen) to shield it from direct sunlight.\n\nFor more info on the physical setup of sensors, see the [guidance](#sensor-placement-guidance).\n\nFrom these data the model produces an estimate of the HTC of the building, as would be found by performing a co-heating test. The model itself is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks built with Tensorflow.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with pip:\n```\npip install pysmeter\n```\n\nIt is recommended that you use a virtual env. Python >= 3.6 ships with venv in the standard library, so you can do:\n```\npython3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n```\n```\ncd /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n```\n```\nsource bin/activate\n```\n```\npip install pysmeter\n```\n\nThe install does not include the model files themselves, as they are very large (~300MB). These need to be downloaded separately after installation:\n```\npython3 -m pysmeter.download_model\n```\n\nThis downloads the model files to `/usr/share/smeter-models` (Linux) or `/usr/local/share/smeter-models` (Mac).\nYou may need to run this command as root.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Python module\n\nIt is generally expected that you will use pysmeter within an existing Python project. The package exposes a single function, `pysmeter.model.predict`, which makes an HTC prediction based on the input array. The input array can be either two-dimensional (if there is only one building) or three-dimensional (more than one building). The dimensions are:\n\n - [_number of houses_ x] _timesteps_ x _channels_\n\nThere are always four channels: indoor temp, outdoor temp, gas, elec.\n\nThe number of timesteps should be at least 1008 (i.e. 3 weeks worth of half hours). The current model does not work with variable length input, but there are two versions of the model, one which has been trained on 3 weeks of data and one which has been trained on 4 weeks of data. If the supplied input array contains between 3 and 4 weeks of data then it will be truncated down to the first three weeks. If the supplied input array contains more than 4 weeks of data then it will be truncated down to the first four weeks.\n\nThe predict function returns a list of predictions for each of the datasets it is given, where each prediction is a tuple containing the prediction itself, the lower bound and the upper bound.\n\n```python\nimport pysmeter.model as smeter\n\nX = <code to make input array>\n\n# Make the predictions\npredictions = smeter.predict(X)\n\nfor htc, lower, upper in predictions:\n    print(f\"HTC: {htc} | Lower bound: {lower} | Upper bound: {upper}\")\n```\n\nHere is a more illustrative example where we assume that we have two buildings whose data series are stored in the files `data1.csv` and `data2.csv`, where the csv files have headers `indoor, outdoor, gas, elec`.\n```python\nimport csv\nimport numpy as np\nimport pysmeter.model as smeter\n\ndef _read_data(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Reads data from file and returns 4 lists containing the data for each channel.\"\"\"\n    indoor, outdoor, gas, elec = [], [], [], []\n\n    with open(file_path) as f:\n        reader = csv.DictReader(f)\n        for row in reader:\n            indoor.append(float(row[\"indoor\"]))\n            outdoor.append(float(row[\"outdoor\"]))\n            gas.append(float(row[\"gas\"]))\n            elec.append(float(row[\"elec\"]))\n\n    return indoor, outdoor, gas, elec\n\nx1 = _read_data(\"data1.csv\")\nx2 = _read_data(\"data2.csv\")\n\n# Put the data into a numpy array and make it the right shape\nX = np.array([x1, x2]).transpose((0, 2, 1))\n\n# Make the predictions\npredictions = smeter.predict(X)\n\nfor htc, lower, upper in predictions:\n    print(f\"HTC: {htc} | Lower bound: {lower} | Upper bound: {upper}\")\n```\n\n### CLI\n\nThere is also a command line interface to the progamme which lets you run the SMETER model on data from a csv file.\n\nThe csv file must have four columns with readings for each of the four channels (average indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, gas kWh, elec kWh).\n\nIt will be assumed that each row corresponds to a single datetime and that time entries are 30 min apart.\nIf a datetime column is present, it will do no harm, but it will be ignored by the program.\n\nThe expected column names are: `indoor, outdoor, gas, elec`.\n\nThey can be in any order. If your csv has different column names you can declare them using the -i, -o, -g, -e options\n(see example below).\n\nSimple usage:\n\n    pysmeter /path/to/csv/file.csv\n\nWith optional csv column headers:\n\n    pysmeter /path/to/csv/file.csv -i 'Indoor temperature' -o 'Outdoor temperature'\n    pysmeter /path/to/csv/file.csv -g 'Gas'\n    pysmeter /path/to/csv/file.csv -e 'Electricity Usage (kWh)'\n\n\n## Sensor placement guidance\n\nWhen placing the temperature sensors in the dwelling, it is important to adhere to the following guidance. Failure to do so will affect the accuracy of the HTC prediction.\n\n- Temperature sensors should be placed in as many rooms of the house as is feasible. The stairwell/landing can be considered to be a single room as it is one continuous thermal zone.\n- The ideal sensor position is the exact centre of the room, although this is likely to be impossible in most cases. The next best place is halfway up a wall, or placed on a bookcase, say.\n- Sensors should not be placed near windows, sources of heat or in places where they will receive direct sunlight. They should also not be placed in places where they are likely to be moved, knocked off a perch or mistaken for a toy by children.\n- It is recommended that you number each of the sensors, either with a sticker or with permanent marker, and make a map of the house showing all the sensor locations.\n- The outside sensor can be placed anywhere close to the house, e.g. the front or back garden. It _must_ be placed within a Stevenson screen to shield it from direct sunlight.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, see [https://smeter.cse.org.uk/guidance](https://smeter.cse.org.uk/guidance). We have also provided a template for noting sensor placement in MS Word format at [https://smeter.cse.org.uk/guidance/SMETER-sensor-placement-template.docx](https://smeter.cse.org.uk/guidance/SMETER-sensor-placement-template.docx).\n\n\n",
