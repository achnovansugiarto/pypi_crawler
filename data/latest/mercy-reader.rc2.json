Below is an example:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Mercury Goes Open Source! â€” Postlight â€” Digital product studio\",\n  \"author\": \"Adam Pash\",\n  \"date_published\": \"2019-02-06T14:36:45.000Z\",\n  \"dek\": null,\n  \"lead_image_url\": \"https://postlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mercury-open-source-social-card-e1550670446269.png\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"html\": \"<div class=\\\"body__content\\\"> <p>It&#x2019;s my pleasure to announce that today, Postlight is open-sourcing the <a href=\\\"https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/\\\">Mercury Web Parser</a>.</p>\\n<p>Written in JavaScript and running on both Node and in the browser, Mercury Parser is the engine that powers the Mercury Parser API, <a href=\\\"https://mercury.postlight.com/amp-converter/\\\">Mercury AMP Converter</a>, <a href=\\\"https://mercury.postlight.com/reader/\\\">Mercury Reader</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://postlight.com/trackchanges/the-secret-engines-of-the-internet\\\">even more third-party software and services.</a></p>\\n<p>Mercury Parser allows for better reading experiences, easier content migration, and endless opportunities for remixing the web, by making semantic sense out of any article.
