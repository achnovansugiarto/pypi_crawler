That doesn’t mean\n    Plone is hard for everything! This is a simple tutorial that anyone can\n    follow to get a simple Todo list application running inside of Plone.\n    Would you want to deploy Plone for just a Todo list in real life? Probably\n    not. You can however learn several simple, fast concepts that will get you\n    most of the way there. Feeling like you don’t understand something\n    completely or the terminology is getting to you? Sit back, relax, and finish\n    the tutorial. If in the end things still aren’t clear, please give feedback\n    and we’ll look at what we could do better.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n1.0 (2012-09-11)\n----------------\n\n- Acted as guinea pigs and went through the entire tutorial slowly and\n  thoroughly.\n  [matejc, plamut]\n\n- AJAXifying the @@todo view.\n  [eleddy]\n\n- The @@todo BrowserView for listing Todo Items.\n  [zupo]\n\n- Tests for GenericSetup exports of content-type and workflow.\n  [zupo]\n\n- TTW part of the tutorial, loads of screenshots.\n  [eleddy]\n\n- Skeleton.\n  [zupo]\n\nLicense (3-clause BSD)\n======================\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, Caipirinha Sprinters.
