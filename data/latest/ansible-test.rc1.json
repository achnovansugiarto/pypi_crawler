    "description": "ansible-test: Ansible Local Testing Framework\n=============================================\n\nAnsible-test is a tool for testing your automation on local docker images. You can think of this as a slim version of Chef's test-kitchen\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ cd /my/ansible/repository\n   $ ansible-test my_ansible_role\n\nThe above command will drop a Dockerfile at the root of your ansible repo and initialize a docker image with ansible installed. It will then run the ansible role \"my_ansible_role\".\n\nNote that ansible-test also accepts arbitrary arguments. These arguments will be passed onto the ansible-playbook command while running tests.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install ansible-test:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ pip install ansible-test\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nansible-test requires that you have docker installed locally. If you are using Mac OSX, I reccommend you use boot2docker.\n\nNOTE: Given docker's inflexibility with Dockerfiles, ansible-test will overwrite the file Dockerfile at the current working directory from which you run ansible-test. This is currently the simplest way to integrate docker as a testing tool.\n",
