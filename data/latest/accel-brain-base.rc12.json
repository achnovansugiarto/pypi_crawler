    "description": "# Deep Learning Library: accel-brain-base.\r\n\r\n`accel-brain-base` is a basic library of the Deep Learning for rapid development at low cost. This library makes it possible to design and implement deep learning, which must be configured as a complex system or a System of Systems, by combining a plurality of functionally differentiated modules such as a **Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM)**, **Deep Boltzmann Machines(DBMs)**, a **Stacked-Auto-Encoder**, an **Encoder/Decoder based on Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)**, and a **Convolutional Auto-Encoder(CAE)**.\r\n\r\nFrom the view points of functionally equivalents and structural expansions, this library also prototypes many variants such as energy-based models and Generative models. Typical examples are **Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)** and **Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs)**.\r\n\r\nIt also supports the implementation of **Semi-Supervised Learning** and **Self-Supervised Learning**, which consists of a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning systems. This library dryly considers the various Transformers variants such as **BERT**, **XLNet**, **RoBERTa**, **ALBERT**, etc, are merely applications of **Self-Supervised Learning** or **Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation(SSDA)**. From this point of view, this class builds the Transformers variants as SSDA models.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this library provides **Deep Reinforcement Learning** such as **Deep Q-Networks** that applies the neural network described above as a function approximator. In principle, any neural network described above can be implemented as a function approximator.\r\n\r\nSee also ...\r\n\r\n- [Automatic Summarization Library: pysummarization](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Automatic-Summarization)\r\n   * If you want to implement the **Sequence-to-Sequence(Seq2Seq) model** for the automatic summarization by using `accel-brain-base` to build the **Encoder/Decoder controllers**, **Attention models**, or **Transformer models**.\r\n- [Reinforcement Learning Library: pyqlearning](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning)\r\n    * If you want to implement the Deep Reinforcement Learning, especially for **Deep Q-Network** and **Multi-agent Deep Q-Network** by using `accel-brain-base` as a Function Approximator.\r\n- [Generative Adversarial Networks Library: pygan](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Generative-Adversarial-Networks)\r\n    * If you want to implement **Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)** and **Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs)** by using `accel-brain-base` as components for Generative models based on the Statistical machine learning problems.\r\n- [Algorithmic Composition or Automatic Composition Library: pycomposer](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Algorithmic-Composition)\r\n   * If you want to implement the Algorithmic Composer based on **Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)** by using `accel-brain-base` as components for Generative models based on the Statistical machine learning problems.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall using pip:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npip install accel-brain-base\r\n```\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\r\npip install dist/accel_brain_base-*.*.*-py3-*-*.whl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub.\r\n\r\n- [accel-brain-code/Accel-Brain-Base](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Accel-Brain-Base)\r\n\r\n### Python package index(PyPI)\r\n\r\nInstallers for the latest released version are available at the Python package index.\r\n\r\n- [accel-brain-base : Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/accel-brain-base/)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy): v1.13.3 or higher.\r\n- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas): v0.22.0 or higher.\r\n- [mxnet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) or [mxnet-cu*](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/tutorials/getting-started/crash-course/6-use_gpus.html): latest.\r\n  * Only when building a model of this library using [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/).\r\n- [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)\r\n  * Only when building a model of this library using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).\r\n\r\n#### For ML Ops.\r\n\r\nIn the [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) version of this library, almost all models inherit [HybridBlock](https://gluon.mxnet.io/chapter07_distributed-learning/hybridize.html) from [mxnet.gluon](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/index.html).

Check the official documentation for the information you need.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nFull documentation is available on [https://code.accel-brain.com/Accel-Brain-Base/README.html](https://code.accel-brain.com/Accel-Brain-Base/README.html). This document contains information on functionally reusability, functional scalability and functional extensibility.\r\n\r\n## Problem Setting: Deep Learning after the era of \"Democratization of Artificial Intelligence(AI)\".\r\n\r\nHow the Research and Development(R&D) on the subject of machine learning including deep learning, after the era of \"Democratization of Artificial Intelligence(AI)\", can become possible? Simply implementing the models and algorithms provided by standard machine learning libraries and applications like AutoML would reinvent the wheel. If you just copy and paste the demo code from the library and use it, your R&D would fall into dogmatically authoritarian development, or so-called the Hype driven development.\r\n\r\nIf you fall in love with the concept of \"Democratization of AI,\" you may forget the reality that the R&D is under the influence of not only democracy but also capitalism. The R&D provides economic value when its R&D artifacts are distinguished from the models and algorithms realized by standard machine learning libraries and applications such as AutoML. In general terms, R&D must provide a differentiator to maximize the scarcity of its implementation artifacts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be remembered that any R&D builds on the history of the social structure and the semantics of the concepts envisioned by previous studies. Many models and algorithms are variants derived not only from research but also from the relationship with business domains. It is impossible to assume differentiating factors without taking commonality and identity between society and its history.\r\n\r\nConsidering many variable parts, structural unions, and *functional equivalents* in the deep learning paradigm, which are variants derived not only from research but also from the relationship with business domains, from perspective of *commonality/variability analysis* in order to practice object-oriented design, this library provides abstract classes that define the skeleton of the deep Learning algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps in concrete variant algorithms such as the **Deep Boltzmann Machines**, **Stacked Auto-Encoder**, **Encoder/Decoder based on LSTM**, and **Convolutional Auto-Encoder** to client subclasses. The abstract classes and the interfaces in this library let subclasses redefine certain steps of the deep Learning algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.\r\n\r\nThese abstract classes can also provide new original models and algorithms such as **Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)**, **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, or **Neural network language model** by implementing the variable parts of the fluid elements of objects.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Distinguishing between this library and other libraries.\r\n\r\nThe functions of Deep Learning are already available in many machine learning libraries. Broadly speaking, the deep learning functions provided by each machine learning library can be divided into the following two.\r\n\r\n1. A component that works just by running a batch program or API.\r\n2. A component that allows you to freely design its functions and algorithms.\r\n\r\nMany of the former have somewhat fixed error functions, initialization strategies, samplers, activation functions, regularization, and deep architecture configurations. That is, the functional extensibility is low. If you just want to run a distributed batch program or demo code, or just run it on a pre-designed interface, you should be fine with these components.\r\n\r\nBut, in-house R&D aimed at extending to more accurate and faster algorithms, it is a risk to rely on distributions that are less functionally reusable and less functionally scalable. In addition, many of the \"A component that works just by running a batch program or API\" tend to be specified with the condition that \"if you prepare an appropriate dataset, it will work\". The \"appropriateness\" of the \"appropriate dataset\" is often undecidable without knowing the inside of the black box obscured by its components.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the existing machine learning library, the latter \"A component that allows you to freely design its functions and algorithms\" is certainly distributed. For example, MxNet/Gluon's `HybridBlock` gives you the freedom to design functions. Similar things can be done with PyTorch's `torch.nn`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it cannot be said that a single algorithm can be produced in-house simply by making full use of these components. In-house R&D is also an organizational decision-making process. In this procedure, problems that can be solved by machine learning and statistics are first set in order to meet the demands from the business domain. Then, we will design an algorithm that functions as a problem-solving solution to this problem setting.\r\n\r\nHowever, it cannot be said that there is only one function as a problem solution. Unless we compare several functionally equivalent algorithms that help solve the problem, it remains unclear which algorithm should be the final choice.\r\n\r\n#### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.\r\n\r\nFrom perspective of *commonality/variability analysis* in order to practice object-oriented design, the concepts and interfaces of Deep Learning paradigms can be organized as follows:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/accel-brain-base_class_interface.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n- `ExtractableData` is an interface responsible for extracting data from local files.\r\n- `NoiseableData` is an interface that has the function of enhancing robustness by adding noise to the extracted sample.\r\n- `IteratableData` is an interface that has the function of repeatedly outputting labeled and unlabeled samples by calling a class that implements` ExtractableData`. This function is the heart of iterative learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent. Whether or not to put the data in GPU memory can be selected in this subclass.\r\n- `SamplableData` is a useful interface for introducing neural network learning algorithms into data sampling processing, especially for Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).\r\n- `ObservableData` is an interface for implementing neural network models in general. All of these subclasses are designed with the assumption that `IteratableData` will be delegated. You can also observe the mini-batch data extracted by `SamplableData`. Of course, the input / output function is variable depending on the problem setting, but basically it executes inference for the observed data points. The presence or absence of hyperparameters and GPUs can be adjusted in this subclass.\r\n- `ComputableLoss` is nothing but an interface for error/loss functions. Each subclass is premised on the automatic differentiation function implemented in the machine learning library.\r\n- `RegularizatableData` is the interface for performing regularization. The amount that the regular term is given as a penalty term can be realized inside the forward propagation method or inside the error/loss function. This interface works when other special regularizations are performed immediately after parameter updates.\r\n- `ControllableModel` functions as a controller when implementing complex `ObservableData` in combination as a complex system(or System of Systems) such as deep reinforcement learning and hostile generation network.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, each subclass that implements these interfaces is considered functionally equivalent and mutually substitutable. For example, the following classes are implemented as subclasses of `ObservableData`.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/accel-brain-base_class_observable_data.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nFor example, `Neural Networks` makes it possible to build multi-layer neural networks. And, after inheriting this class, `AutoEncoder` constructed by joining two` NeuralNetworks`s in a stack is placed. There is a similar relationship between `LSTMNetworks` for building LSTM(Long short-term memory) Networks, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks, and its subclass `EncoderDecoder`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, various subclasses are arranged for `ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks`, which builds convolutional neural networks. Many relatively new learning algorithms, such as **semi-supervised learning** and **self-supervised learning**, have been proposed as extensions of convolutional neural networks. Therefore, when these algorithms are implemented, they are often implemented as a subclass of `ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks`.\r\n\r\nWhen adopting a functionalism, such a series of interface designs assists in the search for functional equivalents. Since each class that realizes the same interface is designed on the premise of the same interface specifications, it is easy to consider it as a candidate for functional equivalent.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, developers using this library can reduce the burden of functional expansion as well as searching for functional equivalents. In fact, there are functional extensions to this library.\r\n\r\nFor example, [Automatic Summarization Library: pysummarization](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Automatic-Summarization), which realizes automatic document summarization by natural language processing and text mining, reuses the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model realized by [accel-brain-base](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Accel-Brain-Base). This sub-library makes it possilbe to do automatically document summarization and clustering based on the manifold hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in [Reinforcement Learning Library: pyqlearning](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning) and [Generative Adversarial Networks Library: pygan](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Generative-Adversarial-Networks), Reinforcement Learning and various variants of GANs are implemented.\r\n\r\n## Problem Re-Setting: What concept does this library design?\r\n\r\nLet's exemplify the basic deep architecture that this library has already designed. Users can functionally reuse or functionally extend the already implemented architecture.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Deep Boltzmann Machines.\r\n\r\nThe function of this library is building and modeling Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM) and Deep Boltzmann Machine(DBM). The models are functionally equivalent to stacked auto-encoder. The basic function is the same as dimensions reduction or pre-learning for so-called transfer learning.\r\n\r\n#### The structure of RBM.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table><tr><td><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/boltzmann_machine.png\" /></td><td><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/complete_bipartite_graph.png\" /></td></tr><tr><td>Boltzmann Machine</td><td>Restricted Boltzmann Machine</td></tr></table></div>\r\n\r\nAccording to graph theory, the structure of RBM corresponds to a complete bipartite graph which is a special kind of bipartite graph where every node in the visible layer is connected to every node in the hidden layer. Based on statistical mechanics and thermodynamics(Ackley, D. H., Hinton, G. E., & Sejnowski, T. J. 1985), the state of this structure can be reflected by the energy function:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/energy_function_of_rbm.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nwhere <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/b.png\" /> is a bias in visible layer, <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/c.png\" /> is a bias in hidden layer, <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/v.png\" /> is an activity or a state in visible layer, <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/h.png\" /> is an activity or a state in hidden layer, and <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/w.png\" /> is a weight matrix in visible and hidden layer. The activities can be calculated as the below product, since the link of activations of visible layer and hidden layer are conditionally independent.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/conditionally_independent.png\" /></div>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/define_lambda.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n#### The learning equations of RBM.\r\n\r\nBecause of the rules of conditional independence, the learning equations of RBM can be introduced as simple form. The distribution of visible state <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/v.png\" /> which is marginalized over the hidden state <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/h.png\" /> is as following:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/distribution_of_visible_state.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nwhere <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/partition_function.png\" /> is a partition function in statistical mechanics or thermodynamics. Let <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/D.png\" /> be set of observed data points, then <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/D_defined.png\" />. Therefore the gradients on the parameter <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/theta.png\" /> of the log-likelihood function are\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/gradients_v_on_the_parameter_theta.png\" /></div>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/gradients_h_on_the_parameter_theta.png\" /></div>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/gradients_w_on_the_parameter_theta.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nwhere <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/expected_value.png\" /> is an expected value for <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/p_x_theta.png\" />. <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/sig.png\" /> is a sigmoid function.\r\n\r\nThe learning equations of RBM are introduced by performing control so that those gradients can become zero.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/learning_equation_of_RBM.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n#### Contrastive Divergence as an approximation method.\r\n\r\n<div algin=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_RBM.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nIn relation to RBM, **Contrastive Divergence**(CD) is a method for approximation of the gradients of the log-likelihood(Hinton, G. E. 2002). The procedure of this method is similar to Markov Chain Monte Carlo method(MCMC). However, unlike MCMC, the visbile variables to be set first in visible layer is not randomly initialized but the observed data points in training dataset are set to the first visbile variables. And, like Gibbs sampler, drawing samples from hidden variables and visible variables is repeated `k` times. Empirically (and surprisingly), `k` is considered to be `1`.\r\n\r\n#### The structure of DBM.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"> \r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_DBN_and_DBM.png\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAs is well known, DBM is composed of layers of RBMs stacked on top of each other(Salakhutdinov, R., & Hinton, G. E. 2009). This model is a structural expansion of Deep Belief Networks(DBN), which is known as one of the earliest models of Deep Learning(Le Roux, N., & Bengio, Y. 2008). Like RBM, DBN places nodes in layers. However, only the uppermost layer is composed of undirected edges, and the other consists of directed edges. DBN with `R` hidden layers is below probabilistic model:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbn_model.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nwhere `r = 0` points to visible layer. Considerling simultaneous distribution in top two layer, \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbn_top_two_layer_joint.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nand conditional distributions in other layers are as follows:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbn_other_layers.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nThe pre-learning of DBN engages in a procedure of recursive learning in layer-by-layer. However, as you can see from the difference of graph structure, DBM is slightly different from DBN in the form of pre-learning. For instance, if `r = 1`, the conditional distribution of visible layer is \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/conditional_distribution_of_visible_layer.png\" />.</div>\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the conditional distribution in the intermediate layer is\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbm_other_hidden_layer.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nwhere `2` has been introduced considering that the intermediate layer `r` receives input data from Shallower layer\r\n`r-1` and deeper layer `r+1`. DBM sets these parameters as initial states.\r\n\r\n#### DBM as a Stacked Auto-Encoder.\r\n\r\nDBM is functionally equivalent to a **Stacked Auto-Encoder**, which is-a neural network that tries to reconstruct its input. To *encode* the observed data points, the function of DBM is as linear transformation of feature map below\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbm_encoder.png\" />.</div>\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to *decode* this feature points, the function of DBM is as linear transformation of feature map below\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/latex/dbm_decoder.png\" />.</div>\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction error should be calculated in relation to problem setting such as the Representation Learning. In default, this library computes Mean Squared Error(MSE) or L2 norm. For instance, my jupyter notebook: [demo/Deep-Boltzmann-Machines-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Deep-Boltzmann-Machines-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb) demonstrates that DBM which is a Stacked Auto-Encoder can minimize the reconstruction errors based on the Representation Learning.\r\n\r\n### Functionally equivalent: Encoder/Decoder based on LSTM.\r\n\r\nThe methodology of *equivalent-functionalism* enables us to introduce more functional equivalents and compare problem solutions structured with different algorithms and models in common problem setting. For example, in dimension reduction problem, the function of **Encoder/Decoder schema** is equivalent to **DBM** as a **Stacked Auto-Encoder**.\r\n\r\nAccording to the neural networks theory, and in relation to manifold hypothesis, it is well known that multilayer neural networks can learn features of observed data points and have the feature points in hidden layer. High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training the model such as **Stacked Auto-Encoder** and **Encoder/Decoder** with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. This function of dimensionality reduction facilitates feature expressions to calculate similarity of each data point.\r\n\r\nThis library provides **Encoder/Decoder based on LSTM**, which is a reconstruction model and makes it possible to extract series features embedded in deeper layers. The LSTM encoder learns a fixed length vector of time-series observed data points and the LSTM decoder uses this representation to reconstruct the time-series using the current hidden state and the value inferenced at the previous time-step.\r\n\r\n#### Encoder/Decoder for Anomaly Detection(EncDec-AD)\r\n\r\nOne interesting application example is the **Encoder/Decoder for Anomaly Detection (EncDec-AD)** paradigm (Malhotra, P., et al. 2016). This reconstruction model learns to reconstruct *normal* time-series behavior, and thereafter uses reconstruction error to detect anomalies. Malhotra, P., et al. (2016) showed that EncDec-AD paradigm is robust and can detect anomalies from predictable, unpredictable, periodic, aperiodic, and quasi-periodic time-series. Further, they showed that the paradigm is able to detect anomalies from short time-series (length as small as 30) as well as long time-series (length as large as 500).\r\n\r\nAs the prototype is exemplified in [demo/Encoder-Decoder-based-on-LSTM-for-Anomaly-Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Encoder-Decoder-based-on-LSTM-for-Anomaly-Detection.ipynb), this library provides Encoder/Decoder based on LSTM as a EncDec-AD scheme.\r\n\r\n### Functionally equivalent: Convolutional Auto-Encoder.\r\n\r\n**Convolutional Auto-Encoder**(Masci, J., et al., 2011) is a functionally equivalent of **Stacked Auto-Encoder** in relation to problem settings such as image segmentation, object detection, inpainting and graphics. A stack of Convolutional Auto-Encoder forms a convolutional neural network(CNN), which are among the most successful models for supervised image classification. Each Convolutional Auto-Encoder is trained using conventional on-line gradient descent without additional regularization terms.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/horse099.jpg\" />\r\n<p>Image in <a href=\"https://avaminzhang.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/%E3%80%90dataset%E3%80%91weizmann-horses/\" target=\"_blank\">the Weizmann horse dataset</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern/img/reconstructed_by_CAE.gif\" />\r\n<p>Reconstructed image by <strong>Convolutional Auto-Encoder</strong>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThis library can draw a distinction between **Stacked Auto-Encoder** and **Convolutional Auto-Encoder**, and is able to design and implement respective models. **Stacked Auto-Encoder** ignores the 2 dimentional image structures. In many cases, the rank of observed tensors extracted from image dataset is more than 3. This is not only a problem when dealing with realistically sized inputs, but also introduces redundancy in the parameters, forcing each feature to be global. Like **Shape-BM**, **Convolutional Auto-Encoder** differs from **Stacked Auto-Encoder** as their weights are shared among all locations in the input, preserving spatial locality. Hence, the reconstructed image data is due to a linear combination of basic image patches based on the latent code.\r\n\r\nIn this library, **Convolutional Auto-Encoder** is also based on **Encoder/Decoder** scheme. The *encoder* is to the *decoder* what the *Convolution* is to the *Deconvolution*. The Deconvolution also called transposed convolutions \"work by swapping the forward and backward passes of a convolution.\" (Dumoulin, V., & Visin, F. 2016, p20.)\r\n\r\nIn relation to the Representation Learning, like DBM, this model also can minimize the reconstruction errors. An example can be found in  [demo/Convolutional-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Convolutional-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb).\r\n\r\n### Functionally equivalent: Convolutional Contractive Auto-Encoder.\r\n\r\nThis library also provides some functionally equivalents of the Convolutional Auto-Encoder. For instance, **Convolutional Contractive Auto-Encoder(Contractive CAE)** is a Convolutional Auto-Encoder based on the First-Order Contractive Auto-Encoder(Rifai, S., et al., 2011), which executes the representation learning by adding a penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input and results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer.\r\n\r\nAnalogically, the Contractive Convolutional Auto-Encoder calculates the penalty term. But it differs in that the operation of the deconvolution intervenes insted of inner product. The prototype is exemplified in [demo/Contractive-Convolutional-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Contractive-Convolutional-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb).\r\n\r\n## Issue: Structural extension from Auto-Encoders and Encoder/Decoders to energy-based models and Generative models.\r\n\r\nAuto-Encoders, such as the Encoder/Decoder, the Convolutional Auto-Encoder, and the DBM have in common that these models are Stacked Auto-Encoders or the reconstruction models. On the other hand, the Auto-Encoders and the Encoder/Decoders are not statistical mechanical energy-based models unlike with RBM or DBM.\r\n\r\nHowever, Auto-Encoders have traditionally been used to represent energy-based models. According to the statistical mechanical theory for **energy-based models**, Auto-Encoders constructed by neural networks can be associated with an energy landscape, akin to negative log-probability in a probabilistic model, which measures how well the Auto-Encoder can represent regions in the input space. The energy landscape has been commonly inferred heuristically, by using a training criterion that relates the Auto-Encoder to a probabilistic model such as a RBM. The energy function is identical to the free energy of the corresponding RBM, showing that Auto-Encoders and RBMs may be viewed as two different ways to derive training criteria for forming the same type of analytically defined energy landscape.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Auto-Encoder as a dynamical system allows us to understand how an energy function may be derived for the Auto-Encoder. This makes it possible to assign energies to Auto-Encoders with many different types of activation functions and outputs, and consider minimanization of reconstruction errors as energy minimanization(Kamyshanska, H., & Memisevic, R., 2014).\r\n\r\nWhen trained with some regularization terms, the Auto-Encoders have the ability to learn an energy manifold without supervision or negative examples(Zhao, J., et al., 2016). This means that even when an energy-based Auto-Encoding model is trained to reconstruct a real sample, the model contributes to discovering the data manifold by itself.\r\n\r\nThis library provides energy-based Auto-Encoders such as **Contractive Convolutional Auto-Encoder**(Rifai, S., et al., 2011), **Repelling Convolutional Auto-Encoder**(Zhao, J., et al., 2016), **Denoising Auto-Encoders**(Bengio, Y., et al., 2013), and **Ladder Networks**(Valpola, H., 2015). But it is more usefull to redescribe the Auto-Encoders in the framework of **Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)**(Goodfellow, I., et al., 2014) to make those models function as not only energy-based models but also Generative models. For instance, theory of an **Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs)**(Makhzani, A., et al., 2015) and **energy-based GANs(EBGANs)**(Zhao, J., et al., 2016) enables us to turn Auto-Encoders into a Generative models which referes energy functions.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).\r\n\r\nThe Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) framework establishes a\r\nmin-max adversarial game between two neural networks – a generative model, `G`, and a discriminative\r\nmodel, `D`. The discriminator model, `D(x)`, is a neural network that computes the probability that\r\na observed data point `x` in data space is a sample from the data distribution (positive samples) that we are trying to model, rather than a sample from our generative model (negative samples). Concurrently, the generator uses a function `G(z)` that maps samples `z` from the prior `p(z)` to the data space. `G(z)` is trained to maximally confuse the discriminator into believing that samples it generates come from the data distribution. The generator is trained by leveraging the gradient of `D(x)` w.r.t. `x`, and using that to modify its parameters.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: *Conditional* GANs (or cGANs).\r\n\r\nThe *Conditional* GANs (or cGANs) is a simple extension of the basic GAN model which allows the model to condition on external information. This makes it possible to engage the learned generative model in different \"modes\" by providing it with different contextual information (Gauthier, J. 2014).\r\n\r\nThis model can be constructed by simply feeding the data, `y`, to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. In an unconditioned generative model, because the maps samples `z` from the prior `p(z)` are drawn from uniform or normal distribution, there is no control on modes of the data being generated. On the other hand, it is possible to direct the data generation process by conditioning the model on additional information (Mirza, M., & Osindero, S. 2014).\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs).\r\n\r\nThis library also provides the Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs), which is a probabilistic Auto-Encoder that uses GANs to perform variational inference by matching the aggregated posterior of the feature points in hidden layer of the Auto-Encoder with an arbitrary prior distribution(Makhzani, A., et al., 2015). Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the Adversarial Auto-Encoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_adversarial-autoencoder.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network(EBGAN).\r\n\r\nReusing the Auto-Encoders, this library introduces the Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (EBGAN) model(Zhao, J., et al., 2016) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. THe Auto-Encoders have traditionally been used to represent energy-based models. When trained with some regularization terms, the Auto-Encoders have the ability to learn an energy manifold without supervision or negative examples. This means that even when an energy-based Auto-Encoding model is trained to reconstruct a real sample, the model contributes to discovering the data manifold by itself.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_EBGAN.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n### Functionally equivalent: Energy-based Adversarial Auto-Encoders(EBAAEs).\r\n\r\nThis library models the **Energy-based Adversarial-Auto-Encoder(EBAAE)** by structural coupling between AAEs and EBGAN. As the prototype is exemplified in [demo/Energy-based-Adversarial-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Energy-based-Adversarial-Auto-Encoder-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb), the learning algorithm equivalents an adversarial training of AAEs as a generator and EBGAN as a discriminator.\r\n\r\n## Issue: How unsupervised learning like Auto-Encoder, Energy-based Model, and Generative Model can function in classification problem?\r\n\r\nIn most classification problems, finding and producing labels for the samples is hard. In many cases plenty of unlabeled data existand it seems obvious that using them should improve the results. For instance, there are plenty of unlabeled images available and in most image classification tasks there are vastly more bits of information in the statistical structure of input images than in their labels.\r\n\r\nIt is argued here that the reason why unsupervised learning has not been able to improve results is that most current versions are incompatible with supervised learning. The problem is that many un-supervised learning methods try to represent as much information about the original data as possible whereas supervised learning tries to filter out all the information which is irrelevant for the task at hand.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Ladder Networks.\r\n\r\nLadder network is an Auto-Encoder which can discard information Unsupervised learning needs to toleratediscarding information in order to work well with supervised learning. Many unsupervised learning methods are not good at this but one class of models stands out as an exception: hierarchical latent variable models. Unfortunately their derivation can be quite complicated and often involves approximations which compromise their per-formance.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table><tr><td><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_HierarchicalLatentVariableModels.png\" /></td><td><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_Auto-Encoder.png\" /></td><td><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_LadderNetworks.png\" /></td></tr><tr><td>Hierarchical Latent Variable Models</td><td>Auto-Encoder</td><td>Ladder Networks</td></tr></table></div>\r\n\r\nA simpler alternative is offered by Auto-Encoders which also have the benefit of being compatible with standard supervised feedforward networks. They would be a promising candidate for combining supervised and unsupervised learning but unfortunately Auto-Encoders normally correspond to latent variable models with a single layer of stochastic variables, that is, they do not tolerate discarding information.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_cost_function_LadderNetworks.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nLadder network makes it possible to solve that problem by settting recursive derivation of the learning rule with a distributed cost function, building denoisng Auto-Encoder recursively. Normally denoising Auto-Encoders have a fixed input but the cost functions on the higher layers can influence their input mappings and this creates a bias towards PCA-type solutions.\r\n\r\nIn relation to problem settings such as the Representation Learning, the Ladder Networks is also functionally equivalent of standard CAE as the prototype is exemplified in [demo/Convolutional-Ladder-Networks-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Convolutional-Ladder-Networks-for-Representation-Learning.ipynb).\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Deep Reconstruction-Classification Networks(DRCN or DRCNetworks).\r\n\r\n**Deep Reconstruction-Classification Network(DRCN or DRCNetworks)** is a convolutional network that jointly learns two tasks: \r\n\r\n1. supervised source label prediction.\r\n2. unsupervised target data reconstruction. \r\n\r\nIdeally, a discriminative representation should model both the label and the structure of the data. Based on that intuition, Ghifary, M., et al.(2016) hypothesize that a domain-adaptive representation should satisfy two criteria:\r\n\r\n1. classify well the source domain labeled data.\r\n2. reconstruct well the target domain unlabeled data, which can be viewed as an approximate of the ideal discriminative representation.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_DRCN.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nThe encoding parameters of the DRCN are shared across both tasks, while the decoding parameters are sepa-rated. The aim is that the learned label prediction function can perform well onclassifying images in the target domain thus the data reconstruction can beviewed as an auxiliary task to support the adaptation of the label prediction.\r\n\r\nUsing this library, for instance, we can extend the Convolutional Auto-Encoder in DRCNetworks to the Convolutional Ladder Networks as mentioned in [demo/DRCNetworks-for-Dataset-Bias-Problem.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/DRCNetworks-for-Dataset-Bias-Problem.ipynb).\r\n\r\n### Functional equivalent: Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation.\r\n\r\nXu, J., Xiao, L., & López, A. M. (2019) proposed **Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation** framework. This model learns a domain invariant feature representation by incorporating a pretext learning task which can automatically create labels from target domain images. The pretext and main task such as classification problem, object detection problem, or semantic segmentation problem are learned jointly via multi-task learning.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/accel-brain-base/network_of_Self-Supervised_domain_adaptation.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\nWhile DRCNetworks jointly learns supervised source label prediction and unsupervised target data reconstruction, Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation learns supervised label prediction in source domain and unsupervised pretext-task in target domain. DRCNetworks and Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation are alike in not only network structures but also learning algorithms. Neither is mere supervised learning, nor is it mere unsupervised learning. The learning algorithm of DRCNetworks is a semi-supervised learning, but Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation literally does self-supervised learning.\r\n\r\nUsing this library, for instance, we can extend the Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation as mentioned in [demo/Self-Supervised-Domain-Adaptation-for-Classfication-Problem.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Self-Supervised-Domain-Adaptation-for-Classfication-Problem.ipynb\r\n) and [demo/Self-Supervised-Domain-Adaptation-with-Adversarial-training-for-Classfication-Problem.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/Self-Supervised-Domain-Adaptation-with-Adversarial-training-for-Classfication-Problem.ipynb).\r\n\r\n## Issue: Structural extension for Deep Reinforcement Learning.\r\n\r\nThe **Reinforcement learning** theory presents several issues from a perspective of deep learning theory(Mnih, V., et al. 2013). Firstly, deep learning applications have required large amounts of hand-labelled training data. Reinforcement learning algorithms, on the other hand, must be able to learn from a scalar reward signal that is frequently sparse, noisy and delayed.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two theories is not only the type of data but also the timing to be observed. The delay between taking actions and receiving rewards, which can be thousands of timesteps long, seems particularly daunting when compared to the direct association between inputs and targets found in supervised learning.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that deep learning algorithms assume the data samples to be independent, while in reinforcement learning one typically encounters sequences of highly correlated states. Furthermore, in Reinforcement learning, the data distribution changes as the algorithm learns new behaviours, presenting aspects of recursive learning, which can be problematic for deep learning methods that assume a fixed underlying distribution.\r\n\r\n## Problem Re-setting: Generalisation, or a function approximation.\r\n\r\nThis library considers problem setteing in which an agent interacts with an environment <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/mathcal_E.png\" />, in a sequence of actions, observations and rewards. At each time-step the agent selects an action at from the set of possible actions, <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/A_1_K.png\" />. The state/action-value function is <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_s_a.png\" />.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the agent is to interact with the <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/mathcal_E.png\" /> by selecting actions in a way that maximises future rewards. We can make the standard assumption that future rewards are discounted by a factor of $\\gamma$ per time-step, and define the future discounted return at time <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/t.png\" /> as \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/r_t_sum_t_t_T_gamma.png\" />, \r\n\r\nwhere <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Tt.png\" /> is the time-step at which the agent will reach the goal. This library defines the optimal state/action-value function <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_ast_s_a.png\" /> as the maximum expected return achievable by following any strategy, after seeing some state <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/s.png\" /> and then taking some action <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/a.png\" />, \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_ast_s_a_max_pi_E.png\" />, \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nwhere <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/pi.png\" /> is a policy mapping sequences to actions (or distributions over actions). \r\n\r\nThe optimal state/action-value function obeys an important identity known as the Bellman equation. This is based on the following *intuition*: if the optimal value <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_ast_s_d_a_d.png\" /> of the sequence <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/s_d.png\" /> at the next time-step was known for all possible actions <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/a_d.png\" />, then the optimal strategy is to select the action <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/a_d.png\" /> maximising the expected value of \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/r_gamma_Q_ast_s_d_a_d.png\" />, \r\n</div>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_ast_s_d_a_d_mathbb_E_s_d_sim_mathcal_E.png\" />.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind many reinforcement learning algorithms is to estimate the state/action-value function, by using the Bellman equation as an iterative update,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_i_1_s_a_mathbb_E_r_gamma_max_a_d.png\" />.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nSuch *value iteration algorithms* converge to the optimal state/action-value function, <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_i_rightarrow_Q_ast.png\" /> as <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/i_rightarrow_infty.png\" />. \r\n\r\nBut increasing the complexity of states/actions is equivalent to increasing the number of combinations of states/actions. If the value function is continuous and granularities of states/actions are extremely fine, the combinatorial explosion will be encountered. In other words, this basic approach is totally impractical, because the state/action-value function is estimated separately for each sequence, without any **generalisation**. Instead, it is common to use a **function approximator** to estimate the state/action-value function,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/Q_s_a_theta_approx_Q_ast_s_a.png\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nSo the Reduction of complexities is required.\r\n\r\n### Problem Solution: Deep Q-Network\r\n\r\nIn this problem setting, the function of nerual network or deep learning is a function approximation with weights <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/theta.png\" /> as a Q-Network. A Q-Network can be trained by minimising a loss functions <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/L_i_theta_i.png\" /> that changes at each iteration <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/i.png\" />,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/L_i_theta_i_mathbb_E_s_a_sim_rho_cdot.png\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nwhere \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/y_i_mathbb_E_s_d_sim_mathcal_E_r_gamma_max_a_d.png\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nis the target for iteration <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/i.png\" /> and <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/rho_cdot.png\" /> is a so-called behaviour distribution. This is probability distribution over states and actions. The parameters from the previous iteration <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/theta_i_1.png\" /> are held fixed when optimising the loss function <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/L_i_theta_i.png\" />. Differentiating the loss function with respect to the weights we arrive at the following gradient,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Reinforcement-Learning/img/latex/nabla_theta_i_L_i_theta_i_mathbb_E_s_a_sim_rho_cdot.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n### Functional equivalent: MobileNet.\r\n\r\nIf you pay attention to the calculation speed, it is better to extend the CNN part that is the function approximation to MobileNet. As mentioned in [demo/MobileNet-v2-for-Image-Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Accel-Brain-Base/demo/MobileNet-v2-for-Image-Classification.ipynb), this library provides the MobileNet V2(Sandler, M., et al., 2018).\r\n\r\n### Functional equivalent: LSTM.\r\n\r\nIt is not inevitable to functionally reuse CNN as a function approximator. In the above problem setting of generalisation and Combination explosion, for instance, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks, which is-a special Reccurent Neural Network(RNN) structure, and CNN as a function approximator are functionally equivalent. In the same problem setting, functional equivalents can be functionally replaced. Considering that the feature space of the rewards has the time-series nature, LSTM will be more useful.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nThe basic concepts, theories, and methods behind this library are described in the following books.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08PV4ZQG5/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Accel-Brain-Books/In-house_R_and_D_in_the_era_of_democratization_of_AI/book_cover.jpg\" width=\"160px\" /></a>\r\n  <p>『<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08PV4ZQG5/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1607343553&s=digital-text&sr=1-1&text=%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BEAccel+Brain\" target=\"_blank\">「AIの民主化」時代の企業内研究開発: 深層学習の「実学」としての機能分析</a>』(Japanese)</p></div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n  \r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B093Z533LK\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Accel-Brain-Books/AI_vs_Investors_as_Noise_Traders/book_cover.jpg\" width=\"160px\" /></a>\r\n  <p>『<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B093Z533LK\" target=\"_blank\">AI vs. ノイズトレーダーとしての投資家たち: 「アルゴリズム戦争」時代の証券投資戦略</a>』(Japanese)</p></div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0994CH3CM\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Accel-Brain-Books/Babel_of_Natural_Language_Processing/book_cover.jpg\" width=\"160px\" /></a>\r\n  <p>『<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0994CH3CM\" target=\"_blank\">自然言語処理のバベル: 文書自動要約、文章生成AI、チャットボットの意味論</a>』(Japanese)</p></div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09C4KYZBX\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/accel-brain-code/Accel-Brain-Books/Origin_of_the_statistical_machine_learning/book_cover.jpg\" width=\"160px\" /></a>\r\n  <p>『<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09C4KYZBX\" target=\"_blank\">統計的機械学習の根源: 熱力学、量子力学、統計力学における天才物理学者たちの神学的な理念</a>』(Japanese)</p></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific references are the following papers and books.\r\n\r\n### Deep Boltzmann machines.\r\n\r\n- Ackley, D.
