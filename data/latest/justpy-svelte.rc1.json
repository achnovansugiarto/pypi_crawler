    "description": "# [JustPy-Svelte](https://github.com/Monallabs-org/justpy-svelte)\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nJustpy-svelte is a trimmed down version of [justpy](https://justpy.io/) that replaces Vue engine with \nSvelte for the frontend. Many frontend utitiles that were build on \nVue engine in Justpy are not supported here. Specifically, these ones:\n- AGGRID \n- AGGRID_ENTERPRISE \n- BOKEH \n- DECKGL \n- HIGHCHARTS \n- KATEX \n- PLOTLY \n- QUASAR \n- QUASAR_VERSION \n- VEGA \n\n\nThe surface level programming in justpy-svelte remains practically the same as Justpy. \nSo all the tutorials and demos of Justpy are applicable to Justpy-Svelte. \nHowever, some of the core functionalities of Justpy currently are not available (see list\nof examples/tutorials/tests currently passing and failing with justpy-svelte). \n\nJustpy-svelte is primarly designed to be driven via [ofjustpy](https://github.com/Monallabs-org/ofjustpy) - a functional programming approach to webapp development in Python. However,\nit is fully functional and usable as standalone substitute for justpy. \n\n## Why Svelte \nCode readability, especially for non-javascript programmers, was the primary reason for porting Justpy over to Svelte. Vue on its own is powerful, has be around for longer, and has large ecosystem of libraries/tools build around it. However, I felt it was not an easy framework to pick up and comprehend, especially for non-javascript programmers. \n\nComparatively, programming in  Svelte is much more straightforward and easy to comprehend \nfor programmers coming from C/C++/Python/Java background. \n\nIts yet to be seen if Svelte offers any other advantages over Vue. \nThere is good reason to hope for that. Svelte is a newer runtime and has \nvery different architecture and execution paradigm, which could yield some \nadvantages like being more responsive, executing faster, and better\ncoordination between Python runtime backend with the Javascript/Svelte frontend. \n\n## Notes\n-  static directory by default is the directory from where the webserver is invoked\n\n\n## Usage\nThe programming with justpy-svelte is same as [justpy](https://justpy.io/) with few difference\nwith respect to how starlette app  is instantiated and how routing is done.\n\n```python\napp = jp.build_app()\n```\nThe `build_app` function takes `middlewares` and `startup_func`\nas arguments using which you can pass the list of all \n[middlewares](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/)\nfor the app and the [startup function](https://www.starlette.io/applications/) \nto be executed at the start of the app\n\nIn order to attach a url path to a specific endpoint, i.e., perform routing\nusing \np\n``` python\napp.add_jproute(\"/user/home\", wp_func)\n```\n\nRest of the usage remains the same -- checkout the examples\nlisted below to get a concrete sense of programming \nwith justpy-svelte:\n\n\n###
