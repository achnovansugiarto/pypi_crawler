    "description": "# Documentation for AMR Context Extraction\nThis document provides an overview of how the proposed tool can be installed and used. It attempts to document all necessary details to set up the tool, and provides some run guides.\n\n## Overview\nThis tool can be used to extract the neighborhood of the target Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes from the assembly graph.\nIt can also be used to simulate sequence reads from some reference genomes (through ART), run MetaSPAdes to assemble the simulated reads and then reconstruct the neighborhood of the AMR genes.\n\n## Installation\n### Step I: install the dependencies\nOur tool relies on several dependencies, including Python, Prokka, RGI, BLAST, Bandage, MetaSPAdes (in case the assembly graph has not already been generated) and ART (in case of simulating reads).\nThe most straight forward way to install this tool's dependencies is using bioconda.\n#### Cloning the tool repository\n`git clone https://github.com/beiko-lab/AMR_context`\n\nNow, move to AMR_context directory.\n#### Installing bioconda\nMake sure [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html) has been installed and the channels are set properly as follows.\n```\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\n#### Creating a new conda environment\nIt's recommend to set up a conda environment first, so packages and\nversions don't get mixed up with system versions.\n`conda create -n amr_context python=3.6.10`\n\n#### Activating the conda environment\n`conda activate amr_context`\n\n#### Installing BLAST\nThe installation instructions are available for [Linux/Unix/MacOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/) and [Windows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52637/). For more details, please refer to [Blast+ user manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/).\n\n#### Installing dependencies through conda\n```\nconda install pip\nconda install rgi=5.1.1\nconda install prokka\nconda install art\nconda install bandage\n```\nLinks to their repositories can be found here:\n- prokka: https://github.com/tseemann/prokka\n- RGI: https://github.com/arpcard/rgi\n- Bandage: https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/\n- ART: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/\n\nNote: In case, prokka can't be installed through bioconda, I suggest using the docker\ncontainer [staphb/prokka](https://hub.docker.com/r/staphb/prokka) by the following command:\n`docker pull staphb/prokka:latest`. Please note that PROKKA_COMMAND_PREFIX variable in params.py need to be updated with an appropriate value which is probably an empty string unless prokka is run through docker.  \n\n#### Installing python requirements\nNote: Make sure that you are in the root directory of this tool (AMR_context).\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\n### Step II: Testing\n#### Updating params.py\nMake sure to update the following parameter in code/params.py.\n- PROKKA_COMMAND_PREFIX (it probably should either be an empty string or the command from docker if you installed prokka via docker)\n\nNote: you might also need to update the following parameters in code/params.py to provide the path to Bandage, ART and SPAdes, in case they have not been installed via conda.\n- BANDAGE_PATH (the path to access bandage executable file)\n- ART_PATH (the path to access art_illumina directory)\n- SPADES_PATH (the path to spades.py)\n\n\n#### Running the test code\nTo run the code, make sure you are in the created conda environment.\nTo activate it, run:\n\n`conda activate amr_context`\n\nand then run the code by:\n\n`python code/full_pipeline.py`\n\nNote: You don't need to install and set the parameters for ART and SPAdes if the assembly graph is provided as an input.\n\n#### Expected results\nAll results will be available in test directory.\nHere is the list of important directories and files that can be seen there and a short description of their content.\n- metagenome.fasta: a file containing all ref genomes.\n- metagenome_1.fq and metagenome_2.fq: reads simulated by ART from metagenome.fasta\n- AMR_info: if reference genomes are available, this directory contains the list of identified AMR sequences, their extracted neighborhood and annotation.\n  - AMR_info/sequences/:The sequence of identified AMRs is stored here, with a name similar to their original name (file name is generated by calling `code/utils.py::restricted_amr_name_from_modified_name(amr_name_from_title(amr_original_name)))`\n  - AMR_info/ref_annotations/: the annoation details are stored here.\n  - AMR_info/AMR_ref_neighborhood.fasta: all extracted neighborhood sequences are stored in this file.\n  - AMR_info/ref_neighborhood_annotations.csv: the summary of annotation info is stored in this csv file.\n- spade_output: This directory contains metaSPAdes assembly outputs.
