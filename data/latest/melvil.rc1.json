The solution is a sidecar metadata file and a file\nstructure organized as a spatial quadtree that is interacted with via a simple\nand lightweight NoSQL engine that is aware of these components.\n\nData is grouped in directories matching quadtree nodes in files that are grouped\ntime and primary key.  Managing the actual files is up to the user.  This library\nonly knows how to interact with the sidecar files.\n\nWe want to have both an API:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import melvil\n    import datetime\n\n    # The base directory, match expression, etc. are all defined in a configfile\n\n    # Only process data from the past 30 days that appears in the lower left\n    # quadrant of the world, as specified by WGS84\n    max_ts = datetime.datetime.now()q\n    min_ts = max_ts - datetime.timedelta(days=30)\n    bbox = (-180, -90 0, 0)\n\n    for fp in melvil.search(min_ts=min_ts, max_ts=max_ts, bbox=bbox):\n        with open(fp) as f:\n            # Do something\n\nAnd a CLI:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ melvil search --min-ts 2014-01-01 --max-ts 2015-01-01 --bbox -180 -90 0 0\n    /path/to/output/file/1\n    /path/to/output/file/2\n    /path/to/output/file/3\n    ...\n\nUnder the hood ``melvil`` is looking for\n\n\nDeveloping\n==========\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/SkyTruth/Dewey\n    $ cd Dewey\n    $ virtualenv venv\n    $ pip install -e .[test]\n    $ py.test tests --cov melvil --term-missing melvil\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nSee ``LICENSE.txt``.",
