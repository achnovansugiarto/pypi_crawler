    "description": "south-jurisdiction\n==================\n\nMotivation\n----------\nSouth isn't great at handling differing requirements from multiple databases\nin a django application.\n\nSouth assumes that there will at least be a south_migration_history table\navailable at the point of running migrate against a given database.\n\nThis is fine when your django app is only dealing with one default database,\nbut becomes much less pleasant when wanting to add extra database sources that\nperhaps south shouldn't have jurisdiction over.\n\n\nLet's say your ``django.conf`` settings look something like::\n\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            ...\n            'NAME': 'my_own_db',\n            ...\n        },\n\n        'super_secure': {\n            ...\n            'NAME': 'super_secure',\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n\nYou wouldn't want ``syncdb`` to create tables in the ``super_secure`` DB, and\nthat would be achieved by creating a database router, along with an\n``allow_syncdb`` method and include that in a ``DATABASE_ROUTER`` setting.\nDone.\n\nYou **also** wouldn't want ``migrate`` to do anything in super_secure. As it\nstands, ``south`` fails at this because the first thing it does is see if there\nare any migrations in the database by looking at the south_migration_history\ntable. Because syncdb didn't create this you get FAILURE.\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nSouth jurisdiction introduces a new setting to the django settings module::\n\n    SOUTH_MANAGED_DBS = []\n\nThis is intended to be populated with the keys of the databases that you want\nsouth to manage. In the above example it would read::\n\n    SOUTH_MANAGED_DBS = ['default']\n\nAny attempt to migrate on a database not included in SOUTH_MANAGED_DBS is\nrejected gracefully.\n\nIf this setting is not included in your django settings module then all\ndatabases will be looked at for migration as normal.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n - Add ``\"south_jurisdiction\"`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your settings, after\n   the ``\"south\"`` app.\n - Use the new ``SOUTH_MANAGED_DBS`` setting available to you.\n - If you don't want to run the south_jurisdiction tests, use the\n   ``SKIP_SOUTH_TESTS`` setting in the same way as you do for south.",
