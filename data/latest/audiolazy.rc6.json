However, the\neager evaluation done by most of these tools make it difficult, perhaps\nimpossible, to use them for real time audio processing. To avoid such\neagerness, one can make the calculations only when data is requested, not\nwhen the path to the data is given. This is the core idea in laziness that\nallows:\n\n- Real-time application (you don't need to wait until all data is\n  processed to have a result);\n- Endless data sequence representation;\n- Data-flow representation;\n- Task elimination when a reverse task is done: instead of doing something\n  to then undo, nothing needs to be done, and no conscious optimization\n  need to be done for that.\n\nAnother difficulty concerns expressive code creation for audio processing in\nblocks through indexes and vectors. Sometimes, that's unavoidable, or at\nleast such avoidance would limit the power of the system that works with\nsequence data.\n\nBlock sequences can be found from sample sequences being both objects, where\nthe latter can be the result of a method or function over the former. The\ninformation needed for such is the block size and where would start the next\nblock. Although one can think about the last block and the exact index where\nit would start, most of the time spent in steps like this one happens to be\nan implementation issue that just keep the focus away from the problem being\nworked on. To allow a thing like an endless data sequence, there should be\nno need to know when something stops.\n\nProbably an engineer would find the use of equations and structures from\nelectrical engineering theory much cleaner to understand than storing\neverything into data arrays, mainly when common operations are done to these\nrepresentations. What is the product of the filter with numerator\n``[1, 7, 2]`` and denominator ``[1, 0.5, 0.2]`` as its system equation with\nthe one that has the arrays reversed like ``[2, 7, 1]``? That might be simple,\nand the reversed would avoid questions like \"what comes first, the zero or the\n[minus] two exponent?\", but maybe we could get more efficient ourselves if we\nhad something easier: multiplication could be written once and for all and\nwith a representation programmers are used to see. This would be even more\nexpressive if we could get rid from the asymmetry of a method call like\n``filt1.multiply_by(filt2)``, since multiplication in this case should be\ncommutative. The use of natural operators is possible in a language that\nallows operator overloading, but for such we need to describe\nthose equations and structures as objects and object relationships.\n\nThe name ``Hz`` can be a number that would allow conversion to a default DSP\ninternal rad/samples unit, so one can write things like ``freq = 440 * Hz``.\nThis isn't difficult in probably any language, but can help in expressiveness,\nalready. If (almost) everything would need data in \"samples\" or \"rad/sample\"\nunits, constants for converting these from \"second\" and \"hertz\" would help\nwith the code expressiveness. A comb filter ``comb.tau(delay=30*s, tau=40*s)``\ncan represent a comb filter with the given delay and time constant, both in\nsamples, but with a more clear meaning for the reader than it would have with\nan expression like ``[1] + [0] * 239999 + [alpha]``. Would it be needed to\nstore all those zeros while just using the filter to get a frequency response\nplot?\n\nIt's possible to avoid some of these problems with well-chosen constants,\nduck typing, overloaded operators, functions as first-class citizens, object\noriented together with functional style programming, etc.., resources\nthat the Python language gives us for free.\n\nWhat does it do?\n----------------\n\nPrioritizing code expressiveness, clarity and simplicity, without precluding\nthe lazy evaluation, and aiming to be used together with Numpy, Scipy and\nMatplotlib as well as default Python structures like lists and generators,\nAudioLazy is a package written in pure Python proposing digital audio signal\nprocessing (DSP), featuring:\n\n- A ``Stream`` class for finite and endless signals representation with\n  elementwise operators (auto-broadcast with non-iterables) in a common\n  Python iterable container accepting heterogeneous data;\n- Strongly sample-based representation (Stream class) with easy conversion\n  to block representation using the ``Stream.blocks(size, hop)`` method;\n- Sample-based interactive processing with ``ControlStream``;\n- ``Streamix`` mixer for iterables given their starting time deltas;\n- Multi-thread audio I/O integration with PyAudio;\n- Linear filtering with Z-transform filters directly as equations (e.g.\n  ``filt = 1 / (1 - .3 * z ** -1)``), including linear time variant filters\n  (i.e., the ``a`` in ``a * z ** k`` can be a Stream instance), cascade\n  filters (behaves as a list of filters), resonators, etc.. Each\n  ``LinearFilter`` instance is compiled just in time when called;\n- Zeros and poles plots and frequency response plotting integration with\n  MatPlotLib;\n- Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) directly to ``ZFilter`` instances, from\n  which you can find PARCOR coeffs and LSFs;\n- Both sample-based (e.g., zero-cross rate, envelope, moving average,\n  clipping, unwrapping) and block-based (e.g., window functions, DFT,\n  autocorrelation, lag matrix) analysis and processing tools;\n- A simple synthesizer (Table lookup, Karplus-Strong) with processing tools\n  (Linear ADSR envelope, fade in/out, fixed duration line stream) and basic\n  wave data generation (sinusoid, white noise, impulse);\n- Biological auditory periphery modeling (ERB and gammatone filter models);\n- Multiple implementation organization as ``StrategyDict`` instances:\n  callable dictionaries that allows the same name to have several different\n  implementations (e.g. ``erb``, ``gammatone``, ``lowpass``, ``resonator``,\n  ``lpc``, ``window``);\n- Converters among MIDI pitch numbers, strings like \"F#4\" and frequencies;\n- Polynomials, Stream-based functions from itertools, math, cmath, and more!\n  Go try yourself! =)\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nThe package works both on Linux and on Windows. You can find the last stable\nversion at `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/audiolazy>`_ and install it with\nthe usual Python installing mechanism::\n\n  python setup.py install\n\nIf you have pip, you can go directly (use ``-U`` for update or reinstall)::\n\n  pip install audiolazy\n\nfor downloading (from PyPI) and installing the package for you, or::\n\n  pip install -U .\n\nTo install from a path that has the ``setup.py`` file and the package data\nuncompressed previously.\n\nFor the *bleeding-edge* version, you can install directly from the github\nrepository (requires ``git`` for cloning)::\n\n  pip install -U git+git://github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy.git\n\nFor older versions, you can install from the PyPI link or directly from the\ngithub repository, based on the repository tags. For example, to install the\nversion 0.04 (requires ``git`` for cloning)::\n\n  pip install -U git+git://github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy.git@v0.04\n\nThe package doesn't have any strong dependency for its core besides the Python\nitself (versions 2.7, 3.2 or newer) as well as its standard library, but you\nmight need:\n\n- PyAudio: needed for playing and recording audio (``AudioIO`` class);\n- NumPy: needed for doing some maths, such as finding the LSFs from a filter\n  or roots from a polynomial;\n- MatPlotLib: needed for all default plotting, like in ``LinearFilter.plot``\n  method and several examples;\n- SciPy (testing and examples only): used as an oracle for LTI filter testing\n  and for the Butterworth filter example;\n- Sympy (testing only): used for testing linear filters with time-varying\n  matrices of symbolic coeffs where the Stream samples are these matrices;\n- tox for testing all at once, or pytest, pytest-cov and pytest-timeout for\n  testing in a single environment (testing only): runs test suite and\n  shows code coverage status;\n- wxPython (example only): used by one example with FM synthesis in an\n  interactive GUI;\n- Tkinter (example only): needed for the pitch follower based on the\n  zero-crossing rate example GUI;\n- Music21 (example only): there's one example that gets the Bach chorals from\n  that package corpora for synthesizing and playing;\n- Sphinx (documentation only): it can create the software documentation in\n  several different file formats.\n\nBeside examples and tests, only the filter plotting with ``plot`` and\n``zplot`` methods needs MatPlotLib. Also, the routines that needs NumPy up to\nnow are:\n\n- Root finding with ``zeros`` and ``poles`` properties (filter classes) or\n  with ``roots`` property (Poly class);\n- Some Linear Predictive Coding (``lpc``) strategies: ``nautocor``,\n  ``autocor`` and ``covar``;\n- Line Spectral Frequencies ``lsf`` and ``lsf_stable`` functions.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nBefore all examples below, it's easier to get everything from audiolazy\nnamespace:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from audiolazy import *\n\nAll modules starts with \"lazy\\_\", but their data is already loaded in the main\nnamespace. These two lines of code do the same thing:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from audiolazy.lazy_stream import Stream\n  from audiolazy import Stream\n\nEndless iterables with operators (be careful with loops through an endless\niterator!):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  >>> a = Stream(2, -2, -1) # Periodic\n  >>> b = Stream(3, 7, 5, 4) # Periodic\n  >>> c = a + b # Elementwise sum, periodic\n  >>> c.take(15) # First 15 elements from the Stream object\n  [5, 5, 4, 6, 1, 6, 7, 2, 2, 9, 3, 3, 5, 5, 4]\n\nAnd also finite iterators (you can think on any Stream as a generator with\nelementwise operators):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  >>> a = Stream([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) # Finite, since it's a cast from an iterable\n  >>> b = Stream(3, 7, 5, 4) # Periodic\n  >>> c = a + b # Elementwise sum, finite\n  >>> list(c)\n  [4, 9, 8, 6, 4]\n\nLTI Filtering from system equations (Z-transform). After this, try summing,\ncomposing, multiplying ZFilter objects:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  >>> filt = 1 - z ** -1 # Diff between a sample and the previous one\n  >>> filt\n  1 - z^-1\n  >>> data = filt([.1, .2, .4, .3, .2, -.1, -.3, -.2]) # Past memory has 0.0\n  >>> data # This should have internally [.1, .1, .2, -.1, -.1, -.3, -.2, .1]\n  <audiolazy.lazy_stream.Stream object at ...>\n  >>> data *= 10 # Elementwise gain\n  >>> [int(round(x)) for x in data] # Streams are iterables\n  [1, 1, 2, -1, -1, -3, -2, 1]\n  >>> data_int = filt([1, 2, 4, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2], zero=0) # Now zero is int\n  >>> list(data_int)\n  [1, 1, 2, -1, -1, -3, -2, 1]\n\nLTI Filter frequency response plot (needs MatPlotLib):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  (1 + z ** -2).plot().show()\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy/master/images/filt_plot.png\n\nThe ``matplotlib.figure.Figure.show`` method won't work unless you're\nusing a newer version of MatPlotLib (works on MatPlotLib 1.2.0), but you still\ncan save the above plot directly to a PDF, PNG, etc. with older versions\n(e.g. MatPlotLib 1.0.1):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  (1 + z ** -2).plot().savefig(\"my_plot.pdf\")\n\nOn the other hand, you can always show the figure using MatPlotLib directly:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # Or \"import pylab as plt\"\n  filt = 1 + z ** -2\n  fig1 = filt.plot(plt.figure()) # Argument not needed on the first figure\n  fig2 = filt.zplot(plt.figure()) # The argument ensures a new figure\n  plt.show()\n\nCascadeFilter instances and ParallelFilter instances are lists of filters with\nthe same operator behavior as a list, and also works for plotting linear\nfilters. Constructors accepts both a filter and an iterable with filters.\nFor example, a zeros and poles plot (needs MatPlotLib):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  filt1 = CascadeFilter(0.2 - z ** -3) # 3 zeros\n  filt2 = CascadeFilter(1 / (1 -.8 * z ** -1 + .6 * z ** -2)) # 2 poles\n  # Here __add__ concatenates and __mul__ by an integer make reference copies\n  filt = (filt1 * 5 + filt2 * 10) # 15 zeros and 20 poles\n  filt.zplot().show()\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy/master/images/cascade_plot.png\n\nLinear Predictive Coding (LPC) autocorrelation method analysis filter\nfrequency response plot (needs MatPlotLib):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  lpc([1, -2, 3, -4, -3, 2, -3, 2, 1], order=3).plot().show()\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy/master/images/lpc_plot.png\n\nLinear Predictive Coding covariance method analysis and synthesis filter,\nfollowed by the frequency response plot together with block data DFT\n(MatPlotLib):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  >>> data = Stream(-1., 0., 1., 0.) # Periodic\n  >>> blk = data.take(200)\n  >>> analysis_filt = lpc.covar(blk, 4)\n  >>> analysis_filt\n  1 + 0.5 * z^-2 - 0.5 * z^-4\n  >>> residual = list(analysis_filt(blk))\n  >>> residual[:10]\n  [-1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n  >>> synth_filt = 1 / analysis_filt\n  >>> synth_filt(residual).take(10)\n  [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0]\n  >>> amplified_blk = list(Stream(blk) * -200) # For alignment w/ DFT\n  >>> synth_filt.plot(blk=amplified_blk).show()\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy/master/images/dft_lpc_plot.png\n\nAudioLazy doesn't need any audio card to process audio, but needs PyAudio to\nplay some sound:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  rate = 44100 # Sampling rate, in samples/second\n  s, Hz = sHz(rate) # Seconds and hertz\n  ms = 1e-3 * s\n  note1 = karplus_strong(440 * Hz) # Pluck \"digitar\" synth\n  note2 = zeros(300 * ms).append(karplus_strong(880 * Hz))\n  notes = (note1 + note2) * .5\n  sound = notes.take(int(2 * s)) # 2 seconds of a Karplus-Strong note\n  with AudioIO(True) as player: # True means \"wait for all sounds to stop\"\n    player.play(sound, rate=rate)\n\nSee also the docstrings and the \"examples\" directory at the github repository\nfor more help. Also, the huge test suite might help you understanding how the\npackage works and how to use it.\n\nProject files\n-------------\n\nThere are several files and directories in the AudioLazy repository (as well\nas in the source distribution):\n\n================ =============================================================\nFile/Directory   Description\n================ =============================================================\naudiolazy/       AudioLazy package modules source code\naudiolazy/tests/ Testing subpackage\ndocs/            Documentation generation scripts\nexamples/        Examples for some AudioLazy use cases\nimages/          Images referenced by some reStructuredText documentation file\nmath/            Proof for some formula used by AudioLazy using Sympy CAS\nCHANGES.rst      AudioLazy History, a.k.a. change log\nconftest.py      Configuration for py.test, to work properly with doctests on\n                 StrategyDict strategies and on an environment missing Numpy\nCOPYING.txt      License file\nMANIFEST.in      List of extra distributed files to be included in the tarball\n                 that doesn't need to be installed together with the package\nREADME.rst       Some general information about the AudioLazy project\nsetup.py         General Python setup script for installation, testing, etc.\ntox.ini          Configuration for tox, py.test and pytest-cov\n.travis.yml      Travis-CI configuration (not in PyPI tarball/\"egg\" source\n                 distribution)\n================ =============================================================\n\nThe ``examples`` and the ``math`` directories might be useful for an AudioLazy\nuser. All Python files in these two directories are scripts intended to run on\nboth Python 2 and 3 unless they need something not yet available for Python 3\n(e.g. wxPython), most of them have some external dependency.\n\nAudioLazy changes history\n-------------------------\n\n*** Version 0.6 (Examples, STFT, phon2dB, tox, CI, wave file) ***\n\n+ examples:\n\n  - Formant synthesis for voiced \"ah-eh-ee-oh-oo\"\n  - Musical keyboard synth example with a QWERTY keyboard (also via jack!)\n  - Random synthesis with saving and memoization\n  - Aesthetics for the Tkinter GUI examples\n  - Matplotlib animated plot with mic input data (also works via jack!)\n  - Perceptual experiment with butterworth filters (Scipy) applied to white\n    noise (based on the Demonstrations to Auditory Scene Analysis)\n  - Psychoacoustics using ISO/FDIS 226:2003\n\n    * Equal loudness contour curves plotting\n    * Constant phon chirp playing\n\n  - Partial recreation of the \"Windows and Figures of Merit\" F. Harris\n    comparison table and window plots\n  - Playing/synthesizing \"Ode to Joy\" from its \"score\" written as code\n  - All recording/playback examples now prepared for using both the default\n    API and receiving it as an argument like \"jack\" or \"alsa\"\n  - Realtime STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) effects:\n\n    * Robotize\n    * \"Roll\" the magnitude spectrum while keeping the phase\n\n+ general:\n\n  - Tox for testing with CPython 2.7, CPython 3.2~3.6 and PyPy\n  - Continuous integration wih Travis CI and Coveralls\n  - New ``_internals.py`` module to avoid exposing package internals together\n    with the API, which also allowed the new simplified ``__init__.py``\n  - Renewed setup.py in both its internals (e.g. using AST instead of\n    string manipulation to avoid importing the package before installation)\n    and its interface (e.g. the ``test`` command now calls ``tox``)\n  - New ``conftest.py`` for testing doctests from strategies inside\n    StrategyDict instances without the need of a ``__test__`` in the module\n    and for skipping doctests known to need Numpy when it's not available\n  - New ``math`` directory for adding scripts with symbolic math calculations\n    (with Sympy) done for designing (or as a proof) for parts of the\n    AudioLazy code. All lowpass and highpass strategies have their design\n    explicitly explained there\n\n+ lazy_analysis:\n\n  - New ``overlap_add`` StrategyDict instance, allowing resynth after block\n    processing/analysis, featuring block size auto-detection and window\n    normalization to keep the output in the [-1; 1] range. Has 2\n    implementations keeping the same interface:\n\n    * ``numpy`` (*default*): needs Numpy arrays internally\n    * ``list``: uses lists instead, doesn't need Numpy and was tested on Pypy\n\n  - New ``stft`` StrategyDict instance, allowing Short Time Fourier Transform\n    block processors / phase vocoder by:\n\n    * Passing a function as the first parameter\n    * Using a ``stft`` strategies as a decorator\n    * Creating new strategies by avoiding the only positional parameter\n\n    It was created with three Numpy-based strategies:\n\n    * ``rfft``, ``real`` or ``base`` (*default*): needs ``numpy.fft.rfft``\n      internally, as well as its inverse, to process a block in the\n      frequency domain with values up to the Nyquist frequency, by assuming\n      the input signal is real\n    * ``cfft`` or ``complex``: Alike to the default approach but uses the\n      ``numpy.fft.fft`` for a full complex-valued block in frequency domain,\n      which means the output is a complex signal\n    * ``cfftr`` or ``complex_real``: same to ``stft.cfft`` strategy, but\n      keeps only the real part of the result\n\n    Parameters allows changing the default zero-phase behavior (``before``\n    and ``after`` functions), the transform and inverse transform functions,\n    the overlap-add strategy (as well as its parameters), and obviously the\n    block size and hop\n\n  - The ``window`` StrategyDict now returns the \"periodic\" window data\n    instead of the \"symmetric\" window to be used with the STFT directly\n  - New ``wsymm`` StrategyDict with the same strategies from ``window`` but\n    returning a \"symmetric\" window\n  - Default ``window`` strategy is the Hann window (the same for ``wsymm``)\n  - New ``cos`` strategy for ``window`` and ``wsymm`` implementing cosine to\n    the power of alpha\n\n+ lazy_auditory:\n\n  - New ``phon2dB`` StrategyDict instance with the ISO/FDIS 226:2003 model\n    for getting a SPL (Sound Pressure Level) in dBs from a phon value\n\n+ lazy_core:\n\n  - Add support to the new ``@`` matrix multiplication operator\n  - ``OpMethod.get()`` now accepts numbers ``\"1\"`` and ``\"2\"`` as strings for\n    unary and binary query for operators, and ``\"all\"`` is the new default, so\n    ``OpMethod.get(without=\"2 ~\")`` would get all operators but the [reversed\n    or not] binary ones and the invert operator, which means it would yield\n    only the unary ``\"+\"`` (pos) and ``-`` (neg), as probably was expected;\n    OpMethod also had a bug fix regarding the shift operators\n  - Strategy name autocomplete works on IPython since StrategyDict now\n    changes its instance dictionary (e.g. ``vars(window)``) instead of\n    depending on the ``__getattr__`` method\n  - ``StrategyDict.strategy`` method now allows the strategy function name to\n    be kept by using the new ``keep_name`` keyword-only argument. It might be\n    helpful for adding built-in functions as well as other immutable\n    callables as multi-name strategies with the same behavior as the item\n    assignment for adding a strategy\n  - The default strategy in a StrategyDict instance is now removed when all\n    its keys/names are removed. The new default is the next added strategy\n  - Strategies can be removed both by their item name and their attribute,\n    and removing an attribute that isn't an strategy recovers the strategy\n    attribute if its name belongs to a strategy\n  - MultiKeyDict methods ``key2keys`` and ``value2keys`` to help getting a\n    tuple with all keys that points to the same value, ordered by the\n    insertion order\n\n+ lazy_filters:\n\n  - LinearFilter coefficients can now be a Stream of Numpy matrices, as well\n    as Sympy symbols (including symbolic matrices).\n  - New simple lowpass/highpass IIR filter strategies:\n\n    * ``highpass.z`` (taken as the new ``highpass`` default)\n    * ``lowpass.z``\n    * ``highpass.pole_exp``\n    * ``highpass.z_exp``\n    * ``lowpass.z_exp``\n\n    Where the ``\"z\"`` name denotes the presence of a single zero (besides the\n    single pole) and ``\"_exp\"`` denotes the exponential approximation from\n    a matched Z-Transform pole value from the equivalent or mirrored analog\n    filter equation (Laplace). The absence of such suffix denotes it was\n    designed directly as a digital filter.\n\n+ lazy_io:\n\n  - New ``api`` keyword argument for AudioIO, allowing e.g. integration with\n    JACK (for now this needs ``chunks.size = 1``)\n  - ``AudioIO.open`` and ``AudioIO.record`` now allows keyword arguments, to\n    be passed directly to PyAudio, including the now default \"channels\"\n    keyword (old \"nchannels\" keyword still works, for backward compatibility)\n\n+ lazy_math:\n\n  - Signal function ``sign`` now works on Python 3\n\n+ lazy_misc:\n\n  - New ``cached`` decorator caching the results for a function without\n    keyword arguments\n\n+ lazy_poly:\n\n  - Complex numbers and Sympy symbols can now be used as Poly powers\n  - Poly instances are now based on OrderedDict (stores the creation order\n    internally) and Poly.terms now support both a ``sort`` and a ``reverse``\n    keyword arguments to choose the yielding order (sorted by powers, keep\n    creation order or reverse any of these)\n  - Immutable Poly behavior is now based on a cached frozenset (doesn't depend\n    on the terms order) and includes Poly.zero as a read-only property (after\n    the hash is required)\n  - The Horner-like polynomial evaluation scheme (which needs sorting) is now\n    enabled/disabled via a keyword argument. By default, it's enabled just for\n    simple polynomials, but optional when powers are sortable (e.g. in a\n    Laurent polynomial)\n\n+ lazy_text:\n\n  - New ``format_docstring`` decorator that use format-style templates to\n    assign docstrings to functions, intended to avoid docstring copies on\n    StrategyDict instances.\n\n+ lazy_wav (*new!*):\n\n  - ``WavStream`` class for opening Wave files. Can load 24-bit audio files!\n    Tested with 8 bits files (unsigned int) and 16/24/32 bits (signed int)\n    mono and stereo files, both casting the data to a float in [-1;1) interval\n    (default) and keeping the original integer data as it is\n\n+ multiple modules:\n\n  - (*lazy_math and lazy_stream*) Renamed the elementwised ``abs`` to\n    ``absolute``, so no Python built-in name is ever replaced when importing\n    with ``from audiolazy import *``. Also, the built-in ``abs`` now can be\n    used directly with Stream instances\n  - (*lazy_analysis and lazy_misc*) Renamed ``freq2lag`` and ``lag2freq`` to\n    use ``2`` instead of ``_to_``, and moved them to lazy_misc\n\n\n*** Version 0.05 (Python 2 & 3, more examples, refactoring, polinomials) ***\n\n+ examples:\n\n  - Pitch follower via zero-crossing rate with Tkinter GUI\n  - Pi with Madhava-Gregory-Leibniz series and Machin formula using Stream\n  - LPC plot with DFT, showing two formants (magnitude peaks)\n  - A somehow disturbing example based on Shepard \"going higher\" tone\n  - Linear Periodically Time Variant filter example\n  - Now the Bach choral player can play in loop\n  - New DFT-based pitch follower (guitar tuner like) and better ZCR-based\n    pitch follower by using a simple limiter\n  - Butterworth filter from SciPy as a ZFilter instance, with plots\n\n+ general:\n\n  - Now with 82% code coverage in tests\n  - Mock testing for audio output\n  - Bugfixes (``envelope.abs``, ``midi2str``, ``StreamTeeHub.blocks``, etc.)\n  - Extended domain for some functions by using ``inf`` and ``nan``\n  - Removed deprecated ``Stream.tee()`` method\n  - Constants ``DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`` and ``LATEX_PI_SYMBOL`` were removed:\n    the default values are now changeable and inside ``chunks`` and\n    ``float_str``, respectively (see docstrings for more details)\n  - No more distinction between ``__div__`` and ``__truediv__`` (Python 2.7)\n  - Now AudioLazy works with Python 3.2 and 3.3!\n  - Test skipping for tests that depends upon something that is Python\n    version-specific\n  - Test \"xfail\" using XFailer classes when depending package (e.g. pyaudio)\n    is unavailable in the testing environment\n\n+ lazy_compat (*new!*):\n\n  - Module for Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility resources (constants\n    and functions) without AudioLazy dependencies (i.e., no Stream here)\n  - Common place for iterable-based version of itertools/built-ins in both\n    Python 2 and 3 starting with \"x\": ``xmap``, ``xfilter``, ``xzip``,\n    ``xrange``, ``xzip_longest``. Versions with \"i\" are kept in lazy_itertools\n    module to return Stream instances (``imap``, ``izip``, ``izip.longest``,\n    etc.), and Python 2 list-based behaviour of ``range`` is kept as\n    ``orange`` (a fruitful name)\n  - New ``meta`` function for creating metaclasses always in a \"Python 3\n    look-alike\" style, keeping the semantics (including the inheritance\n    hierarchy, which won't have any extra \"dummy\" class)\n\n+ lazy_core:\n\n  - New ``OpMethod`` class with 33 operator method instances and querying\n  - Changed ``AbstractOperatorOverloaderMeta`` to the new OpMethod-based\n    interface\n  - Now StrategyDict changes the module ``__test__`` so that doctests from\n    strategies are found by the doctest finder.\n\n+ lazy_filters:\n\n  - ZFilter instances are now better prepared for Stream coeffs and\n    operator-based filter creation, as well as a new copy helper method\n  - Filters are now hashable (e.g., they can be used in sets)\n\n+ lazy_io:\n\n  - New RecStream class for recording Stream instances with a ``stop`` method\n  - Now chunks is a StrategyDict here, instead of two lazy_misc functions\n  - Now the default chunk size is stored in chunks.size, and can be changed\n\n+ lazy_itertools:\n\n  - New ``accumulate`` itertool from Python 3, available also in Python 2\n    yielding a Stream. This is a new StrategyDict with one more strategy in\n    Python 3\n  - Strategy ``chain.from_iterable`` is now available (Stream version\n    itertool), and ``chain`` is now a StrategyDict\n  - Now ``izip`` is a StrategyDict, with ``izip.smallest`` (*default*) and\n    ``izip.longest`` strategies\n\n+ lazy_misc:\n\n  - New ``rint`` for \"round integer\" operations as well as other higher step\n    integer quantization\n  - Now ``almost_eq`` is a single StrategyDict with both ``bits`` (*default*,\n    comparison by significand/mantissa bits) and ``diff`` (absolute value\n    difference) strategies\n\n+ lazy_poly:\n\n  - New ``x`` Poly object (to be used like the ``z`` ZFilter instance)\n  - Waring-Lagrange polynomial interpolator StrategyDict\n  - General resample based on Waring-Lagrange interpolators, working with\n    time-varying sample rate\n  - New methods ``Poly.is_polynomial()`` and ``Poly.is_laurent()``\n  - New property ``Poly.order`` for common polynomials\n  - Now ``Poly.integrate()`` and ``Poly.diff()`` methods returns Poly\n    instances, and the ``zero`` from the caller Poly is always kept in\n    result (this includes many bugfixes)\n  - Poly instances are now better prepared for Stream coeffs and evaluation,\n    including a helper ``Poly.copy()`` method\n  - Poly is now hashable and have __setitem__ (using both isn't allowed for\n    the same instance)\n\n+ lazy_stream:\n\n  - Stream.take now accepts floats, so with first ``sHz`` output as\n    ``s`` (for second) you can now use ``my_stream.take(20 * s)`` directly,\n    as well as a \"take all\" feature ``my_stream.take(inf)``\n  - New ``Stream.peek()`` method, allowing taking items while keeping them\n    as the next to be yielded by the Stream or StreamTeeHub\n  - New ``Stream.skip()`` method for neglecting the leading items without\n    storing them\n  - New ``Stream.limit()`` method, to enforce a maximum \"length\"\n  - StreamTeeHub methods ``skip()``, ``limit()``, ``append()``, ``map()`` and\n    ``filter()`` returns the modified copy as a Stream instance (i.e., works\n    like ``Stream(my_stream_tee_hub).method_name()``)\n  - Control over the module name in ``tostream`` (needed for lazy_itertools)\n\n+ lazy_synth:\n\n  - Input \"dur\" in ``ones()``, ``zeros()``, ``white_noise()`` and\n    ``impulse()`` now can be inf (besides None)\n  - Impulse now have ``one=1.`` and ``zero=0.`` arguments\n  - New ``gauss_noise`` for Normal / Gaussian-distributed noise\n  - White-noise limits parametrization\n\n+ lazy_text (*new!*):\n\n  - Got all text/string formatting functions from lazy_misc\n  - Namespace clean-up: new StrategyDict ``float_str`` embraces older\n    rational/pi/auto formatters in one instance\n\n*** Version 0.04 (Documentation, LPC, Plots!) ***\n\n+ examples:\n\n  - Random Bach Choral playing example (needs Music21 corpus)\n\n+ general:\n\n  - Sphinx documentation!\n  - Self-generated package and module summary at the docstring\n  - Integration with NumPy (tested on 1.5.0, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) and MatPlotLib\n    (tested on 1.0.1 and 1.2.0)\n  - More docstrings and doctests, besides lots of corrections\n  - Itemized package description, installation instructions and getting\n    started examples with plots in README.rst\n  - Now with 5400+ tests and 75% code coverage\n\n+ lazy_analysis:\n\n  - One-dimensional autocorrelation function with ``acorr`` and lag\n    \"covariance\" (due to lpc.covar) with ``lag_matrix``\n  - DFT for any frequency, given a block\n  - Three envelope filtering strategies (time domain)\n  - Three moving average filter strategies\n  - Signal clipping function\n  - Signal unwrap, defaults to the ``2 * pi`` radians range but configurable\n    to other units and max signal difference allowed\n  - New AMDF algorithm as a non-linear filter\n\n+ lazy_core:\n\n  - StrategyDict instances now are singletons of a new class, which have\n    lazy non-memoized docstrings based on their contents\n\n+ lazy_filters:\n\n  - ZFilter composition/substitution, e.g., ``(1 + z ** -1)(1 / z)`` results\n    to the ZFilter instance ``1 + z``\n  - New LinearFilter.plot() directly plots the frequency response of a LTI\n    filter to a MatPlotLib figure.
