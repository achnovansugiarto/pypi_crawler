    "description": "rbackupd\n========\n\nrbackupd is a backup program for linux using rsync. It creates \"snapshots\" of\nthe filesystem that contain all files and directories of that filesystem at the\ntime of the snapshot. To reduce the required disk space, files that have not\nchanged since the last snapshot are hardlinked into the new snapshot.\n\nYou can specify multiple intervals in which snapshots will be created, and a\nmaximum number of backups that should be kept for every interval. Intervals\ncan be given in a cron-like format, which means you have great flexibility in\nspecifiying these intervals.\n\nThanks to rsync, rbackupd will preserve hard links, special files such as named\nsockets and fifos, device files, permissions, ownership, modification times,\nACLs and extended attributes.\n\nAs the snapshots are neither compressed nor encrypted by rbackupd, every user\ncan access all files owned by him without requiring root privileges.\n\nrbackupd is written in python, for version 3.3.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- a POSIX compatible operating system\n- rsync v2.5.7 or later\n- python v3.3 or later\n- a filesystem supporting hardlinks\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n``rbackupd <configuration file>``\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nLook into doc/ for more detailed documentation.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSee INSTALL for installation information.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\nSee AUTHORS for a list of authors.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nSee CHANGELOG for a complete changelog.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nrbackupd is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. See\nLICENSE for a copy of the GPL.\n\nContact\n-------\n\ne-mail: hannes.koerber+rbackupd@gmail.com",
