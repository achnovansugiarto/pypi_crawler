Coif (_**Co**ver **i**mage **f**inder_) is a simple Python&nbsp;3 library that looks for cover images using multiple network services. When it finds one, Coif returns the image in [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) format.\n\nCoif is most similar to [bookcovers](https://github.com/e-e-e/bookcovers), a JavaScript library that performs federated search for book cover images. A Python package similar to Coif is [booker](https://github.com/krdyke/booker), but that one is limited to searching Google Books.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe instructions below assume you have a Python interpreter installed on your computer; if that's not the case, please first [install Python version 3](INSTALL-Python3.md) and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system.\n\nOn **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** operating systems, you should be able to install `coif` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).  To install `coif` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following command:\n```\npython3 -m pip install coif\n```\n\nAs an alternative to getting it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can use `pip` to install `coif` directly from GitHub, like this:\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/coif.git\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nCoif currently offers only an application programming interface (API); it does not offer a command-line interface. The main interface point is the function `cover_image(...)`. Here is a simple demonstration of using it:\n\n```python\nfrom coif import cover_image\n\n(url, image) = cover_image('9781479837243')\nif image:\n    with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as image_file:\n        image_file.write(image)\nelse:\n    print('Unable to find image')\n```\n\nAs illustrated above, `cover_image` returns **two** values: a URL, and a JPEG image in binary form (if a cover image is found).\n\n\n### Arguments to `cover_image`\n\nThe function takes one required argument, an identifier (preferably an [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number), but possibly other kinds of identifiers), and additional optional arguments. In more detail, the possible arguments are:\n\n* `identifier` (required): an ISBN, OCLC id, LCCN id, OLID and or Open Library [Cover ID](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers). Note that only Open Library accepts anything other than ISBN, so your best bet for finding a cover image is to use an ISBN. Conversely, if you provide anything other than an ISBN, `cover_image` will only contact Open Library.\n* `kind` (optional): the kind of identifier given as the first argument. Recognized values are `isbn`, `lccn`, `olid`, `oclc`, and `coverid`. The default is `isbn`.\n* `size` (optional): one of the letters `S`, `M`, or `L`, to indicate a preference for small, medium, or large images, respectively. Some cover images may exist in one size and not another, and there is no way to know in advance which size may be available from a service without actually downloading the image. If a `size` is provided, `cover_image` will ask for that size _and smaller_; for example, if you call it with `size = 'M'`, it will try to find `M` first and if none exists, it will try `S`. By default, it wil _only_ try `S`. If you want to get the largest image you can find, call it with `size = 'L'`.\n* `cc_login` (optional): one of the best services for finding cover images is [Content Cafè 2](http://www.baker-taylor.com/pdfs/content_cafe.pdf) from Baker & Talor, but it requires an account. If you have a user id and password with their service, provide the credentials as a tuple of values `(\"user\", \"password\")` to the optional argument `cc_login`.\n\n\n### Why `cover_image` always returns an image\n\nA frustrating aspect of many of the services is that they provide no way to simply ask whether an image exists. If the services do not have an image for a given identifier, most return a small placeholder image (often containing rendered text to the effect of \"no cover found\") instead of returning a failure code of some kind. Consequently, `cover_image` must always download images and test them against some size thresholds to determine if it got a placeholder or an actual cover image. This is the reason why the return values from `cover_image` are both a URL and an image: it has already downloaded the image, so it may as well return it, to save the caller the trouble of downloading the image a second time.\n\n\n## Known issues and limitations\n\nAlthough the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) accepts multiple types of identifiers such as an ISBN, OCLC, LCCN, and more, other services only accept ISBNs. Thus, while you can pass any of these types of identifiers to Coif, if what you use is _not_ an ISBN, then Coif will only contact the Open Library's service.\n\n\n## Getting help\n\nIf you find an issue, please submit it in [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/coif/issues) for this repository.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would be happy to receive your help and participation with enhancing Coif!
