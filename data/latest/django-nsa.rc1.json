    "description": "# NSA app for Django\n\n![](nsa-eagle.png)\n\nAn easy way for the NSA to see what's going on in our Django projects.\nLet's ~~destroy the right to privacy~~ fight terrorism together!\n\n## Freedom matters.\n\nThis particular app was written to join the forces of @goshakkk's [nsa_panel](https://github.com/goshakkk/nsa_panel) for Ruby on Rails and \n@plausibility's [flask-nsa](https://github.com/plausibility/flask-nsa) for Flask.\n\n## Enforce.\n\nAdd `nsa` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` to your project's `settings.py` file.  \nAnd this to your project's `urls.py` file: `url(r'^nsa/', include('nsa.urls'))`  \nTest if everything is free as it should be: [http://localhost:8000/nsa](http://localhost:8000/nsa) (Use nsa/nsa as credentials).\n\n## Enjoy.\n\nShare the ~~end of privacy~~ good news (or don't, after all users shouldn't know too much):\n\n> Dear X users, \n\n> You may be aware of reports alleging that X and several other Internet\n> companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to\n> give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. We would\n> like to respond to the press reports, and give you the facts. \n\n> X is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any\n> other government direct access to our servers. We have never received a\n> blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for\n> information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly\n> received. We hadn't even heard of PRISM before yesterday. \n\n> When governments ask X for data, we review each request carefully to\n> make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable\n> laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We\n> will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and\n> secure. Any suggestion that X is disclosing information about our users’\n> Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. \n\n> We strongly encourage all governments to be much more transparent about\n> all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It's the only way to\n> protect everyone's civil liberties and create the safe and free society\n> we all want over the long term. We here at X understand that the U.S.\n> and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’\n> safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of\n> secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we\n> all cherish.\n\n\\o/ yay.\n\n## How it looks like.\n\n![Confirm they have a warrant](0-confirm-warrant.png)\n\n![Dashboard](1-dashboard.png)\n\n![User details](2-user-details.png)\n\n![User's secrets](3-users-secrets.png)\n\n![User's secret](4-users-secrets.png)\n\n## Inspiration.\n\n* [flask-nsa](https://github.com/plausibility/flask-nsa) by @plausibility.\n* [nsa_panel](https://github.com/goshakkk/nsa_panel) by @goshakkk.\n\n\n## Pypi.\n\n* [django-nsa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nsa)\n\n\n## License.\n\n[MIT](LICENSE).\n\nNSA Eagle Logo credit [EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/eff-nsa-graphics).  \nCSS and base Templates [flask-nsa](https://github.com/plausibility/flask-nsa) and [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/).  \n`icon-yes.gif` and `icon-no.gif` [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/).",
