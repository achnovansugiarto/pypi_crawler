    "description": "============================\ncollective.facebook.portlets\n============================\n\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\n   :depth: 2\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis package implements some `Facebook`_ `Social Plugins`_ as portlets for\nyour Plone site.\n\nThis package depends on `collective.facebook.accounts`_.\n\nCurrently, the following portlets are available:\n\nFacebook Wall portlet\n    This portlet displays the user's Facebook Wall and their News Feed.\n\nFacebook Activity Feed portlet\n    This portlet is based on the Activity Feed plugin and it has some UI\n    limitations. The Activity Feed plugin displays the most interesting recent\n    activity taking place on your site. Since the content is hosted by\n    Facebook, the plugin can display personalized content whether or not the\n    user has logged into your site. The activity feed displays stories when\n    users interact with content on your site, such as like, watch, read, play\n    or any custom action. Activity is also displayed when users share content\n    from your site in Facebook or if they comment on a page on your site in\n    the Comments box. If a user is logged into Facebook, the plugin will be\n    personalized to highlight content from their friends. If the user is\n    logged out, the activity feed will show recommendations from across your\n    site, and give the user the option to log in to Facebook.\n\nDon't panic\n-----------\n\nFacebook Wall portlet\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo add a Facebook Wall portlet do the following:\n\n- From the manage portlets screen select \"Facebook Wall\".\n- Enter a header (if you want one).\n- Choose the Facebook account to use from the drop-down.\n- Enter the ID of the wall you want to be listed (e.g. plonecms).\n- Enter the maximum number of entries you want the portlet to show.\n- Mark the checkbox if you want only the posts made from the wall owner to be\n  shown (plonecms in this case), or leave it unmarked if you want all posts no\n  matter who posted them.\n\nThat's it.\n\nFacebook Activity Feed portlet\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo add a Facebook Activity Feed portlet do the following:\n\n- From the manage portlets screen select \"Facebook Activity Feed\".\n- Enter a header (if you want one).\n- Enter App ID/API Key of your application.\n- Enter the site URL from which you want to display interesting recent\n  activity (e.g. plone.org).\n- Select if you want to show recommendations from across your site.\n- Set the portlet width and height.\n- Select the color scheme you want to use: light or dark.\n- Select the link target you want to use: _blank, _top or _parent.\n- Enter the border color in hexadecimal format (e.g. #ffffff).\n\nThat's it.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/collective/collective.facebook.portlets/raw/master/wall.png\n    :align: center\n    :height: 582px\n    :width: 263px\n\n    Facebook Wall portlet.\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/collective/collective.facebook.portlets/raw/master/activity.png\n    :align: center\n    :height: 362px\n    :width: 260px\n\n    Facebook Activity Feed portlet.\n\nTo do list\n----------\n\nIn the near future we are going to release a new version including the\nfollowing features:\n\n`Recommendations Box portlet`_\n    This portlet will be based on the Recommendations Box plugin. The\n    Recommendations Box shows personalized recommendations to your users.\n    Since the content is hosted by Facebook, the plugin can display\n    personalized recommendations whether or not the user has logged into your\n    site. To generate the recommendations, the plugin considers all the social\n    interactions with URLs from your site. For a logged in Facebook user, the\n    plugin will give preference to and highlight objects her friends have\n    interacted with.\n\n.. _`collective.facebook.accounts`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.facebook.accounts\n.. _`Facebook`: http://www.facebook.com/\n.. _`Social Plugins`: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/\n.. _`Recommendations Box portlet`: https://github.com/collective/collective.facebook.portlets/issues/2\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo enable this product in a buildout-based installation:\n\n1.
