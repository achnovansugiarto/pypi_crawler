    "description": "[![Build Status](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)\n<!-- TODO: Add PyPI badge -->\n\n# restrained-ESP-fit\n\nThis is a fork of the `resp` program commonly used in computational chemistry for fitting partial atomic charges to values of the provided molecular Electrostatic Potential (ESP) field around a molecule.\nThe method was first described by Bayly et al.¹ using the MK mesh of sampling the ESP field² but the program can generally fit charges to any mesh of points.\nThe mesh needs to be produced independently; see the [jszopi/repESP](https://github.com/jszopi/repESP) repo for some helpers, including extracting ESP fitting points from the output of the Gaussian program and wrapping the calls to the `resp` program in a Python library.\nThe program can also be used to fit partial charges to the ESP without any restraints.\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe purpose of this fork is twofold: easier distribution of the original `resp` program as well as evolution independent from it.\n\n## Relation to `resp`\n\nMultiple versions of `resp` have appeared over the years and this project aims to make available the code for the newer versions.\nVersions `2.y.z` of this project will wrap the corresponding `resp 2.y` code without even a trivial modification.\nThe patch version (the `z`) will be incremented upon changes to the wrapping code and CI/CD pipeline.\nIf the `resp` program ever comes to use a patch version, the changes will be included in the next patch version of this project.\nWhile this will cause the version number to no longer have verbatim correspondence, this state should be acceptable, as users the upstream project should never introduce significant changes in a patch release and clients shouldn't have to pin a patch version.\n\n### Original `resp` code\n\nCode history prior to `v2.2` was not preserved (or rather, reconstructed, considering lack of a version controlled repo).\nThe original code for `v2.2` and `v2.4` can be found verbatim in the first two git commits of this repo.\nThey can be accessed through the corresponding git tags, namely [here for `v2.2`](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/tree/v2.2) and [here for `v2.4`](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/tree/v2.4).\nAlso see the corresponding Releases for details on how the code was retrieved ([`v2.2`](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/releases/tag/v2.2), [`v2.4`](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/releases/tag/v2.4))\n\nLater iterations of this project moved the original `resp` code into the `resp` subdirectory.\nAs the wrapping code evolves, packages will continue to be produced for versions `2.2.z`, `2.4.z` and any future `resp` versions from upstream.\n\n## Independent evolution\n\nIn order to allow for independent evolution of the program, the name of the project, `restrained-ESP-fit` is different from `resp`.\nThe version numbering of the project will reflect the separation from the `resp` version numbers, most likely by using a new major version, i.e. starting from `3.0.0`.\nThese versions of the project may alter the calculation logic (the results should be identical, barring potential bug fixes) and the interface to the program.\nI am hoping to rewrite this program in Python in order to encourage users to experiment with their own fitting methods and constraints.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Install\n\nIn addition to a publicly available source code, this project is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI).\nThis is partly due to the planned rewrite in Python.\nI also found the binary distribution format for Python (\"wheels\") a simpler alternative to distributing the project over each operating system's package manager.\nThe project is currently available for most Linux distributions and macOS X.\nIt should be possible for the Windows binaries to be available too; please open an issue if that would be useful to you.\n\nIn order to install this project, you only have to run:\n\n```sh\npip3 install restrained-ESP-fit\n```\n\n`pip3` will prefer installing from a binary distribution, if one compatible with your operating system is available.\nIf one is not available, `pip3` will attempt to compile the Fortran code locally.\nThis may or may not work, depending on whether the build dependencies can be found on your system.\n\n### Request compatible binaries\n\nOne of the aims of this projects is for local compilation not be necessary.\nIf installation failed, please open an issue including the output of `pip3 -v install restrained-ESP-fit` and the version numbers of your operating system, Python installation and `pip3`.\nHopefully, all that's required is the project maintainer adding your operating system to the CI/CD pipeline without requiring any changes on your side.\n\n### Compile from source\n\nIf you don't want to wait for compatible binaries to be provided, you can try to get the compilation from source working on your end.\nOne reason why the compilation may have failed is that `gfortran` is not in your `$PATH`.\nYou may need to use a different compiler by setting the `RESP_COMPILER` environment variable prior to invoking pip.\nRefer to the [CI/CD recipe](./.github/workflows/main.yml) for what value may be suitable for your operating system.\nFor example, on macOS X:\n\n```sh\nRESP_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-11 pip3 install restrained-ESP-fit\n```\n\nFor the sake of producing portable binaries, the `resp` program can be linked statically by setting `RESP_STATIC` environment variable to \"1\".\nThe libraries linked statically are `libgfortran` and `libquadmath`.\nYou are required to provide the path to where these static libraries can be found by setting the `RESP_VPATH` variable.\nNotice that linking statically uses a different Makefile, and its default compiler is `gcc` instead of `gfortran`.\n\n### Install alternate version\n\nFor reproducibility, you may need to install another version of `restrained-ESP-fit`.\nFor example, there are some input format differences between `resp` versions `2.2` and `2.4`.\nTo install the latest patch version of `2.2`, run:\n\n\n```sh\npip3 install 'restrained-ESP-fit>=2.2.0,<2.3.0'\n```\n\n## Run\n\nCurrently, the only interface to the program is invoking the `restrained-ESP-fit` script.\nIts interface is identical to that of the corresponding `resp` program, e.g. for `v2.4.z`:\n\n```\nrestrained-ESP-fit [-O] -i input -e espot [-o output -p punch -q qin -t qout -w qwts -s esout -j espdb -y esqpotpdb -z esmpotpdb]\n```\n\nMore detailed usage instructions are only available for v2.2 and are hosted at https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/resp/ (if link is down, get your browser to display [the repo version](https://github.com/jszopi/restrained-ESP-fit/blob/v2.2/resp-2.2.html)).\nThe usage of v2.4 is likely very similar, but so far I have identified at least one discrepancy in the expected input format.\nv2.4 was also distributed with the [`README-2.4.txt` file](https://github.com/jszopi/resp/blob/v2.4.1/resp/README-2.4.txt) file.\n\nSubsequent patch versions may introduce Python bindings, at first with arguments corresponding directly to the command line options and subsequently a more Pythonic interface.\n\n# Contributing\n\n`resp` has been the effort of multiple people; this fork is merely a spare time project of one developer.\nDue to the maturity of `resp`, the maintenance workload should be manageable, but any new features may come slowly.\nIf you'd like to help out, please get in touch.\nThe design of a Pythonic API and a later Python rewrite are interesting challenges that would definitely benefit from more help.\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment takes place on the `master` branch.\nThe `resp` version currently being wrapped on `master` is `2.4`, but this may change to a newer minor version if one is released upstream.\nTo continue producing packages wrapping multiple `resp` versions, branches `v2.2.z` and `v2.4.z` will be updated with any new developments from `master`.\nThese will likely cease to be supported when the development of version `3.0` starts.\n\n--- \n\n¹ C.
