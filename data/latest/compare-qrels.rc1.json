    "description": "# compare-qrels\nQualitatively compare the qrels results of two IR systems.\n\n## Why use this?\nDetermining whether one has progressed in IR is often done based on improvement on mean metrics - the mean of certain\nmetrics across queries - such as MRR, micro-recall or micro-precision. If a new model slightly significantly\noutperforms an old model on these mean metrics, it is often concluded that the new model is better. \nStatistical significance is insufficient to prove that one system outperforms another in offline \nevaluation, because the characteristics of your query set may not perfectly reflect queries from \"real\" users. \nIf the new model fails at queries that the old model could handle very well and if those types of queries \nare overrepresented in queries  of \"real\" users, your system may have significantly outperform in an \noffline setting, but fails to transfer those results into an online setting.\nResearchers should take this possibility into account by **qualitatively assessing the strengths and weaknesses** between different methods and models.\n\nMean metrics can obscure the following characteristics on systems: \n\n- **Specialisation**: in the figure the models perform well on different types of queries, i.e.  specialisation. Comparing these models\n  is difficult or nonsensical, because they could serve different goals/domains/queries. Specialisation can be quickly\n  observed when plotting, for instance,\n  the ∆recall in a histogram.  If most queries have a high positive or negative ∆recall, then\n  the models are specialised on different queries.\n  \n  ![Specialisation](images/diff.png)\n- **Distributed performance**: the figure shows a situation in which model A performs well on all queries whereas \n  model  B  performs  perfect  on  some  queries,  but  fails  at  others.   Concluding  that  model  B  is \n  better than model A could be premature.  When Conversational Passage Ranking (CPR) is being used\n  in  a  ConvQA  system  to  fulfil  a  user’s  information  need,  a  few  documents  might  be  enough  to  provide\n  an  answer  for  each  query.   Then  it  is  preferred  that  a  Conversational  Passage  Ranking  (CPR)  system\n  performs well on a wide range of queries instead of specialising on a few.  An example of such a system is asearch engine like Google.  As a user, it is preferred to have some relevant documents for all your queries.Distributed performance can be quickly observed when plotting, for instance, the recall in a histogramlike in figure 4c.  If most queries have a medium recall score instead of either a high or a low score, themodel performs distributively overall.\n  \n  ![Distributed performance](images/average.png)\n- **Search space overlap**:  the recall scores of two systems hide the information about which documents\nare retrieved. This information can be gained by computing the overlap of retrieved documents of two\nmodels. The figure illustrates the case in which the recall scores as the same, but the overlap is different.  In\nthe left case, the models find roughly the same documents, but model A finds more relevant documents\nthan model B, i.e.  the results of A are a super set of the results of B. Then it is fair to conclude that\nmodel A is better than model B. However, if the overlap is low as illustrated in the right case, both models\nfind different relevant documents, i.e.  the models are complementary.  When the goal of a system is total\nrecall, for instance in legal IR, not one model but both models should be used.\n\n![Overlap](images/overlap.png)\n\n## How to use\n\nSee [sample_compare_qrels.py](sample_compare_qrels.py).\n\n## Example output\nThe example output is the output of comparing two Conversational Passage Retrieval systems.\n\n\n### Figures\n![](output/delta.png)\n![](output/delta_metric_hist.png)\n![](output/metric_hist.png)\n![](output/overlap.png)\n\n### Terminal output\n\n```shell script\nMean scores QuReTec (trained) {'map': 0.15798155213698378, 'recip_rank': 0.4623152325205058, 'recall_1000': 0.5586410184663372}\nMean scores Query Rewriting {'map': 0.18083664899945048, 'recip_rank': 0.47347866813888656, 'recall_1000': 0.611948585919043}\n\n52 easy queries (recall_1000 > 0.8) for both methods:\n8 with low overlap (<40.0%), 38 with high overlap (>=60.0%) and 6 with medium overlap (>=40.0% and <60.0%)\n      qid  percentage                                              topic  recall_1000_1  recall_1000_2\n0    31_1     100.000                             What is throat cancer?
