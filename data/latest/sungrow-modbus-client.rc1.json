    "description": "# Sungrow Monitor\nA python 3 module to allow direct monitoring of sungrow inverters over LAN TCP modbus connections.\n\nBased on a modified version of [thomasfa18 script](https://github.com/thomasfa18/solar-sungrow) please check out their work if you are interested in a solution to upload data to [pvoutput.org](pvoutput.org).\n\nBased on a cut down version of [Meltaxa's solarIoT script](https://github.com/meltaxa/solariot) please check out their work if you are interested in a full on prememsis solution.\n\nThe modbus map was generated from the official sungrow modbus specification and contains many registers. These are present simply as a register index to make it easier for anyone else that is looking for the information.\n\n## Getting started\n```python\nfrom SungrowModbusClient import Client, sungrow_register\n\nc = Client(sungrow_register.regmap, \"192.168.0.120\", 502)\n\nc.load_register()\n\nfor i in c.inverter:\n    print(i, c.inverter[i])\n```\n\n## Standard Disclaimer\nAll Content on this site is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or the warranty of non-infringement.

It may work with other devices, I do not know.\n  - The script only performs reads of the input registers (function code 04), if you do not know anything about modbus I would highly dicourage you from making changes.\n  - In short, you are welcome to use this, but if you do you are agreeing that if something bad happens then it was not my fault and you can't sue me.\n\n\n",
