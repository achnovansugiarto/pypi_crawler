    "description": "Gallery Widget for Kivy\n=======================\n\n[![Github Build Status](https://github.com/ebs-universe/kivy_garden.ebs.gallery/workflows/Garden%20flower/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ebs-universe/kivy_garden.ebs.gallery/actions)\n\nThis package provides half of a simple Image Gallery / Carousel widget for \nKivy. The other half is provided by the EBS linuxnode GalleryManager class. \n\nMost non-EBS applications would not benefit from this widget. The functionality \nprovided here can just as easily be obtained by use of the Kivy ScreenManager \nwidget, which also considerably more flexible. The reason ScreenManager was not\nused here is primarily because I hadn't seen ScreenManager yet when the Image Gallery \nwas first written. This widget may not be used in the future by the EBS Image Gallery, \nand if it is not, it will no longer be maintained.\n\nThis package is part of the EBS widget collection for Kivy. It is written in \nmostly Python and depends on the EBS core widgets and widget infrastructure package. \nFor more information, see [kivy_garden.ebs.core](https://github.com/ebs-universe/kivy_garden.ebs.core)\n\nSee https://kivy-garden.github.io/ebs.flower/ for the rendered flower docs.\n\nPlease see the garden [instructions](https://kivy-garden.github.io) for \nhow to use kivy garden flowers.\n\n\nCI\n--\n\nEvery push or pull request run the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/kivy-garden/flower/actions) CI.\nIt tests the code on various OS and also generates wheels that can be released on PyPI upon a\ntag. Docs are also generated and uploaded to the repo as well as artifacts of the CI.\n\n\nTODO\n-------\n\n* add your code\n\nContributing\n--------------\n\nCheck out our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to improve the flower.\n\nLicense\n---------\n\nThis software is released under the terms of the MIT License.\nPlease see the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file.\n\nHow to release\n===============\n\nSee the garden [instructions](https://kivy-garden.github.io/#makingareleaseforyourflower) for how to make a new release.",
