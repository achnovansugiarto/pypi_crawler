It is designed to parse, translate, and synthesize diverse observations from well-curated repositories into standardized formats for scientific uses such as analysis and visualization.\n\nbasin3d is the core BASIN-3D application that uses a generalized data synthesis model that applies across a variety of earth science observation types (hydrology, geochemistry, climate etc.). \n\nbasin3d has available plugins that can connect to specific data sources of interest, and map the data source vocabularies to the basin3d synthesis models.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Install\n\nInstall a source distribution with pip:\n\n    $ pip install basin3d\n    \nMake sure your installation was successful:\n\n    $ python\n    >>> import basin3d\n    >>>\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee latest basin3d documentation [here](https://basin3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf youâ€™re interested in contributing to basin3d, check out out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). It will help explain why, what, and how to get started.\n\n\n## Changelog\nSee the [changelog](https://basin3d.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html) for a history of updates and changes to basin3d\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Charuleka Varadharajan** - [LBL](https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/charuleka-varadharajan/)\n* **Valerie Hendrix**  - [LBL](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/uss/staff/valerie-hendrix)\n* **Danielle Svehla Christianson** - [LBL](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/uss/staff/danielle-christianson/)\n* **Catherine Wong**  - [LBL](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/uss)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nBroker for Assimilation, Synthesis and Integration of eNvironmental Diverse, Distributed Datasets (BASIN-3D) Copyright (c) 2019, The\nRegents of the University of California, through Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory (subject to receipt of any required approvals from the U.S.\nDept. of Energy).
