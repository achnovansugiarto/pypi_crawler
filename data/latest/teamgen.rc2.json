    "description": "# Tennis Team Generator\n\nThis is a pretty basic generator that takes a list of players, and generates\nteams that try and make for a fairly even distribution of player skills \non both sides of the net. It aims for the best groups.\n\nEach player is described in a a json file, and their rating includes their USTA\nrating, as well as a \"Micro NTRP\", that is an assessment, in 0.1 or 0.01 increments\nof that actual level of play, to be more precise than the NTRP. Someone has to make\na judgement there of course, usually the group captain.\n\nThe project uses a sequence of 'random' selections, and then trows out those that fail\nsome criteria. \n\nTo be frank, the algorithm isn't that great, but until I can figure out how to make a better\none, this one does the trick for me. It often requires that I run it several times, and I need\nto manually review the results. Lots of room for improvement!!\n\n## Number of Courts\nThe number of courts is configurable, so anywhere from 2-4 courts works.\n\n## Number of players\nYou need enough players to keep the courts even, so 16 for 4 courts, etc. This does not handle singles.\n\n## Distribution of Men and Women.\nGenerally, we want even numbers of men and women, but the algorithm does compensate if there are uneven\ncounts. \nFor example, if there are 4 courts, and we have 10men and 6 women, we can do 3 courts of mixed doubles,\nand one court of men's singles each round. The same applies if we have 10women and 6 men -- one court of\nwomen's singles per round.\n\n## Quality Metics\nI have some quality metrics that \"weight\" the requirement of how close the players are that play together,\n\n    I.E. Can a 4.5 play with a 3.0? That is a spread of 1.5 on one side of the court\n\nAlso, the weight of the combined rating of players across the net\n\n    If a 4.5 and 4.0 are on one side, and a 3.5 and 4.0 on the other, that is 8.5 versus 7.5, for a spread of 1.0\n\n## Maximum spread\n\nWe can limit the maximum spread on each court side so that we avoid a 4.5 playing with a 3.0, for example.\n\n\n\n",
