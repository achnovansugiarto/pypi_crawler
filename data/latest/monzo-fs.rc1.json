Follow the instructions on screen and then in your browser ..\n```\n\n**Terminal 2 (explore)**\n\n```\n$ ls /tmp/monzo\nacc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr\n\n$ ls /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/ | head\ntx_00009Aq4fq7rt647A5pWLp\ntx_00009Aq6sLNlhcLnU9MDar\ntx_00009Aq7I54SyEEcv5LaUb\ntx_00009Aq8QMKOnDp8DaZ5KD\ntx_00009Aq9nVdkRA4XqxiQV7\ntx_00009AqFGWd8Knhd5o5EDB\ntx_00009AqFXAUHugn7U6PiLZ\ntx_00009AqFxqpP7AZZH3ybb7\ntx_00009AqFxyKrCcmLc8meOH\ntx_00009AqG0e3D4pITZTntvl\n\n$ ls /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/tx_00009Aq4fq7rt647A5pWLp/\naccount_balance category        dedupe_id       json            metadata        settled\naccount_id      counterparty    description     local_amount    notes           updated\namount          created         id              local_currency  originator\nattachments     currency        is_load         merchant        scheme\n\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/tx_00009Aq4fq7rt647A5pWLp/category\nmonzo\n\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/tx_00009Aq4fq7rt647A5pWLp/amount\n100.00\n\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/tx_00009Aq4fq7rt647A5pWLp/is_load\nTrue\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou will first need to install FUSE. Mac users `brew install fuse` is an easy option, Linux users should enjoy something as simple as `apt-get install fuse` and I have no idea how this (or anything) works on Windows.\n\nOnce you have fuse installed:\n\n1. Create a [Monzo developer account](https://developers.getmonzo.co.uk/).\n2. Create a [new oauth client](https://developers.getmonzo.co.uk/apps/new) with `http://localhost:1234/` listed as a \"Redirect URL\". Note the client id and secret (you need them later).\n3. Install monzo-fs: `pip install monzo-fs`\n4. Run monzo-fs: `monzo-fs /tmp/monzo --client_id=<yours> --client_secret=<yours>`.\n5. Run through the oauth dance (click the link in terminal, put in your email, click the link in your email, go back to terminal).\n6. 🎉 You're good to go, monzo-fs is mounted on `/tmp/monzo`! 🎉\n\n## Config\n\nmonzo-fs stores state between starts in `~/.monzofs`. This file contains a valid oauth token so you don't have to constantly re-authorize everytime you restart the program.\n\n## Examples\n\nSome random examples to get you started/excited. Basically it's possible to explore your transaction history in a pretty meaningful way by looking at it as a file system. monzo-fs is designed to be relatively efficient so you don't have to be (e.g. we cache slow requests like listing transactions) but not overly agressive so data is relatively fresh (e.g. most caches live a few minutes).\n\n### Retrieve your balance\n\n```\n$ ls -l /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/balance/\ntotal 24\n-r--r--r--  0 root  wheel  6  1 Jan  1970 balance\n-r--r--r--  0 root  wheel  4  1 Jan  1970 currency\n-r--r--r--  0 root  wheel  7  1 Jan  1970 spend_today\n\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/balance/balance\n41.44\n\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/balance/spend_today\n-55.69\n```\n\n### Print the notes from a specific transaction\n\n```\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2015/08/tx_00008zIcpb1TB4yeIFXMzx/notes\nSalmon sandwich 🍞\n```\n\n### Print the number of transactions per day in a given month\n\n```\n$ cat /tmp/monzo/acc_00009Aq4VDixoGFnIxcBmr/transactions/2016/08/*/created | cut -d T -f 1 | cut -d - -f 3 | sort | uniq -c\n  17 01\n   4 02\n   4 03\n   7 04\n   4 05\n   7 06\n   5 07\n   5 08\n   1 09\n   3 10\n   3 11\n   5 12\n   7 13\n   4 14\n   1 15\n   1 16\n   6 17\n```\n\n### Print a graph of your spending over a given month\n\nThis one needs a shell script to be readable ;)\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\nfor account in \"$(ls -1 /tmp/monzo/)\"; do\n    # For each account...\n    \n    # 1) Create and truncate a file to hold date/balance pairs.\n    touch \"/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}\"\n    > \"/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}\"\n\n    # 2) Loop through all transactions in 2016/08 and get the created time and balance.\n    for txn in \"/tmp/monzo/${account}/transactions/2016/08/\"*; do\n        # Print out \"date time balance\" records.\n        created=\"$(cat \"${txn}/created\" | cut -d . -f 1)\"\n        balance=\"$(cat \"${txn}/account_balance\")\"\n        echo \"${created} ${balance}\" >> /tmp/monzo-balance-${account}\n    done \n\n    # 3) Plot as a graph using gnuplot.\n    gnuplot << __EOF\n    set terminal png\n    set output '/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}.png'\n    set xdata time\n    set format x \"%m/%d\"\n    set timefmt \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\"\n    plot \"/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}\" using 1:2 with linespoints\n__EOF\n\n    # 4) Profit?\n    rm -f \"/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}\"\n    open \"/tmp/monzo-balance-${account}.png\"\ndone\n```\n\n**Example result:**\n\n![img](http://i.imgur.com/stASKCZ.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can this spend my monzough?\n\nNot at the moment (the Monzo API is read only). If [Monzo change this](https://trello.com/c/BwKL2zRy/31-initiate-payments-via-api) and the default oauth scope provides access to initiate payments then `monzo-fs` (or tokens granted by it) could theoretically do this.\n\n### Is this safe to use?\n\nMaybe, hopefully, probably not. I use it, you should make up your own mind. It's alpha.\n\n### What permissions are files/folders given?\n\nFiles/folders have root:root as the owner (`{uid,gid} = 0`) and are world readable/listable.\n\n### How do I unmount?\n\nEasiest option is to `^C` the `monzo-fs` process. If you can't find it `pkill -f monzo-fs` might do it. Finally you can `umount -f /tmp/monzo` to kill the mount, but it's likely the `monzo-fs` process will hang around as a zombie.\n",
