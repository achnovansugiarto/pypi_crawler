    "description": "**************\r\nipdasite.theme\r\n**************\r\n\r\nThis package provides the look and feel for the the International Planetary\r\nData Alliance (IPDA_) web site, powered by Diazo_.\r\n\r\nAlthough intended for the web site of the IPDA, this package may be installed\r\non any Plone_ 4 site.  It was developed by the Planetary Data System (PDS_).\r\n\r\n.. References:\r\n.. _IPDA: http://planetarydata.org/\r\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\r\n.. _PDS: http://pds.nasa.gov/\r\n.. _Diazo: http://diazo.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\r\n\r\n* Add ``ipdasite.theme`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\r\n\r\n    [buildout]\r\n    ...\r\n    eggs =\r\n        ...\r\n        ipdasite.theme\r\n        \r\n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\r\n  \r\n    $ ./bin/buildout\r\n        \r\n\r\n.. References:\r\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\nFor more information on issues referenced below (\"IPDA-#\"), see the issue\r\ntracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/IPDA.\r\n\r\n2.1.8 — Setup\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis release removes the direct dependency on ``distribute``.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.7 — Compatibility\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis release makes the package compatible with Plone 4.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.6 — Sprites\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following:\r\n\r\n• IPDA-41 - Update agency logos\r\n\r\nIn addition, it uses the \"CSS Sprite\" technique to substantially speed up\r\ndisplay of the agency logos at the bottom of each page.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.5 — Popovers\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThis release resolves the following issue(s):\r\n\r\n• IPDA-39 - Rename action not functioning\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.4 — Passwords and Metadata\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release resolves the following issues:\r\n\r\n• IPDA-33 - Add website version on \"About\" page\r\n• IPDA-35 - Cannot reset password using emailed link\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.3 — Shifting\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following:\r\n\r\n• IPDA-31 - Add footer of the agency logos to the home page\r\n• IPDA-32 - The IPDA logo is overlapping with the blue banner\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.2 — Waldo\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n• IPDA-13 - Where's the search box?\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.1 — Increased Snazziness\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n• IPDA-2 - The IPDA logo isn't deployed\r\n• IPDA-11 - jQuery overlays not working\r\n• IPDA-12 - \"You can log in again\" form is using http, not https.  It should\r\n  be disabled/redirected.\r\n \r\n\r\n2.1.0 — Blue\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe spacey theme of the past is out.  A simple, clean blue theme is in.  And\r\nnow, we're powered by Diazo.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0.1 — Workaround TinyMCE\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release works around some of the problems with TinyMCE.  Notably, the\r\nIPDA theme includes a background image on the html element so it can fill the\r\nentire page regardless of scrolling.  However, the inner html in the TinyMCE\r\niframe picks that up as well, leaving an ugly navy blue block in your text\r\nediting area.  Secondly, Products.TinyMCE includes a link \"Edit without visual\r\neditor\" that's contained in a div with a hard-coded style block set to a -1em\r\nmargin.  That makes the link land badly in our theme.  Sadly, there's no CSS\r\nclasses or IDs we can use on that link (or its div) so we sneak some invisible\r\ncontent just above it to space it out.  (Ugly yes, but that should be fixed in\r\nProducts.TinyMCE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0.0 — Plone 4\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis release of the IPDA Site Policy brings about Plone 4 compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright & License\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCopyright 2008–2012 by the California Institute of Technology.
