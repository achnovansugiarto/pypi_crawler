    "description": "The py2pip module provides an api to get the latest package of the supported version.\n\nMaster repo: https://github.com/krmanish/py2pip\n\n\n\nMotivation\n==========\nPython Package has started dropping [Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/index.html) support.\nAnd It's quite obvious(at least happens in one of my project) that those packages are used (as part of\nrequirements.txt) without version. And when we install those package again, we experience the error like\n\n    zipp requires Python '>=3.6' but the running Python is 2.7.13  # Zip with latest release drops Py2 support\n\nTherefore, to get the right Py2.7 supported version, we used to visit the pypi site and browse all the released version\nand scan through the page to get the support version of it. This is a tedious and time consuming process.\nHence I got this idea to write a small script to get rid of that manual effort.\n\n\nPurpose\n=======\nThis helps to those who are looking for the package of the supported Py version specially the old one.\nsince the Python packages has started dropping Py2.7 support with the latest release.\n\nThis is the master package for Py2pip using Python3.\n\nIt has the following functions:\n    1. Required to pass python version and 3rd party package name\n    2. Log will work only if executed as a standalone script.\n    3. Log path dir: ~/.local/py2pip/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\nTo install py2pip, type::\n\n    pip install py2pip\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\nThis package is an help to find the package that support python2 or python2.7 but it's not limited to.\nIt's capable of to search any versions of python.\n\nAll Python dependent packages are part of py2pip dev env. Code is part of pip installable path.\nPackage is written in Python3.7 so needs System or virtual env to have these packages installed.\n1.  Python3\n2.  Python3 Devel\n3.  python3-setuptools\n4.  systemd-devel\n5.  beautifulsoup4\n6.  aiohttp\n7.  packaging\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n```\n>> import py2pip\n>> py2pip.process.Py2PIPManager('Django', '2.7').run()\n\n    Django==1.11.28\n```\n\n**Using CLI:**\n\n```\n>> python3 -m py2pip --py-version 2.7 -p mock\n\n    Execution time: 2.062346935272217\n    Supported Version: mock==3.0.5\n\n```\n\n\nLinks\n=====\nPackage home page::\n\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2pip\n\nChanges log\n===========\n\n1.0.1(Alpha)\n-----\n\n- Package Initialized with below feature\n    1. Get passed python version supported package\n    2. Log the progress report success/failure into the file\n\n  [Manish]\n\n1.0.2\n----\n- Package modification with below feature\n    1. Accept custom log path to log the message\n    2. Accept user input to enable/disable debug message\n\n  [Manish]\n\n",
