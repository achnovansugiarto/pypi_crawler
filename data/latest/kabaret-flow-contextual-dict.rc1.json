Install the package an create a new project with the type `kabaret.flow_contextual_dict.demo_flow.DemoFlow`.\n\n## Concept\n\nHere is a quick example with this classic structure where `settings` are `ContextualView` Objects:\n```\nProject\n    settings\n    episodes\n        ep001\n            settings\n            sequences\n                seq001\n                    settings\n                    shots\n                        shot001\n                            settings\n                            anim\n                                settings\n                                init_action\n                                bake_action\n                            lighting\n                                settings\n                                init_action\n                                render_action\n                            comp\n                                settings\n                                init_action\n                                render_action\n                        shot002\n                seq002\n                    ...\n        ep002\n            ...\n```\nLet's say in the `Project.settings` defines `fps=24` and a `pool=\"ANY\"`.\nEvery object in the episodes branch can call `get_contextual_dict()` to receive a dict like `{fps:24, pool:\"ANY\"}`.\nMost likely, action of every step/department of every shot will use this.\n\nNow let's say the sequence `seq002` is in a hurry and you want to dispatch all actions on your farm's \"SUPER_COMPUTERS\" pool. All you need is to \"override\" with `pool=\"SUPER_COMPUTERS\"` in `ep002.settings`.\n\nYou can do this in each `settings` in the flow, and you can also \"add\" values in each of them (those \"overrides\" and \"adds\" are called \"edits\").\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a cascading dict, or as some call it: a **contextual dict**.\n\n## Install\n\n`pip install kabaret.flow_contextual_dict`\n\nPlease use a virtual env, it is good for you and your karma ^^\n\n## Usage\n\n### Defining Contexts\n\nIn order to add a contextual dict in your flow, you just need to add\na Child relation to a `ContextualView`:\n```\nclass Shot(flow.Object):\n\n    settings = flow.Child(contextualView)\n    ...\n\n```\n\nThe name of the relation is very important:\n- Overrides stacking is based on this name so you need to use the same\nname along your branch in order for overrides to work as expected.\n- It defines the \"context_name\" argument to use for `get_contextual_dict()` calls.\n\nSo this will not work:\n```\nProject\n    settings\n    episodes\n        ep001\n            episode_settings\n```\nBut this will:\n```\nProject \n    settings\n    episodes\n        ep001\n            settings\n```\nNote that you can use `Child().ui(label=\"Episode Settings\")` if you *really* want to display a different name in the GUI.\n\nThis gives the ability to use several contexts in the same flow.\nIn this structure, all * marked item are `ContextualView`. There is two\ncontext defined: `settings` and `config`. The first one drives values by `sequences` and `shots`, the second one only affects `episodes`.\n```\nProject\n    settings *\n    config *\n    episodes\n        ep001\n        config *\n        sequences\n            seq001\n                settings *\n                shots\n                    shot001\n                        settings *\n```\n\n### Editing Context Values\n\nOnce your flow is salted with `ContextualView`, the user will be able to\nadd value using the *\"Add\"* action and to edit values by double clicking on them.\n\nIf you want, for debug or inquiry, you can inspect the edits done thru a `ContectualView` by using its \"Show Edits\" actions. It will bring you to\na page showing only values defined here. Double-clicking one of those items\nwill show you more information, especially **the history of modification** for this value (what changed, who did it, and when).\nYou will also be able to change the override value, as well as disable/enable it.\n\nYou can also programatically edit the context by defining `get_default_contextual_edits(context_name)` methods returning a dict of value to use if no override exists for them.\n\nIn other words: user edits made with `ContextualView` actions will override values returned by a local or upstream `get_default_contextual_edits()` method.\n\n### Using Context Values\n\nIn order to get a context dict, you just need to call `get_contextual_dict(leaf, context_name)`. The `leaf` is the point in the branch where you want the value to be evaluated. It will most of the time be `self`. \n\nHere is an example in an Action.run():\n```\nclass SubmitRender(flow.Action):\n\n    render_settings = flow.Child(ContextualView)\n\n    def run(self, button):\n        if button == 'Confirm':\n            context = get_contextual_dict(\n                self, 'render_settings'\n            )\n            my_dispatcher.submit(\n                scene=self.get_scene_path(),\n                fps=context.get('fps', 24),\n                pool=context.get('pool', 'ANY'),\n            )\n```\nNote that the second arg of the `get_contextual_dict()` call must match\nthe name of each `ContextualView` to evaluate in the upstream branch.\n\nAlso note that using a `ContextualView` as the Action Child has drawbacks in term of UX. We're waiting for a update of `kabaret` to fix this.\n\n### Default Value\n\nAt the base of your context, you will probably want to have a set of default values.\n\nYou will do this by adding a 'get_default_contextual_edits()` method returning the default value.\n\nLet's say your `Project` is the first level for you settings. You would\ndo something like:\n```\nclass Project(flow.Object):\n\n    settings = flow.Child(ContextualView)\n    episodes = flow.Child(Episodes)\n\n    def get_default_contextual_edits(self, context_name):\n        if context_name == 'settings':\n            return dict(\n                fps=30,\n                pool=\"ANY\"\n            )\n```\n\n## Special Case\n\nSometimes, you will want to put the visualisation/edition of the contextual values aside from the branch it affect.\n\nAn example would be the settings of a project. They affect the **WHOLE UNIVERSE** so maybe you wouldn't want them to show on the first page all users land to...\n\nA classic aproach is to use an `admin` group and shove all geeky stuff in it:\n```\nProject\n    word_of_the_day\n    episodes\n        ...\n    admin\n        settings\n        config\n        preferences\n```\n\nIn this case, the `settings` object is not inside the `episodes` branch so it does not affect it. This is a fail at being usefull :/\n\nTo fix this, you can define inside `Project` a `get_contextual_view` method that returns a `ContextView` to consider as if it was its Child:\n```\nclass Project(flow.Object):\n    \n    word_of_the_day = flow.Chid(WOTD)\n    episodes = flow.Child(Episodes)\n    admin = flow.Child(ProjectAdmin)\n\n    def get_contextual_view(self, context_name):\n        if context_name == 'settings':\n            return self.admin.settings\n        elif context_name == 'config'\n            return self.admin.config\n\n    def get_default_contextual_edits(self, context_name):\n        if context_name == 'settings':\n            return dict(\n                fps=30,\n                pool=\"ANY\"\n            )\n```\n\n**Note** that the default value must still be provided by the `Project` class !",
