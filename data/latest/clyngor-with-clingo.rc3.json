    "description": "# Clyngor with clingo\nThis is a python package installing a clingo binary along the [clyngor package](https://github.com/aluriak/clyngor),\nso the end-user will not have to care about the clingo installation.\n\nThe clingo binary is taken for Linux, OSX and Windows on [the official release page](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/)\n\n# Installation\nWhen someone (who doesn't understand \"install clingo binary in your path\") have to install clyngor, give them that line instead:\n\n    pip install clyngor-with-clingo\n\nA clingo executable will appear in their `bin`. May need root access if the said someone is working at system level.\n\n\n## Maintenance\nThe package must be updated to use new clingo binaries.\n\n- Script `retrieve-clingo.sh <clingo version>` will automatically retrieve the given clingo version.\n- Script `put-clingo-version.sh <clingo version>` will automatically push the given clingo version into the package.\n\nUse [zest.releaser](https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io) to upload new versions ; be careful to **match clingo version with package version**.\n\n\n\n# How to perform this magic\n\n## The current solution: faking clingo as a python script\n[Link to the way of doing that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24686838/distributing-a-binary-utility-in-setuptools). Thanks !\n\nI end up [reproducing the same entry point implementation, using pkg_resource](clyngor_with_clingo/__init__.py), and it works:\nbinaries are embedded in the package using the [MANIFEST.in](MANIFEST.in), and the package only real operation\nis to delegate command line arguments to the proper clingo binary.\n\nThis seems to work, but:\n\n- user has not control over the installed binary (however that package is all about having the user to not have to cope with that, but stillâ€¦ Experienced users should never use it)\n- the 3 binaries are sent to the user, and the choice is made at execution time.\n\n\n## The on-the-fly solution: hack upon setuptools to download binary at installation\nMethod used by [pyasp](https://github.com/sthiele/pyasp/blob/master/setup.py#L136).\n\nHas a lot of drawbacks, such as binary downloading from the client side, and necessity to use `--no-cache-dir` pip flag to force pip to execute the hack.\n\n\n## The proper but non-working solution: embed a platform-specific binary into a python package\nThe python part of the package is simplistic (well, there could be **no** python in this package),\nbe [we still need a basic architecture](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12461603/setting-up-setup-py-for-packaging-of-a-single-py-file-and-a-single-data-file-wi).\n\n\n### platform-specific magic\nSetuptools provides since [PEP 508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508) the environment markers,\ntheoretically [usable in setup.cfg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44878440/correct-use-of-pep-508-environment-markers-in-setup-cfg)\nwith [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/1520):\n\n    [options.data_files]\n    bin/clingo =\n        bin/linux/clingo; platform_system==\"Linux\"\n        bin/macos/clingo; platform_system==\"Darwin\"\n        bin/win/clingo.exe; platform_system==\"Windows\"\n\nBut it does not works. [A question has been asked about it](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1728), also [on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56004271/3077939).\n\nProbably it's because data_files does not support environment markers. Hence this solution has been abandonned.",
