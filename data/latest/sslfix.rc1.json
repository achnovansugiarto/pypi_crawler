    "description": "**This is a fixed version of ssl-1.15. It's a drop-in replacement for 'ssl' package.**\n\nThe fixes are:\n - Remove installing tests system-wide (fixes \"permission denied\" error when installing into virtualenv).\n - Add /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu to search path (fixes compilation on ubuntu 12.04).\n - Do not use SSLv2_method if not present (fixes ImportError: ssl/_ssl2.so: undefined symbol: SSLv2_method).\n\nSee https://github.com/denik/sslfix\n\n-------\n\nThe old socket.ssl() support for TLS over sockets is being\nsuperseded in Python 2.6 by a new 'ssl' module.  This package\nbrings that module to older Python releases, 2.3.5 and up (it may\nalso work on older versions of 2.3, but we haven't tried it).\n\nIt's quite similar to the 2.6 ssl module.  There's no stand-alone\ndocumentation for this package; instead, just use the development\nbranch documentation for the SSL module at\nhttp://docs.python.org/dev/library/ssl.html.\n\nVersion 1.0 had a problem with Python 2.5.1 -- the structure of\nthe socket object changed from earlier versions.\n\nVersion 1.1 was missing various package metadata information.\n\nVersion 1.2 added more package metadata, and support for\nssl.get_server_certificate(), and the PEM-to-DER encode/decode\nroutines.  Plus integrated Paul Moore's patch to setup.py for\nWindows.  Plus added support for asyncore, and asyncore HTTPS\nserver test.\n\nVersion 1.3 fixed a bug in the test suite.\n\nVersion 1.4 incorporated use of -static switch.\n\nVersion 1.5 fixed bug in Python version check affecting build on\nPython 2.5.0.\n\nVersion 1.7 (and 1.6) fixed some bugs with asyncore support (recv and\nsend not being called on the SSLSocket class, wrong semantics for\nsendall).\n\nVersion 1.8 incorporated some code from Chris Stawarz to handle\nsockets which are set to non-blocking before negotiating the SSL\nsession.\n\nVersion 1.9 makes ssl.SSLError a subtype of socket.error.\n\nVersion 1.10 fixes a bug in sendall().\n\nVersion 1.11 includes the MANIFEST file, and by default will turne\nunexpected EOFs occurring during a read into a regular EOF.  It also\nremoves the code for SSLFileStream, to use the regular socket module's\n_fileobject instead.\n\nVersion 1.12 fixes the bug in SSLSocket.accept() reported by Georg\nBrandl, and adds a test case for that fix.\n\nVersion 1.13 fixes a bug in calling do_handshake() automatically\non non-blocking sockets.  Thanks to Giampaolo Rodola.  Now includes\nreal asyncore test case.\n\nVersion 1.14 incorporates some fixes to naming (rename \"recv_from\" to\n\"recvfrom\" and \"send_to\" to \"sendto\"), and a fix to the asyncore test\ncase to unregister the connection handler when the connection is\nclosed.  It also exposes the SSL shutdown via the \"unwrap\" method\non an SSLSocket.  It exposes \"subjectPublicKey\" in the data received\nfrom a peer cert.\n\nVersion 1.15 fixes a bug in write retries, where the output buffer has\nchanged location because of garbage collection during the interim.\nIt also provides the new flag, PROTOCOL_NOSSLv2, which selects SSL23,\nbut disallows actual use of SSL2.\n\nAuthorship: A cast of dozens over the years have written the Python\nSSL support, including Marc-Alan Lemburg, Robin Dunn, GvR, Kalle\nSvensson, Skip Montanaro, Mark Hammond, Martin von Loewis, Jeremy\nHylton, Andrew Kuchling, Georg Brandl, Bill Janssen, Chris Stawarz,\nNeal Norwitz, and many others.  Thanks to Paul Moore, David Bolen and\nMark Hammond for help with the Windows side of the house.  And it's\nall based on OpenSSL, which has its own cast of dozens!",
