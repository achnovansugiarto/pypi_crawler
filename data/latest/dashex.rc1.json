Wouldn't\nyou like to store your monitoring configurations in a single place?  Wouldn't\nyou like to use \"infra as code\" to get versionning, leave an audit trail,\nback-up your configurations, etc.?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, this tool is for you!\n\nIn short, ``dashex`` is a command-line tool that allows you to:\n\n1. save/export your monitoring configuration to disk in a normalized format;\n2. load/import your monitoring configuration from disk to your monitoring\n   infrastructure.\n\nThe storage on disk is a text-based format designed to be \"easily\" diffeable,\nallowing you to review/audit changes.  You can store this in Git to submit\nmonitoring configuration changes as pull requests, have your peers review your\nchanges, deploy them as post-commit hooks, etc.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThis project uses permissive licensing.  Nobody is paid to support/maintain\nthis software.  You may request support in the issue tracker, but be prepared\nto submit a pull request to fix bugs and/or submit improvements.",
