    "description": "Plone hotfix, 2017-01-17\n========================\n\nThis hotfix fixes several security issues:\n\n- A reflected Cross Site Scripting attack (XSS) in the ZMI (``manage_findResult``).\n  You may already be blocking access to ``manage`` pages in a web server like ``nginx`` or ``Apache``.\n  In that case, this part of the hotfix is fine, but is not relevant.\n\n- Accessing private content via ``str.format`` in through-the-web templates and scripts.\n  See this `blog post by Armin Ronacher <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/>`_ for the general idea.\n  Since the ``format`` method was introduced in Python 2.6, this part of the hotfix is only relevant for Plone 4 and 5, not Plone 3.\n\n\nCompatibility\n=============\n\nThis hotfix should be applied to the following versions of Plone:\n\n* Plone 5.0.6 and any earlier 5.x version\n* Plone 4.3.11 and any earlier 4.x version\n* Any older version of Plone\n\nThe hotfix is officially supported by the Plone security team on the\nfollowing versions of Plone in accordance with the Plone\n`version support policy`_: 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.7, 4.3.11 and 5.0.6.\nHowever it has also received some testing on older versions of Plone.\nThe fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,\nso Plone 4.3.12, 5.0.7 and greater should not require this hotfix.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstallation instructions can be found at\nhttps://plone.org/security/hotfix/20170117\n\n\nAutomated testing\n=================\n\nIf you have automated tests for your code and you want to run them in combination with this hotfix, to see if there any regressions, you should make sure the hotfix is included in your test setup.\nWith plone.app.testing it should look something like this in your test layer fixture::\n\n\n    def setUpZope(self, app, configurationContext):\n        from plone.testing import z2\n        z2.installProduct(app, 'Products.PloneHotfix20170117')\n\nWith the old-style Products.PloneTestCase it should be like this::\n\n    from Testing import ZopeTestCase\n    ZopeTestCase.installProduct('PloneHotfix20170117', quiet=1)\n\n\nQ&A\n===\n\nQ: How can I confirm that the hotfix is installed correctly and my site is protected?\n  A: On startup, the hotfix will log a number of messages to the Zope event log\n  that look like this::\n\n      2017-01-17 08:42:11 INFO Products.PloneHotfix20170117 Applied zmi patch\n      2017-01-17 08:42:11 INFO Products.PloneHotfix20170117 Hotfix installed\n\n  The exact number of patches applied, will differ depending on what packages you are using.\n  If a patch is attempted but fails, it will be logged as a warning that says\n  \"Could not apply\". This may indicate that you have a non-standard Plone\n  installation.\n\nQ: How can I report problems installing the patch?\n  A: Contact the Plone security team at security@plone.org, or visit the\n  #plone channel on freenode IRC.\n\nQ: How can I report other potential security vulnerabilities?\n  A: Please email the security team at security@plone.org rather than discussing\n  potential security issues publicly.\n\n.. _`version support policy`: http://plone.org/support/version-support-policy\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0 (2017-01-17)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release",
