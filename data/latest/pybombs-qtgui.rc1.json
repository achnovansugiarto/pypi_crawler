    "description": "PyBOMBS - QtGUI\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPyBOMBS (the Python Bundles Overlay Managed Build System) is a meta-package\nmanager that can install packages from source or using the local package\nmanager(s).\n\nIt was mainly designed for use by users of the `GNU Radio project`_, which\nis extended by a large number of out-of-tree modules (OOTs).\n\nPyBOMBS is a recipe-based system and can easily mix and match installations\nfrom different sources. Cross-compilation works transparently.\n\nPyBOMBS QtGUI is Qt based GUI frontend for the PyBOMBS package. It is developed\nas a part of the Google Summer of Code 2016.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nWith PyBOMBS installed, you might want to install GNU Radio and other OOT Modules\ninto a directory called 'my_prefix'. PyBOMBS-QtGUI extends the PYBOMBS command\nline interface and provides a neat GUI to easily install GNU Radio and related\nprojects.\n\nPyBOMBS/PYBOMBS-QtGUI will determine the dependency tree for GNU Radio, and\ninstall dependencies either through the local system's package manager (e.g.\napt-get, yum, pip...) or pull the source files and build them in the\nprefix.\n\nFor more informations see the `documentation`_.\n\n.. _GNU Radio project: http://gnuradio.org/\n.. _documentation: http://gnuradio.org/pybombs/",
