    "description": "Nutritracker\n------------\n\nAn extensible nutrient tracking app designed for home and office use.\nCLI backend.\n\n*Requires:*\n\n- Python 3.6.5 or later\n- Desktop (Win/mac/Linux)\n- *(Optional)* Android 5.0+ phone, USB, adb, developer mode\n\nDownloading Food Data\n=====================\nCan be downloaded manually, visit these links: \n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/\n\nhttps://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search (see downloads, ASCII not Access)\n\nThese can also be downloaded from the Android app, or synced over USB cable, with the exception of the Branded foods database.  This can also be loaded onto phones by force, but it will slow the app down at start-time since it contains over 300 thousand foods with full ingredient lists.\n\nAvailable resources\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nInstalling from Release\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nThe PyPi release, which can be installed on Python >3.6.5 with :code:`pip install nutri`, ships by default with:\n\n1) The USDAstock database,\n2) Supplementary flavonoid database, and\n3) Extra fields (IF, ORAC, GI).\n\nNo configuration is required in the release, but when adding your own or doing the process from scratch you will need to pair column names with known nutrient names in a \"config.txt\".\n\nThe full database import process is explained with :code:`nutri db --help`\n\nDownloading Resources\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nYou can download resources from mac/Linux terminal.\n\n`Curl for Windows <https://curl.haxx.se/windows/>`_ requires it be put in the $PATH variable.  Better directions for getting set up on Windows will be (eventually) posted `on youtube <https://www.youtube.com/user/gamesguru>`_.\n\nSo Windows users can simply download with a web browser:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/\n\n**Databases**\n\n- Standard USDA database, 8790 foods\n\n    `curl -L https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/USDAstock.txt -o USDAstock.txt`\n\n- Branded Foods Database. **LARGE 100MB+! PC ONLY**\n    \n    `curl -L https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/BFPDB/BFPD_csv_07132018.zip -o BFPD_csv_07132018.zip`\n\n**Supplementary USDA Extensions**\n\n- Flavonoid, Isoflavonoids, and Proanthocyanidins\n    \n    `curl -L https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/USDA_ext_rel.zip -o USDA_ext_rel.zip`\n\n**Extra Fields**\n\n**Note:** We are trying to start a collection of fields and make our models more general. Please upload and get in touch at `gitter.im/nutritracker/nutri <https://gitter.im/nutritracker/nutri>`_  ... (these can consist in magazine cutouts, obscure articles, or other sources of nutrient data)\n\n- `IF <https://inflammationfactor.com/if-rating-system/>`_, `ORAC <https://www.superfoodly.com/orac-values/>`_, GI, Omega-3, and (anti-nutrient?) oxalic acid\n\n    `curl -L  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/Extra_fields.zip -o Extra_fields.zip`\n\n\nGetting Set Up\n==============\nYou need to make a user first, then import DBs with  :code:`nutri db --help`.  After that you can pair fields and add custom foods.  Or just use the stock database to start making recipes and tracking simple meals.\n\nEventually you can track more fields and metrics on a daily basis, include more on your log, get to know your habits, and benefit from automated suggestions.\n\nDue to the localized nature of the program (i.e. it runs for your computer, on your computer) we are able to outperform some websites in searches.  We can update your search results AS YOU TYPE.  But for the same reason we also face limitations, such as not having a very large Barcode database, or community-driven input.  Mostly we add data to the stock set when someone submits an interesting sample, perhaps only 30 foods.\n\nGenerating Log Reports\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWith the :code:`log` function, you can get detailed information printed in porcelain, color, or chart form (percentages, macros, extendeds, lowest/highest score).  It's possible to filter by date range or nutrient type.  Eventually we will make a seperate analysis command, to analyse any ingredient, food, or recipe across the standard metrics.\n\nThe Android app may be more intuitive for people less familiar with computers, it offers many of the same features and we are constantly working to improve that.\n\nEventually someone can make a GUI interface for the computer that parses the porcelain output, and that may be easier to use.\n\nUsage\n^^^^^\n\nRun the :code:`nutri` script to output usage.\n\nUsage: :code:`nutri <command>`\n\n**Commands**\n::\n\n    user                    create, edit and switch users\n    \n    db                      import, edit and verify databases\n    \n    field                   import, pair and manage fields\n    \n    recipe                  create, edit and view foods and recipes\n    \n    search                  search databases or recipes\n    \n    add                     add foods or items to daily log\n    \n    log                     show previous meals and summary\n    \n    sync                    sync android device\n    \n    contrib                 rank contribution\n    \n    --help | -h             show help for a given command",
