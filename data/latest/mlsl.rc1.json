    "description": "# MlSL: Machine learning Student's Library\n_Technically_ pronounced \"mill-sill\"; conveniently pronounced \"[^missile]\".\n\n## Ethos\nThis library is meant to to make machine learning _as understandable as\nhumanly possible_; to whiten the black boxes, to make the code as good to read\nas the documentation. Where it can, it holds your hand. And if it's saying too\nmuch, you can tell it to shut up.\n\nIf there's somewhere it fails to achieve this goal, please open a\nGitHub [issue](https://github.com/jad-b/mlsl/issues).\n\nAs such, it _should_ be out-performed by any of the \"serious\" ML packages:\nTheano, Autograd, TensorFlow, etc. If not, well, something's either wrong on\ntheir end, or I need to publish.\n\n\n[^missile]:\n    https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=+define+missile",
