See [Safety considerations for online generative modelling](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BMfNu82iunjqKyQA9/safety-considerations-for-online-generative-modeling#Safety_advantages_of_generative_modeling), [Soft optimization makes the value target bigger](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9fL22eBJMtyCLvL7j/soft-optimization-makes-the-value-target-bigger#Fine_tuned_generative_models), [RLHF bad, conditioning good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AXpXG9oTiucidnqPK/take-13-rlhf-bad-conditioning-good)\n\n\nThis library helps you investigate decision transformers empirically by:\n1. Providing a compatible tokenizer - what we'll call a DecisionTokenizer. Among other things, it reduces `model_max_length` by 1 so that we can reserve the first token for the reward token.  \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nfrom conditionme import create_decision_tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ndecision_tokenizer = create_decision_tokenizer(tokenizer)\n```\n2. Providing a compatible model that takes into your scalar `target_rewards`. Currently, we only support gpt2. The DecisionGPT2LMHeadModel takes in `target_rewards` as an additional argument to the forward method. It will automatically offset / modify provided attention_masks, position_ids and labels to account for the reward token. \n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel\nfrom conditionme import DecisionGPT2LMHeadModel\n\nloaded_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ndecision_model = DecisionGPT2LMHeadModel.from_loaded_pretrained_model(loaded_model)\n```\n\n## Toy example - Imdb sentiment analysis\nUsing gpt-large as our pretrained model, we finetune our model to match our target reward.\nRun it in colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qu1T8zFd3GouaSoG0ABe9kq87nGWCyWJ?usp=sharing)\nView the training script [here](examples/imdb/train_imdb.py).\n\n```bash\ngit clone git+https://github.com/thejaminator/conditionme.git#egg=conditionme\ncd conditionme\n# make a virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\nexport PYTHONPATH=.; python examples/imdb/train_imdb.py --batch-size 1 --epochs 1 --model gpt2 --save-dir gpt2_conditional\n```\n\n| ![high_reward_dist.png](eval_results%2Flarge_results%2Fhigh_reward_dist.png) | ![low_reward_dist.png](eval_results%2Flarge_results%2Flow_reward_dist.png) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Actual reward obtained by setting the target reward to 1.0                    | Actual reward obtained by setting the target reward to 0.0                 |\n\nWe observe that we can obtain either very bad or very good movie reviews, controlled by the target reward we set.\n\nSee full csv of results [here](eval_results/large_results)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See 20 examples of maximum target reward</summary>\n\n| prompt                    | completion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | actual_reward |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n| I love sci-fi             | for its' style, and to see people like Spielberg take risks with it, is almost unwatchable if you are not in a sci-fi phase! Spielberg is always at his best in his films. He's great in the sci-fi movies that he does not direct, and this one may be my favorite. Most of the other films mentioned, with the exception of \"Aliens\", do not have a Spielberg look at them, they are either Hollywood, Hollywood films or just plain mediocre                                    | 0.63          |\n| Worth the entertainment   | . I couldn't help falling in love with Ms. Price. She has beautiful facial, but no more of it, because her face shows too much. She is very strong - she is the reason to watch this movie! It is easy to understand her as a very young woman trying to come to the conclusion that she has to get control of her life (as she puts it). Her emotions at times are very hard to see (as she was not expecting this at all!).

And this is not the case. It focuses on a man named Richard who has never met his own wife (his last known living girlfriend after a divorce). He is actually going through a divorce from his fiancé, and is still paying alimony to his fiancé, and the marriage is just going down hill with his ex-girlfriend (she                                         | 0.94          |\n| First off let             | me say I'm not some prude who hates every type of film. I love great movies. They are wonderful to see, make you laugh and feel for the characters and even admire. With great movies like this one you have to wonder - if this movie truly is such a bad movie. The problem is most movies that seem to be good are still great because they have great actors and story telling. The problem is that this movie doesn't have either of those types of actors and story telling. | 0.91          |\n| I had high                | hopes when I rented this one and it didn't disappoint at all.<br /><br />It was extremely well casted and I found it a surprisingly good film. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes action films. That said, it's an OK action film although, given the budget, it wasn't all that spectacular. It isn't bad, really good, but it wasn't great, I was satisfied and I don't think it deserved much more praise.<br /><br                                                | 0.98          |\n| Isaac Florentine has      | always been a fan of both Giallo's and his own genre, so it was great to hear about this movie and to see him backlit with such a wonderful cast. Now that I'm aware of other people's opinions about the movie I cannot resist including this review. The movie is very much about a poor man's murder film.<br /><br />The first time I saw it was on FX last night and I'm now watching it again now.

This makes me a kind of the same as a critic of \"The Ring\".<br /><br />This movie is nothing more than an endless collection, but that is the only way it tells it's story. In fact, that story can be summed up in something very clever, because this is one of the most brilliant movies that I have seen in quite some time.                               | 0.91          |\n| Honestly awful film,      | \" \" \"===I am a young woman.<br /><br />After years, an old lady meets her final victim in a mysterious room.

Perhaps some of you have seen some horror movies          | 0.01          |\n| This flick is             | one of my all time favorites. At a time when there were simply more popular movies out there in America than anything else, this movie shows all of the potential of such a great movie.

This movie just blows away the pretensions of Bakersfield, they are so close to my life (and the beauty of the city) that I felt I had to pay it a lot of respect.<br /><br />What I love about this film is that you don't know what is going on and never know if                                             | 0.99          |\n| This cheap, grainy-filmed | , low-budget sci-fi has only one redeeming feature: Its actors are, so far, remarkably untalented. Only the cast's most seasoned professional actor, William Powell, seems to have made any real effort at all to gain his chops and make this movie worth watching. In a way, though, it's kind of wonderful to see a guy who actually made a film on the cheap, where he can enjoy the process of film-making in all its guile and chaos.                                        | 0.06          |\n| I just finished           | viewing \"The Big Chill\" for the eighth time since I first saw it, a week into the month!

It's also a little bit over done for the time period, and the music (or lack-thereof) is overdone.

However there are a few silly things in the script that make it hard to watch (I'm saying that as an obsessive B-film fan).

However, upon seeing it, I found myself laughing, I cried and so in spirit that I have no desire to re-watch this film. <br /><br />Firstly, why? because it stars a woman dressed up as her own alter ego in the story - it was                                                | 0.67          |\n| I saw the                 | film at the Venice Film Festival and was not impressed. It is obviously based on a work of Russian novelist Lev Solodovsky. If that is the inspiration you are looking for, the movie is not up to the task. Solodovsky did not manage to complete the novel in all its entirety, so his work does not lend itself this way. This is a disappointment. Solodovsky's novel includes no sex: neither erotic, nor asexual nor lesbian; one need not enjoy the novel's                   | 0.01          |\n| A group of                | friends and neighbors are terrorized in an abandoned amusement park by the psychotic Robert \"the King Kid\" Pyle. He uses a shotgun to shoot down the helpless victims. The police aren't called off till he has been apprehended and they call in an unlikely lead actress as \"the Lady of Justice,\" who has escaped the clutches of an evil sheriff and set out to take revenge on Pyle and his band of murderous bullies.<br /><br />The \"Lady of Justice\" plot idea seems         | 0.05          |\n| Now, I LOVE               | that movie and I love that movie, but why bother watching this film which is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen? This is one of the first films that I have ever laughed at seriously, and I'm only 21. I love all the kids from my youth who have since gone on to so-called fame (Burt Reynolds, Ben Stiller, Jason Evers), and I love that they are now trying to market themselves (Burt Riedels, Ben Stiller                                                     | 0.33          |\n| This cheap, grainy-filmed | movie was made on film stock that I suppose was more plastic than real. It's not even nearly as scary as those cheap monster movies that make huge use of CGI - those that make use of special effects and a plot that can't have been written by an eleven-year-old. I have seen worse monster movies, and I've seen some far worse action pictures, but the makers of this one can't even produce a good action movie. The makers of the \"Ride with the Deadly                     | 0             |\n| I just finished           | watching the new remake of \"Muppet Babies\"--I can't believe that a movie, with so many potential stars, is trashed by such a film snobbishly dubbed. I saw the original movies before it was dubbed--it had the charm and power of the original. Granted, the movie was made in 1946 when they had their \"Muppets\" for the first time, but this movie was just so badly translated that the whole film loses its purpose without the benefit of                                      | 0             |\n| Ben, (Rupert Grint),      | a college student whose life is not quite what it seems, goes out with his friends to New York City to get laid for himself so he can pursue his dreams of becoming a super hero in the future. Upon arriving, he gets an idea to start his own superhero costume.<br /><br />In the beginning the film is not very good. There are a few cheap shots of people in the streets and a couple of clips where the hero is in action. I have not seen this movie for                     | 0.02          |\n| Every movie I             | have ever seen has disappointed me with this being what makes the movie,but with an excellent cast like Chris Smith(who also directed),and a decent script(this movie had a good story line and I believe the best and most funny part is when Chris finds himself in LA telling tales of his time in L.A.), this movie might not be the greatest movie I have seen but it is the best. If you can see the past of the movie,it is an action/comedy.                                 | 0.99          |\n\n</details>\n\nNote: if you try to plot a correlation plot between the target reward and the actual reward, it may look like it doesn't work well between the range of target reward (0.1, 0.9) . This is probably because the training dataset is heavily skewed towards 0.0 or 1.0 rewards.\n<details>\n  <summary>See correlation plot</summary>\n\n![correlation.png](eval_results%2Flarge_results%2Fcorrelation.png)\n</details>\n\n\n\n## How does it work?\nWe can't take the [decision transformer implementation](https://huggingface.co/blog/decision-transformers) and just make our existing language model work with the decision transformer architecture. \nThere's a few simplifications that we need to make it work.\n1. Instead of multiple (reward-to-go, state, action) in an rollout/episode, we only have one single reward per episode. \n2. Rather than having separate state and action heads, we'll continue using the same language model head. \nSo it becomes (reward-to-go, text completion) instead.\n3. We'll just use whatever existing positional encoding from the existing language model.\n\nWhat we do is:\n1. We reserve the first token to encode the scalar target reward.\n2. We learn a linear layer to map the scalar reward to a vector of the same size as the hidden state of the first token. This is a the same thing that happens in the decision transformer implementation.\n3. We'll offset / modify our attention masks, position_ids, and labels to account for this.\n3. We finetune our model autoregressively, just that we'll specify the target reward along with our inputs.\n\nThis is the value add of the library, we should handle all this for you.\n\n## Alternative means of conditioning RL\nAs an alternative to this library, you can literally encode the reward as text input.\n\nInstead of using scalar rewards, you can have discrete rewards, and [encode them as tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08582).\n\nYou also can try and encode the reward literally as text that contains the numbers of the reward.\n[I demonstrate it here](https://github.com/thejaminator/prompt_reward_rl/blob/main/documentation/main_page.md#ability-to-match-a-single-reward)\nA downside of this is that you'll probably be more open to prompt injection.  And you'll need to be more careful with how your rewards can get tokenized into multiple different tokens.\nYou'll also won't have a linear layer on top of that reward's token's hidden state, which the decision transformer does add.\n\n\n## TODO list\n- [x] Validate that it works on a toy example\n- [x] Reach out to others and ask if the hack makes sense\n- [x] Add support for huggingface pretrained models saving\n- [x] Add collab notebook for toy example\n- [ ] Add more tests for tokenization and the position/attention/label modifications\n- [ ] Add examples for RLHF tasks - e.g. Openai's summarization where an [existing reward model is somewhat available](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant)\n- [ ] Add support for some other pretrained models - not just gpt2\n- [ ] Write docs on how to add support for arbitrary pretrained models that are not added yet.\n- [ ] Settings for prompt vs completion token loss\n- [ ] Add support for online training\n\n",
