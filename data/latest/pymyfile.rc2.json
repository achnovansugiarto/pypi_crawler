    "description": "# PyMyFile\n\nPyMyFile is a python library for advance file handeling in the easiest possible way\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install pymyfile\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nConsider a file \"sample.txt\" with following content\n\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n### First import the library and initiate the file object\n```python\nimport pymyfile\nmyfile = pymyfile.file(\"sample.txt\")\n```\n### Then calling the functions will make the desired changes to the file, here's a berief explaination to each.\n\n#### read()\nThis will return the content of the file, you don't need to close().\n\n#### readline(line_num)\nThis will return the specified\n```python\n>>> content = myfile.readline(line_num = 3)\n>>> print(content)\nThis is third line of the file.\n```\n\n#### readlines(from_line_num, to_line_num)\nThis will return line in range from_line_num to _to_line_num. This will include both ends.\n```python\n>>> contents = myfile.readlines(from_line_num = 2, to_line_num = 5))\n>>> print(content)\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\n```\n\n#### append(data)\nThis will append data to the file, you don't need to close().\n```python\n>>> myfile.append(data = \"This is appended line.\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\nThis is appended line.\n```\n\n#### append_line(line_num,data)\nThis will append data to that line\n```python\n>>> myfile.append_line(line_num = 5, data = \" This is appended data to line.\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file. This is appended data to line.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### write(data)\nThis will write to the file\n```python\n>>> myfile.write(\"This is some data.\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is some data.\n```\n\n#### write_line(line_num,data)\nThis will write that particular line of the file.\n```python\n>>> myfile.write_line(line_num = 2, data = \"This is new content of the line.\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is new content of the line.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### replace_word(line_num, old_word, new_word, occurence=ALL, from_word_num=None, to_word_num=None)\nThis will replace that particular word from that particular line\n```python\n>>> myfile.replace_word(line_num = 1, old_word = \"file\", new_word = \"some word\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\n1. This is first line of the some word.\n2. This is second line of the file.\n3. This is third line of the file.\n4. This is fourth line of the file.\n5. This is fifth line of the file.\n6. This is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nn. This is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n#### numiphy()\nThis will add numbers at the begining of each line\n```python\n>>> myfile.numiphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\n1. This is first line of the file.\n2. This is second line of the file.\n3. This is third line of the file.\n4. This is fourth line of the file.\n5. This is fifth line of the file.\n6. This is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nn. This is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### denumiphy()\nThis will revert the changes caused by numiphy()\n```python\n>>> myfile.numiphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### bulletiphy()\nThis will add bullets \"•\" at the begining of each line.\n```python\n>>> myfile.bulletiphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\n• This is first line of the file.\n• This is second line of the file.\n• This is third line of the file.\n• This is fourth line of the file.\n• This is fifth line of the file.\n• This is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n• This is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### debulletiphy()\nThis will revert the changes caused by bulletiphy().\n```python\n>>> myfile.debulletiphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### asteriphy()\nThis is same as bulletiphy() but this will add \"*\" instead of bullet.\n```python\n>>> myfile.asteriphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\n* This is first line of the file.\n* This is second line of the file.\n* This is third line of the file.\n* This is fourth line of the file.\n* This is fifth line of the file.\n* This is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n* This is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### deasteriphy()\nThis will revert the changes caused by asteriphy().\n```python\n>>> myfile.deasteriphy()\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n\n#### phy(phy)\nThis is same as asteriphy() or bulletiphy() but add the custom phy instead.\n```python\n>>> myfile.phy(phy = \"hmm\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nhmm This is first line of the file.\nhmm This is second line of the file.\nhmm This is third line of the file.\nhmm This is fourth line of the file.\nhmm This is fifth line of the file.\nhmm This is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nhmm This is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n#### deasteriphy()\nThis will revert the changes caused by phy(phy).\n```python\n>>> myfile.dephy(phy = \"mum\")\n```\nThis will be the final content of the sample.txt.\n```\nThis is first line of the file.\nThis is second line of the file.\nThis is third line of the file.\nThis is fourth line of the file.\nThis is fifth line of the file.\nThis is sixth line of the file.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis is n(th) line of the file.\n```\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome.
