    "description": "svyn\n====\n\nsvyn is an svn helper. It allows you to specify some typical repository\ninformation in a config file, or use an established convention, and\nsimplifies several common commands based on that information.\nIf you typically branch from a shared trunk, or operate on\nseveral different repositories and would like a couple shortcuts, svyn might\nbe for you. Right now branching and listing/searching branches, as well as\nsimple release tagging are the entirety of its powers.\nFuture features may include support for file history\ninformation and repository introspection.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nSadly, ``pysvn`` is a difficult dependency to manage. I am omitting from the\nsetup file as it cannot be automatically installed due to a host of platform and SVN version\nissues. You will need to get it wherever you want to use ``svyn`` yourself.\n\nI recommend `downloading <http://pysvn.tigris.org/project_downloads.html>`_ the appropriate\nbinaries for your svn and python version. ``svn --version`` and ``python --version`` will\nlet you know what you need.\n\nAside from that,\n\n::\n\n    pip install svyn\n\nshould get you where you need to go.\n\nDefault Behavior\n----------------\n\nWith no ``.svyn.conf``, svyn will examine the working directory as a working copy.\nIt will split the repo URL path and look for the default ``branches``, ``copy_source`` and\n``release`` values (``branches``, ``trunk``, ``tags``) as path parts. It will then try\nto determine the working base of your repo and use the defaults for other operations. If\nyou commonly work on portions of a repo that follow these conventions, you probably won't\nneed to make a ``.svyn.conf``. If your working directory is not a working copy, svyn\nwill failover to the ``default`` section of ``.svyn.conf``.\n\n.svyn.conf\n----------\n\nThe .svyn.conf file contains optional repo information in .ini format. It\nis available should your repo naming scheme follow a different convention.\nIt can handle multiple sections. Each section should specify\nthree variables:\n\n* ``base``: Fully-qualified path (svn+ssh:// or file:///) to the deepest part of the subtree in which you are interested.\n* ``branches``: The path to where your branches are stored.\n* ``copy_source``: The source directory from which branches will be copied.\n* ``release``: The directory where numbered releases are stored\n\nThe ``branches``, ``copy_source``, ``release`` should be relative to the\n``base``. The ``base`` is essentially concatenated with the with one of the\nother variables to generate the full address for svn.\n\nExample conf section\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n    [default]\n    base = svn+ssh://svn/svnroot/some/project/source\n    branches = splinters\n    copy_source = board\n\nIn this case, ``svyn branch foo`` would use\n``svn+ssh://svn/svnroot/some/project/source/board`` as the source for new\nbranches, which it would then copy to ``svn+ssh://svn/svnroot/some/project/source/splinters/foo``\n\nThe section to be searched for the variables can be set for any svyn command\nwith the ``-c`` flag, so ``svyn -c bar_section branch`` would then use variables\nfrom ``[bar_section]`` in the ``.svyn.conf`` file.\n\nCommands\n--------\n\nSee ``svyn -h`` and ``svyn {command} -h`` for quick help\n\n* branch: Copies head of trunk to a branc, named by the command arg.\n* list: Lists current branches, -s to search -m for current user is last committer.\n* release: Copies specified trunk rev to release dir. Will auto-calculate release\n  number or can be overridden.",
