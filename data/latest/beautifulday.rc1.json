    "description": "# Purpose of Program\n\nPrint out simple or extended weather reports for any Canadian city to a console.\n\nWeb scraping is not the best approach for this problem but is a good skill to have.  Using it for this will require that I update it every time Weather Canada changes the look and feel of their site.  Since this is not a skill I will use often it will force me to go back and fix it so that I can use what I have learned easily.\n\n## Contributing\n\n\nI welcome contributions from others wanting to learn about Webscraping.  Things here can always be improved.\n\nPlease do pull requests from the *devel* branch.  Discussed proposed changes in the *Issue Tracker* prior to sending a big pull request.\n\nCode should follow *PEP-8* standards as much as possible.  Also please use doctrings for all functions and classes you want to add.  It will help others that are learning as well.\n\n## Install\n\n    sudo pip3 install beautifulday\n\n## Usage\n\n\nFind the weather code for your city by visiting  https://weather.gc.ca/\n\nThe code is in the url of your weather report.\n\n### help menu\n\n    my_weather -h\n\n    usage: my_weather [-h] -c CODE [-e]\n\n    Use argparsing to allow more control over output\n\n    optional arguments:\n    -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n    -c CODE, --code CODE  Enter the city code from weather.gc.ca\n    -e, --extended        Add the extended forecast\n\n### Example 1 - Sudbury ON, simple forecast\n\n    my_weather -c on-40\n\n    Greater Sudbury, ON - 7:00 AM EDT Monday 22 April 2019\n    No Alerts in effect\n    Temperature: 4°C\n    Conditions: Cloudy\n    Humidity: 75%\n    Wind: ENE 16 km/h\n    Normals: High: 11°C  Low: 0°C\n    Sunrise: 6:25 EDT  Sunset:20:20 EDT\n\n\n### Example 2 - Timmins ON, simple forecast (includes weather alerts)\n\n    my_weather -c on-127\n\n    Timmins, ON - 7:00 AM EDT Monday 22 April 2019\n    FREEZING RAIN WARNING\n    RAINFALL WARNING\n    Temperature: -2°C\n    Conditions: Light Freezing Rain\n    Humidity: 88%\n    Wind: E 13 km/h\n    Normals: High: 11°C  Low: -2°C\n    Sunrise: 6:23 EDT  Sunset:20:25 EDT\n\n\n\n### Example 3 Halifax NS, extended forecast\n\n    my_weather -c ns-19 -e\n\n    Halifax, NS - 8:38 AM ADT Monday 22 April 2019\n    SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT\n    Temperature: 11°C\n    Conditions: Light Rain\n    Humidity: 100%\n    Wind: S 9 km/h\n    Normals: High: 10°C  Low: 2°C\n    Sunrise: 6:19 ADT  Sunset:20:07 ADT\n    ---Extended Forecast---\n    Today - Periods of rain.

They make xml files available for use and would be a better option for building a web app.  More info at the following link.\n\n[Environment and Climate Change Canada](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/citypage-weather/readme_citypageweather-datamart_en/)\n\n\n",
