    "description": "# What is `judgyprophet`?\n\n`judgyprophet` is a Bayesian forecasting algorithm based on Prophet, that enables forecasting while using information known by the business about future events. The aim is to enable users to perform forecasting with *judgmental adjustment*, in a way that is mathematically as sound as possible.\n\nSome events will have a big effect on your timeseries. Some of which you are aware of ahead of time. For example:\n\n* An existing product entering a new market.\n* A price change to a product.\n\nThese events will typically cause a large change in your timeseries of e.g. product sales, which a standard statistical forecast will consistently underestimate.\n\nThe business will often have good estimates (or at least better than your statistical forecast) about how these events will affect your timeseries. But this is difficult to encode into your statistical forecasting algorithm. One option is to use a regressor, but this typically works poorly. This is because you have no data on the event before it occurs, and the statistical forecast does not know how to balance the information in your regressor and trend after the event occurs (which can lead to erratic behaviour).\n\n`judgyprophet` solves this problem by encoding the business estimate of how the event will affect the forecast (the judgmental adjustment) as a Bayesian informative prior.\n\nBefore the event occurs, this business information is used to reflect the forecast of what will happen post-event e.g. the estimated uplift in product sales once the event has happened. After the event occurs, we update what the business *thinks* will happen, with what we *see* happening in the actuals. This is done using standard Bayesian updating.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n### 1. install `judgyprophet` python package using `pip`\n\n```\npip install judgyprophet\n```\n\n### 2. compile the `STAN` model\n\n`judgyprophet` depends on `STAN`, whose models have to be compiled before running.\n\nSo to use `judgyprophet`, you have to compile the model. Do this in the shell using\n\n```\npython -c \"from judgyprophet import JudgyProphet; JudgyProphet().compile()\"\n```\n\nor in python using\n```python\nfrom judgyprophet import JudgyProphet\n\nJudgyProphet().compile()\n```\n\nThis will take a while. But you only have to run this once, after the initial install.\n\n# Documentation\n\nFull documentation is available on our Github Pages site [here](https://astrazeneca.github.io/judgyprophet/).\n\nScroll down for a quickstart tutorial.\n\nA runnable jupyter notebook version of the quickstart tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/AstraZeneca/judgyprophet/blob/main/tutorials/Quickstart.ipynb)\n\n# Roadmap\n\nSome things on our roadmap:\n\n* Currently `judgyprophet` `STAN` file is only tested on Unix-based Linux or Mac machines. We aim to fully test Windows machines ASAP.\n* Option to run full MCMC, rather than just L-BFGS.\n* Prediction intervals\n* Regressors/holidays\n\n\n# Quickstart Tutorial\n\nImagine your business currently operates in the US, but is launching its product in Europe. As a result it anticipates a sharp uptake in sales (which it has an estimate of). As your forecasting team, they come to you and ask you to account for this.\n\nLet's look at how we might do this using `judgyprophet` with some example data, where we know what happened. First let's plot this:\n\n\n```python\nfrom judgyprophet.tutorials.resources import get_trend_event\n\nexample_data = get_trend_event()\np = example_data.plot.line()\n```\n\n\n\n![png](docs/output_1_0.png)\n\n\n\nWe can see that product sales increased sharply from about September 2020. Suppose it was a launch in a new market, and that the business had an initial estimate of the impact in May 2020. The business expected the slope increase to be 6.\n\nLet's use `judgyprophet` to forecast this series from May 2020. We do this by encoding the initial business estimate as a _trend event_.\n\n\n```python\nfrom judgyprophet import JudgyProphet\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Create the expected trend events by consulting with the business\ntrend_events = [\n    {'name': \"New market entry\", 'index': '2020-09-01', 'm0': 6}\n]\n\n\n# Cutoff the data to May 2020\ndata_may2020 = example_data.loc[:\"2020-05-01\"]\n\n# Make the forecast with the business estimated level event\n# We have no level events, so just provide the empty list.\njp = JudgyProphet()\n# Because the event is beyond the actuals, judgyprophet throws a warning.\n#    This is just because the Bayesian model at the event has no actuals to learn from.\n#    The event is still used in predictions.\njp.fit(\n    data=data_may2020,\n    level_events=[],\n    trend_events=trend_events,\n    # Set random seed for reproducibility\n    seed=13\n)\npredictions = jp.predict(horizon=12)\n```\n\n    INFO:judgyprophet.judgyprophet:Rescaling onto 0-mean, 1-sd.\n    WARNING:judgyprophet.judgyprophet:Post-event data for trend event New market entry less than 0 points.

This is where `judgyprophet` comes into its own.\n\nOnce actuals are observed after the event has taken place, `judgyprophet` updates its estimate of what the event impact is. Let's look at this in action:\n\n\n```python\n# Cutoff the data to January 2021\ndata_jan2021 = example_data.loc[:\"2021-01-01\"]\n\n# Reforecast using the new actuals, not we are at Jan 2021\njp = JudgyProphet()\njp.fit(\n    data=data_jan2021,\n    level_events=[],\n    trend_events=trend_events,\n    # Set random seed for reproducibility\n    seed=13\n)\npredictions = jp.predict(horizon=12)\n```\n\n    INFO:judgyprophet.judgyprophet:Rescaling onto 0-mean, 1-sd.\n    INFO:judgyprophet.judgyprophet:Adding trend event New market entry to model.

You can add many trend events into a single forecasting horizon, add damping. You can also add level events – changes in the forecasting level; and seasonality see our other tutorials for details about this.\n",
