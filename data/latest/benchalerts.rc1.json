    "description": "# benchalerts\n\nA package to facilitate automated alerting based on Conbench data.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis package is intended to make the following steps easier in CI. Before these steps,\nit is assumed that an execution environment has performed a run of benchmarks and\nsubmitted the results to Conbench.\n\n- Hit the Conbench API to understand if there were any:\n    - errors\n    - regressions (with configuration for how these regressions may be detected)\n    - improvements (with configuration for how these improvements may be detected)\n- Format and submit a summary of these findings to various places (again, with\n  configuration):\n    - GitHub Status on a commit\n    - GitHub Check on a commit with a Markdown summary\n\nIn the future, there will be more places to submit alerts/reports/summaries, and more\nconfiguration possible.\n\nCurrently, the way to configure these workflows in CI is to create and run a Python\nscript that imports this package and runs a workflow, like so:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom benchalerts import update_github_check_based_on_regressions\n\nupdate_github_check_based_on_regressions(\n    contender_sha=os.environ[\"GITHUB_SHA\"], repo=\"my_org/my_repo\"\n)\n```\n\nSee the docstrings of each function for more details on how to configure the workflow,\nincluding how to set up the required environment variables.\n\n## GitHub App Authentication\n\nThe preferred method that `benchalerts` recommends for authenticating and posting to\nGitHub is to use a machine user called a [GitHub\nApp](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps).\nUsing an App will allow you to post using a \"bot\" entity without taking up a seat in\nyour organization, and will allow you to use the extra features of the [Checks\nAPI](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api). These\nfeatures give much more context when analyzing benchmark runs.\n\nEach Conbench server must create its own GitHub App for security reasons. To do so,\nfollow these instructions.\n\n### Creating a GitHub App to work with `benchalerts`\n\n1. Go to the official [GitHub\n    instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)\n    for creating an App.\n    - If you are an admin of your GitHub organization, follow the instructions for \"a\n        GitHub App owned by an organization.\" This method is preferred because the org\n        will own the app instead of a user, who may not be part of the org in the\n        future. (This will not affect the identity of the bot that posts to GitHub, just\n        the ownership of the App.)\n    - If not, you can follow the instructions for \"a GitHub App owned by a personal\n        account.\" You will send an installation request to org admins after creating the\n        app. You can always transfer the ownership of the app to an org later.\n1. For the App Name, use `conbench-<your org>`.\n1. For the Homepage URL, use the link to your Conbench server.\n1. Ignore the Callback URL and Setup URL.\n1. Uncheck the \"Active\" box under Webhook. Since this App will not be an active service,\n    we don't need GitHub to push webhook events to the App.\n1. For full use of this package, the App requires the following permissions:\n    - Repository > Checks > Read and Write\n    - Repository > Commit statuses > Read and Write\n    - Repository > Pull requests > Read and Write\n1. After creating the App, save the App ID for later.\n1. For the App's photo, use [this\n   one](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61704591).\n1. In the App Settings, scroll down to Private Keys and generate a private key. This\n    will download a file to your computer. Treat the contents of this file like a\n    password.\n1. IMPORTANT: After creation, go to\n    `https://github.com/apps/<YOUR_APP_NAME>/installations/new` to install the new App\n    on the repos you'd like it to be able to post to. You must be a member of the\n    organization to install the App on. If you are not an admin, an email request will\n    be sent to org admins, which must be approved.\n\n### Running `benchalerts` as the GitHub App you created\n\nAll that's necessary to use `benchalerts` workflows that post to GitHub as your App is\nto set the following environment variables:\n\n- `GITHUB_APP_ID` - the App ID from above\n- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - the _contents_ of the private key file from above. This is\n    a multiline file, so ensure you quote the contents correctly if necessary.\n\nSince `benchalerts` is usually used in CI, it's recommended to set these two environment\nvariables in your CI pipeline as secret env vars. Most CI systems have a mechanism for\ndoing this. For security reasons, do not check these values into version control.\n\n## License information\n\nCopyright (c) 2022, Voltron Data.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this\nfile except in compliance with the License.
