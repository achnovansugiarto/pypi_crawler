(If you want to see the\ninfo in other views like product recommendations, this is not needed.)\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOnce configured, hints will apperar as an optional column in sale order\nlines or in products tree.\n\nIn the general products view, general sales info is shown. Meanwhile, in the\nsale lines field we can see this field in context by simply filtering partner\nsales.\n\nOnly salespeople can access this information.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Services are not taken into consideration.\n* A widget could be created on top of the main field to have nicer icons and\n  probably colors.\n* For the near future, a configurable granularity would be desirable, so\n  behaviour could be changed to years, months or days as the period of choice.\n  To simplify this module, only weekly periods will be considered for now.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting/issues/new?body=module:%20product_sold_by_delivery_week%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * David Vidal\n  * Carlos Dauden\n  * César A.
