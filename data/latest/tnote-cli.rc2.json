    "description": "# tnote-cli\nA simple notes Command line tool, because I really got tired of either:\n\nA. going from the terminal into another app to write something down for later\nor \nB. Forgetting which configuration file is where and not having a convenient place where all my notes could be kept\n\nPlus I really just wanted a project to work on.\n\n## Installation \n\n```\npip install tnote-cli\n```\n\n\n## Usage \n\nUsing tnote is pretty simple when it really comes down to it as there is only one command that has several options. \n\n\n#### Index\n\nThe index of all the notes you've created can be accessed by `$ tnote` with no arguments.\nAt any point you can use `$ tn` as it is the same because who has time for all those extra keystrokes.\n\n```\n$ tnote \n|-------------------------INDEX-------------------------|\n\n\n|-------------------------RECENT------------------------|\n Note ID: todo\n Name: todo.md\n Path: /Users/username/.tnote/notes/todo.md\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\n    \n            _________________________________\n            \n\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\n Note ID: todo\n Name: todo.md\n Path: /Users/username/.tnote/notes/todo.md\n|-------------------------------------------------------|\n\n```\nAt first your index obviously won't look like this but create a note and you'll be good.\nUp at the top there it will show you want is your most recently edited note which can be accessed \nusing the `$ -r` flag.\n\n#### Creating and Editing Notes\n\nTo create a new note you need only type in a name for a note like so `$ tn EXAMPLE` and a note will be created and \nyou'll begin editing it. You can also specify editing with the `$ -e` flag. The editor used will be the `$EDITOR` \nenvironment variable but it can also be changed in the config at `~/.tnote.json`\n\n```\n$ tnote -e Example\n```\n\n```\n$ tn Example\n```\n\n#### View\n\nTnote was designed with using markdown in mind as it is how I frequently take notes as \nsuch if you wish to render it from your terminal use the view flag.\n```\n$ tnote -v Example\n```\n\n#### Moving and Renaming\nIf you wish to rename a file simply do so by passing the same path other than the filename to the move option:\n```\n$ tnote Example -m ~/tnote/notes/new_name.md \n```\notherwise just pass a fully qualified path with filename to move the file:\n```\n$ tnote Example -m ~/Example.md\n```\n\n\n#### Delete\nTo permenantly delete a note:\n```\n$ tnote -d Example\n```\n\n\n#### Change ID\nIF you want to change the Id you use to access notes you do so as shown below \n``` \n$ tnote Example -i new-id\n```\nto access this note in the future you'll use `new-id`\n\n#### Execute \n\nFrom time to time I like to have some simple scripts on-hand for quick access \nso I have allowed a way to simply execute from my notes \n\nExecute a file that has permissions:\n```\ntnote Script -x\n```\n\nGive a file permission (chmod) and execute it:\n```\ntnote Script -xx\n```\n\n\n",
