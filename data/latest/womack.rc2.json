    "description": "======\nWomack\n======\n\nWomack is a service that you can use to push realtime events between\nyour regular, plain-old, non-websockety web application and\nclients. It is built on top of `gevent-socketio`_ and `redis`_.\n\nWhy Womack?\n-----------\n\nYou want to write an application, like a game or shared calendar or\ngroup chat or some kind of game that involves chatting about calendars\nin a group. You want the convenience of writing most of your\napplication in the regular, stateless, blocking way you are used to\nwriting web applications, and access to all of the nice tools that you\nhave over in that box. But you also want your calendar game UI to be\nsnappy and realtime and not rely on polling or keeping track of game\nstate in two places. So you put a service like Womack in the\nmiddle and use it to push real-time events to clients as your\nblocking application receives input and does its thing in the\ndatabase or S3 or wherever.\n\n\nQuickstart:\n-----------\n\n1. Install and start `redis`_\n\n2. Clone this repository.\n\n3. Make a `virtualenv`_, then install dependencies with ``make server``\n\n   .. note ::\n\n      On Windows you may need to install gevent manually.\n\n4. Install Womack: ``python setup.py develop``\n\n5. Start womack server: ``womack``\n\n7. In a browser, load http://localhost:8111/test.html\n\n8. In a python shell, enter::\n\n     >>> import womack.publish\n     >>> wm = womack.publish.Publisher()\n     >>> wm.publish('hello', {'hello': 'world'})\n\n   You should see the message *\"hello world\"* appear immediately in\n   the browser.\n\n\nSimilar projects\n----------------\n\nWomack was heavily inspired by and includes some client-side code\nderived from the excellent nodejs project `juggernaut`_ and the\n`python client`_ for juggernaut.\n\nWomack has slightly different internal message routing from\njuggernaut, making it (in our opinion at least) more appropriate for\nmulti-tenant applications. And it is also easier for python\nprogrammers to customize, since it is written in python.\n\nAbout the name\n--------------\n\n`You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure`_ ...\n\n\n.. _redis : http://redis.io/\n.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\n.. _gevent-socketio: https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio\n.. _juggernaut: https://github.com/maccman/juggernaut\n.. _python client: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-juggernaut\n.. _You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_110th_Street#Soundtrack",
