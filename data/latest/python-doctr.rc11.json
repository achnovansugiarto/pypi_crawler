It will directly fit straight boxes\non your page and return straight boxes, which makes it the fastest option.\n\n- If you want the predictor to output straight boxes (no matter the orientation of your pages, the final localizations\nwill be converted to straight boxes), you need to pass `export_as_straight_boxes=True` in the predictor. Otherwise, if `assume_straight_pages=False`, it will return rotated bounding boxes (potentially with an angle of 0°).\n\nIf both options are set to False, the predictor will always fit and return rotated boxes.\n\n\nTo interpret your model's predictions, you can visualize them interactively as follows:\n\n```python\nresult.show(doc)\n```\n\n![Visualization sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.1.1/doctr_example_script.gif)\n\nOr even rebuild the original document from its predictions:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsynthetic_pages = result.synthesize()\nplt.imshow(synthetic_pages[0]); plt.axis('off'); plt.show()\n```\n\n![Synthesis sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.3.1/synthesized_sample.png)\n\n\nThe `ocr_predictor` returns a `Document` object with a nested structure (with `Page`, `Block`, `Line`, `Word`, `Artefact`).\nTo get a better understanding of our document model, check our [documentation](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/modules/io.html#document-structure):\n\nYou can also export them as a nested dict, more appropriate for JSON format:\n\n```python\njson_output = result.export()\n```\n\n### If you are looking for support from the Mindee team\n[![Bad OCR test detection image asking the developer if they need help](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.5.1/doctr-need-help.png)](https://mindee.com/product/doctr)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nPython 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are required to install docTR.\n\nSince we use [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/), you will need extra dependencies if you are not running Linux.\n\nFor MacOS users, you can install them as follows:\n```shell\nbrew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi\n```\n\nFor Windows users, those dependencies are included in GTK. You can find the latest installer over [here](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases).\n\n### Latest release\n\nYou can then install the latest release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/python-doctr/) as follows:\n\n```shell\npip install python-doctr\n```\n> :warning: Please note that the basic installation is not standalone, as it does not provide a deep learning framework, which is required for the package to run.\n\nWe try to keep framework-specific dependencies to a minimum. You can install framework-specific builds as follows:\n\n```shell\n# for TensorFlow\npip install \"python-doctr[tf]\"\n# for PyTorch\npip install \"python-doctr[torch]\"\n```\n\nFor MacBooks with M1 chip, you will need some additional packages or specific versions:\n\n- TensorFlow 2: [metal plugin](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/)\n- PyTorch: [version >= 1.12.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)\n\n### Developer mode\nAlternatively, you can install it from source, which will require you to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\nFirst clone the project repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/mindee/doctr.git\npip install -e doctr/.\n```\n\nAgain, if you prefer to avoid the risk of missing dependencies, you can install the TensorFlow or the PyTorch build:\n```shell\n# for TensorFlow\npip install -e doctr/.[tf]\n# for PyTorch\npip install -e doctr/.[torch]\n```\n\n\n## Models architectures\nCredits where it's due: this repository is implementing, among others, architectures from published research papers.\n\n### Text Detection\n- DBNet: [Real-time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08947.pdf).\n- LinkNet: [LinkNet: Exploiting Encoder Representations for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03718.pdf)\n\n### Text Recognition\n- CRNN: [An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Image-based Sequence Recognition and Its Application to Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf).\n- SAR: [Show, Attend and Read:A Simple and Strong Baseline for Irregular Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00751.pdf).\n- MASTER: [MASTER: Multi-Aspect Non-local Network for Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02562.pdf).\n- ViTSTR: [Vision Transformer for Fast and Efficient Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08582.pdf).\n\n\n## More goodies\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/) for detailed specifications.\n\n\n### Demo app\n\nA minimal demo app is provided for you to play with our end-to-end OCR models!\n\n![Demo app](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.3.0/demo_update.png)\n\n#### Live demo\n\nCourtesy of :hugs: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) :hugs:, docTR has now a fully deployed version available on [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)!\nCheck it out [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mindee/doctr)\n\n#### Running it locally\n\nIf you prefer to use it locally, there is an extra dependency ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) that is required.\n\n##### Tensorflow version\n```shell\npip install -r demo/tf-requirements.txt\n```\nThen run your app in your default browser with:\n\n```shell\nUSE_TF=1 streamlit run demo/app.py\n```\n\n##### PyTorch version\n```shell\npip install -r demo/pt-requirements.txt\n```\nThen run your app in your default browser with:\n\n```shell\nUSE_TORCH=1 streamlit run demo/app.py\n```\n\n#### TensorFlow.js\n\nInstead of having your demo actually running Python, you would prefer to run everything in your web browser?\nCheck out our [TensorFlow.js demo](https://github.com/mindee/doctr-tfjs-demo) to get started!\n\n![TFJS demo](https://github.com/mindee/doctr-tfjs-demo/releases/download/v0.1-models/demo_illustration_mini.png)\n\n\n### Docker container\n\nIf you wish to deploy containerized environments, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a docker image:\n\n```shell\ndocker build . -t <YOUR_IMAGE_TAG>\n```\n\n### Example script\n\nAn example script is provided for a simple documentation analysis of a PDF or image file:\n\n```shell\npython scripts/analyze.py path/to/your/doc.pdf\n```\nAll script arguments can be checked using `python scripts/analyze.py --help`\n\n\n### Minimal API integration\n\nLooking to integrate docTR into your API? Here is a template to get you started with a fully working API using the wonderful [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework.\n\n#### Deploy your API locally\nSpecific dependencies are required to run the API template, which you can install as follows:\n```shell\npip install -r api/requirements.txt\n```\nYou can now run your API locally:\n\n```shell\nuvicorn --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port=8002 --app-dir api/ app.main:app\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run the same server on a docker container if you prefer using:\n```shell\nPORT=8002 docker-compose up -d --build\n```\n\n#### What you have deployed\n\nYour API should now be running locally on your port 8002. Access your automatically-built documentation at [http://localhost:8002/redoc](http://localhost:8002/redoc) and enjoy your three functional routes (\"/detection\", \"/recognition\", \"/ocr\"). Here is an example with Python to send a request to the OCR route:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nwith open('/path/to/your/doc.jpg', 'rb') as f:\n    data = f.read()\nresponse = requests.post(\"http://localhost:8002/ocr\", files={'file': data}).json()\n```\n\n### Example notebooks\nLooking for more illustrations of docTR features? You might want to check the [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/tree/main/notebooks) designed to give you a broader overview.\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you wish to cite this project, feel free to use this [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) reference:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{doctr2021,\n    title={docTR: Document Text Recognition},\n    author={Mindee},\n    year={2021},\n    publisher = {GitHub},\n    howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/mindee/doctr}}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you scrolled down to this section, you most likely appreciate open source. Do you feel like extending the range of our supported characters? Or perhaps submitting a paper implementation? Or contributing in any other way?\n\nYou're in luck, we compiled a short guide (cf. [`CONTRIBUTING`](CONTRIBUTING.md)) for you to easily do so!\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the Apache 2.0 License. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for more information.\n\n",
