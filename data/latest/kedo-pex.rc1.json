    "description": "PEX\n===\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/pantsbuild/pex.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/pantsbuild/pex\n\npex is a library for generating .pex (Python EXecutable) files which are\nexecutable Python environments in the spirit of `virtualenvs <http://virtualenv.org>`_.\npex is an expansion upon the ideas outlined in\n`PEP 441 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/>`_\nand makes the deployment of Python applications as simple as ``cp``.  pex files may even\ninclude multiple platform-specific Python distributions, meaning that a single pex file\ncan be portable across Linux and OS X.\n\npex files can be built using the ``pex`` tool.  Build systems such as `Pants\n<http://pantsbuild.org/>`_, `Buck <http://facebook.github.io/buck/>`_, and  `{py}gradle <https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle>`_  also\nsupport building .pex files directly.\n\nStill unsure about what pex does or how it works?  Watch this quick lightning\ntalk: `WTF is PEX? <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmpnGhRwsu0>`_.\n\npex is licensed under the Apache2 license.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install pex, simply\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install pex\n\nYou can also build pex in a git clone using tox:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ tox -e py27-package\n    $ cp dist/pex ~/bin\n\nThis builds a pex binary in ``dist/pex`` that can be copied onto your ``$PATH``.\nThe advantage to this approach is that it keeps your Python environment as empty as\npossible and is more in-line with what pex does philosophically.\n\n\nSimple Examples\n===============\n\nLaunch an interpreter with ``requests``, ``flask`` and ``psutil`` in the environment:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex requests flask 'psutil>2,<3'\n\nOr instead freeze your current virtualenv via requirements.txt and execute it anywhere:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex -r <(pip freeze) -o my_virtualenv.pex\n    $ deactivate\n    $ ./my_virtualenv.pex\n\nRun webserver.py in an environment containing ``flask`` as a quick way to experiment:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex flask -- webserver.py\n\nLaunch Sphinx in an ephemeral pex environment using the Sphinx entry point ``sphinx:main``:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex sphinx -e sphinx:main -- --help\n\nBuild a standalone pex binary into ``pex.pex`` using the ``pex`` console_scripts entry point:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex pex -c pex -o pex.pex\n\nYou can also build pex files that use a specific interpreter type:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pex pex -c pex --python=pypy -o pypy-pex.pex\n\nMost pex options compose well with one another, so the above commands can be\nmixed and matched.  For a full list of options, just type ``pex --help``.\n\n\nIntegrating pex into your workflow\n==================================\n\nIf you use tox (and you should!), a simple way to integrate pex into your\nworkflow is to add a packaging test environment to your ``tox.ini``:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [testenv:package]\n    deps = pex\n    commands = pex . -o dist/app.pex\n\nThen ``tox -e package`` will produce a relocateable copy of your application\nthat you can copy to staging or production environments.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nMore documentation about pex, building .pex files, and how .pex files work\nis available at https://pex.readthedocs.io.\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\npex uses `tox <https://testrun.org/tox/en/latest/>`_ for test and development automation.  To run\nthe test suite, just invoke tox:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ tox\n\nIf you don't have tox, you can generate a pex of tox:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    $ pex tox -c tox -o ~/bin/tox\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nTo contribute, follow these instructions: http://pantsbuild.org/howto_contribute.html\n\nRelease Notes\n=============\n\n1.2.7\n-----\n\n* Sort keys in PEX-INFO file so the output is deterministic.

See the notes `here\n  <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/blob/master/docs/buildingpex.rst#tailoring-pex-execution-at-build-time>`_.\n  `#128 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/128>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: PEX_PROFILE_FILENAME and PEX_PROFILE_SORT were not respected.\n  `#154 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/154>`_.\n\n* Adds the ``bdist_pex`` command to setuptools.\n  `#99 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/99>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: We did not normalize package names in ``ResolvableSet``, so it was possible to depend on\n  ``sphinx`` and ``Sphinx-1.4a0.tar.gz`` and get two versions build and included into the pex.\n  `#147 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/147>`_.\n\n* Adds a pex-identifying User-Agent. `#101 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/101>`_.\n\n1.0.3\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Accommodate OSX ``Python`` python binaries.  Previously the OSX python distributions shipped\n  with OSX, XCode and available via https://www.python.org/downloads/ could fail to be detected using\n  the ``PythonInterpreter`` class.\n  Fixes `#144 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/144>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: PEX_SCRIPT failed when the script was from a not-zip-safe egg.\n  Original PR `#139 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/139>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: ``sys.exit`` called without arguments would cause `None` to be printed on stderr since pex 1.0.1.\n  `#143 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/143>`_.\n\n1.0.2\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: PEX-INFO values were overridden by environment ``Variables`` with default values that were\n  not explicitly set in the environment.\n  Fixes `#135 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/135>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: Since `69649c1 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/commit/69649c1>`_ we have been unpatching\n  the side-effects of ``sys.modules`` after ``PEX.execute``.  This takes all modules imported during\n  the PEX lifecycle and sets all their attributes to ``None``.  Unfortunately, ``sys.excepthook``,\n  ``atexit`` and ``__del__`` may still try to operate using these tainted modules, causing exceptions\n  on interpreter teardown.  This reverts just the ``sys`` unpatching so that the abovementioned\n  teardown hooks behave more predictably.\n  Fixes `#141 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/141>`_.\n\n1.0.1\n-----\n\n* Allow PEXBuilder to optionally copy files into the PEX environment instead of hard-linking them.\n\n* Allow PEXBuilder to optionally skip precompilation of .py files into .pyc files.\n\n* Bug fix: PEXBuilder did not respect the target interpreter when compiling source to bytecode.\n  Fixes `#127 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/127>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: Fix complex resolutions when using a cache.\n  Fixes: `#120 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/120>`_.\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\nThe 1.0.0 release of pex introduces a few breaking changes: ``pex -r`` now takes requirements.txt files\ninstead of requirement specs, ``pex -s`` has now been removed since source specs are accepted as arguments,\nand ``pex -p`` has been removed in favor of its alias ``pex -o``.\n\nThe pex *command line interface* now adheres to semver insofar as backwards incompatible CLI\nchanges will invoke a major version change.  Any backwards incompatible changes to the PEX\nenvironment variable semantics will also result in a major version change.  The pex *API* adheres\nto semver insofar as backwards incompatible API changes will invoke minor version changes.\n\nFor users of the PEX API, it is recommended to add minor version ranges, e.g. ``pex>=1.0,<1.1``.\nFor users of the PEX CLI, major version ranges such as ``pex>=1,<2`` should be sufficient.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Removes the ``-s`` option in favor of specifying directories directly as\n  arguments to the pex command line.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: ``pex -r`` now takes requirements.txt filenames and *not* requirement\n  specs.  Requirement specs are now passed as arguments to the pex tool.  Use ``--`` to escape\n  command line arguments passed to interpreters spawned by pex.  Implements\n  `#5 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/5>`_.\n\n* Adds a number of flag aliases to be more compatible with pip command lines: ``--no-index``,\n  ``-f``, ``--find-links``, ``--index-url``, ``--no-use-wheel``.  Removes ``-p`` in favor of\n  ``-o`` exclusively.\n\n* Adds ``--python-shebang`` option to the pex tool in order to set the ``#!`` shebang to an exact\n  path.  `#53 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/53>`_.\n\n* Adds support for ``PEX_PYTHON`` environment variable which will cause the pex file to reinvoke\n  itself using the interpreter specified, e.g. ``PEX_PYTHON=python3.4`` or\n  ``PEX_PYTHON=/exact/path/to/interpreter``.  `#27 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/27>`_.\n\n* Adds support for ``PEX_PATH`` environment variable which allows merging of PEX environments at\n  runtime.  This can be used to inject plugins or entry_points or modules from one PEX into\n  another without explicitly building them together. `#30 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/30>`_.\n\n* Consolidates documentation of ``PEX_`` environment variables and adds the ``--help-variables`` option\n  to the pex client.  Partially addresses `#13 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/13>`_.\n\n* Adds helper method to dump a package subdirectory onto disk from within a zipped PEX file.  This\n  can be useful for applications that know they're running within a PEX and would prefer some\n  static assets dumped to disk instead of running as an unzipped PEX file.\n  `#12 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/12>`_.\n\n* Now supports extras for static URLs and installable directories.\n  `#65 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/65>`_.\n\n* Adds ``-m`` and ``--entry-point`` alias to the existing ``-e`` option for entry points in\n  the pex tool to evoke the similarity to ``python -m``.\n\n* Adds console script support via ``-c/--script/--console-script`` and ``PEX_SCRIPT``.  This allows\n  you to reference the named entry point instead of the exact ``module:name`` pair.  Also supports\n  scripts defined in the ``scripts`` section of setup.py.\n  `#59 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/59>`_.\n\n* Adds more debugging information when encountering unresolvable requirements.\n  `#79 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/79>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: ``PEX_COVERAGE`` and ``PEX_PROFILE`` did not function correctly when SystemExit was raised.\n  Fixes `#81 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/81>`_.\n\n* Bug fix: Fixes caching in the PEX tool since we don't cache the source distributions of installable\n  directories.  `#24 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/24>`_.\n\n0.9.0\n-----\n\nThis is the last release before the 1.0.0 development branch is started.\n\n* Change the setuptools range to >=2.2,<16 by handling EntryPoint changes as well as\n  being flexible on whether ``pkg_resources`` is a package or a module.  Fixes\n  `#55 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/55>`_ and\n  `#34 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/34>`_.\n\n* Adds option groups to the pex tool to make the help output slightly more readable.\n\n* Bug fix: Make ``pip install pex`` work better by removing ``extras_requires`` on the\n  ``console_script`` entry point.  Fixes `#48 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/48>`_\n\n* New feature: Adds an interpreter cache to the ``pex`` tool.  If the user does not explicitly\n  disable the wheel feature and attempts to build a pex with wheels but does not have the wheel\n  package installed, pex will download it in order to make the feature work.\n  Implements `#47 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/47>`_ in order to\n  fix `#48 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/48>`_\n\n0.8.6\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Honor installed sys.excepthook in pex teardown.\n  `RB #1733 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1733>`_\n\n* Bug fix: ``UrllibContext`` used ``replace`` as a keyword argument for ``bytes.decode``\n  but this only works on Python 3.  `Pull Request #46 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/46>`_\n\n0.8.5\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Fixup string formatting in pex/bin/pex.py to support Python 2.6\n  `Pull Request #40 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/40>`_\n\n0.8.4\n-----\n\n* Performance improvement: Speed up the best-case scenario of dependency resolution.\n  `RB #1685 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1685>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Change from ``uuid4().get_hex()`` to ``uuid4().hex`` to maintain Python3\n  compatibility of pex.common.\n  `Pull Request #39 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/39>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Actually cache the results of translation.  Previously bdist translations\n  would be created in a temporary directory even if a cache location was specified.\n  `RB #1666 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1666>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Support all potential abi tag permutations when determining platform\n  compatibility.\n  `Pull Request #33 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/33>`_\n\n0.8.3\n-----\n\n* Performance improvement: Don't always write packages to disk if they've already been\n  cached.  This can significantly speed up launching PEX files with a large\n  number of non-zip-safe dependencies.\n  `RB #1642 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1642>`_\n\n0.8.2\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Allow pex 0.8.x to parse pex files produced by earlier versions of\n  pex and twitter.common.python.\n\n* Pin pex to setuptools prior to 9.x until we have a chance to make changes\n  related to PEP440 and the change of pkg_resources.py to a package.\n\n0.8.1\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Fix issue where it'd be possible to ``os.path.getmtime`` on a remote ``Link`` object\n  `Issue #29 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/29>`_\n\n0.8.0\n-----\n\n* *API change*: Decouple translation from package iteration.  This removes\n  the Obtainer construct entirely, which likely means if you're using PEX as\n  a library, you will need to change your code if you were doing anything\n  nontrivial.  This adds a couple new options to ``resolve`` but simplifies\n  the story around how to cache packages.\n  `RB #785 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/785/>`_\n\n* Refactor http handling in pex to allow for alternate http implementations.  Adds support\n  for `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_,\n  improving both performance and security.   For more information, read the commit notes at\n  `91c7f32 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/commit/91c7f324085c18af714d35947b603a5f60aeb682>`_.\n  `RB #778 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/778/>`_\n\n* Improvements to API documentation throughout.\n\n* Renamed ``Tracer`` to ``TraceLogger`` to prevent nondeterministic isort ordering.\n\n* Refactor tox.ini to increase the number of environment combinations and improve coverage.\n\n* Adds HTTP retry support for the RequestsContext.\n  `RB #1303 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1303/>`_\n\n* Make pex --version correct.\n  `Issue #19 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/19>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Fix over-aggressive sys.modules scrubbing for namespace packages.  Under\n  certain circumstances, namespace packages in site-packages could conflict with packages\n  within a PEX, causing them to fail importing.\n  `RB #1378 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1378/>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Replace uses of ``os.unsetenv(...)`` with ``del os.environ[...]``\n  `Pull Request #11 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/11>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Scrub sys.path and sys.modules based upon both supplied path and\n  realpath of files and directories.  Newer versions of virtualenv on Linux symlink site-packages\n  which caused those packages to not be removed from sys.path correctly.\n  `Issue #21 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/21>`_\n\n* Bug fix: The pex -s option was not correctly pulling in transitive dependencies.\n  `Issue #22 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/22>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Adds ``content`` method to HTTP contexts that does HTML content decoding, fixing\n  an encoding issue only experienced when using Python 3.\n  `Issue #10 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/10>`_\n\n0.7.0\n-----\n\n* Rename ``twitter.common.python`` to ``pex`` and split out from the\n  `twitter/commons <http://github.com/twitter/commons>`_ repo.\n\n0.6.0\n-----\n\n* Change the interpretation of ``-i`` (and of PyPIFetcher's pypi_base)\n  to match pip's ``-i``.  This is useful for compatibility with devpi.\n\n0.5.10\n------\n\n* Ensures that .egg/.whl distributions on disk have their mtime updated\n  even though we no longer overwrite them. This gives them a new time\n  lease against their ttl.\n\n  Without this change, once a distribution aged past the ttl it would\n  never be used again, and builds would re-create the same distributions\n  in tmpdirs over and over again.\n\n0.5.9\n-----\n\n* Fixes an issue where SourceTranslator would overwrite .egg/.whl\n  distributions already on disk.  Instead it should always check to see if\n  a copy already exists and reuse if there.\n\n  This ordinarily should not be a problem but the zipimporter caches\n  metadata by filename instead of stat/sha, so if the underlying contents\n  changed a runtime error would be thrown due to seemingly corrupt zip file\n  offsets. `RB #684 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/684/>`_\n\n0.5.8\n-----\n\n* Adds ``-i/--index`` option to the pex tool.\n\n0.5.7\n-----\n\n* Adds ``twitter.common.python.pex_bootstrap`` ``bootstrap_pex_env`` function in\n  order to initialize a PEX environment from within a python interpreter.\n  (Patch contributed by @kwlzn)\n\n* Adds stdin=,stdout=,stderr= keyword parameters to the ``PEX.run`` function.\n  (Patch from @benjy)\n\n0.5.6\n-----\n\n* The crawler now defaults to not follow links for security reasons.\n  (Before the default behavior was to implicitly ``--follow-links`` for all\n  requirements.) `RB #293 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/293/>`_\n\n0.5.5\n-----\n\n* Improves scrubbing of site-packages from PEX environments.\n  `RB #289 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/289/>`_\n\n0.5.1 - 0.5.4\n-------------\n\n* Silences exceptions reported during interpreter teardown (the exceptions\n  resulting from incorrect atexit handler behavior) introduced by 0.4.3\n  `RB #253 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/253/>`_\n  `RB #249 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/249/>`_\n\n* Adds ``__hash__`` to ``Link`` so that Packages are hashed correctly in\n  ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve``\n\n0.5.0\n-----\n\n* Adds wheel support to ``twitter.common.python``\n  `RB #94 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/94/>`_\n  `RB #154 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/154/>`_\n  `RB #148 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/148/>`_\n\n0.4.3\n-----\n\n* Adds ``twitter.common.python.finders`` which are additional finders for\n  setuptools including:\n  - find eggs within a .zip\n  - find wheels within a directory\n  - find wheels within a .zip\n  `RB #86 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/86/>`_\n\n* Adds a new Package abstraction by refactoring Link into Link and Package.\n  `RB #92 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/92/>`_\n\n* Adds support for PEP425 tagging necessary for wheel support.\n  `RB #87 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/87/>`_\n\n* Improves python environment isolation by correctly scrubbing namespace\n  packages injected into module ``__path__`` attributes by nspkg pth files.\n  `RB #116 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/116/>`_\n\n* Adds ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve`` method that handles\n  transitive dependency resolution better.  This means that if the\n  requirement ``futures==2.1.2`` and an unqualified ``futures>=2`` is pulled in\n  transitively, our resolver will correctly resolve futures 2.1.2 instead\n  of reporting a VersionConflict if any version newer than 2.1.2 is\n  available. `RB #129 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/129/>`_\n\n* Factors all ``twitter.common.python`` test helpers into\n  ``twitter.common.python.testing``\n  `RB #91 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/91/>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Fix ``OrderedSet`` atexit exceptions\n  `RB #147 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/147/>`_\n\n* Bug fix: Fix cross-device symlinking (patch from @benjy)\n\n* Bug fix: Raise a ``RuntimeError`` if we fail to write ``pkg_resources`` into a .pex\n  `RB #115 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/115/>`_\n\n0.4.2\n-----\n\n* Upgrade to ``setuptools>=1``\n\n0.4.1\n-----\n\n* ``twitter.common.python`` is no longer a namespace package\n\n0.4.0\n-----\n\n* Kill the egg distiller.  We now delegate .egg generation to bdist_egg.\n  `RB #55 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/55/>`_\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n\n* Short-circuit resolving a distribution if a local exact match is found.\n  `RB #47 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/47/>`_\n\n* Correctly patch the global ``pkg_resources`` ``WorkingSet`` for the lifetime\n  of the Python interpreter. `RB #52 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/52/>`_\n\n* Fixes a performance regression in setuptools ``build_zipmanifest``\n  `Setuptools Issue #154 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/154/build_zipmanifest-results-should-be>`_\n  `RB #53 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/53/>`_\n\n0.3.0\n-----\n\n* Plumb through the ``--zip-safe``, ``--always-write-cache``, ``--ignore-errors``\n  and ``--inherit-path`` flags to the pex tool.\n\n* Delete the unused ``PythonDirWrapper`` code.\n\n* Split ``PEXEnvironment`` resolution into ``twitter.common.python.environment``\n  and deconflate ``WorkingSet``/``Environment`` state.\n\n* Removes the monkeypatched zipimporter in favor of keeping all eggs\n  unzipped within PEX files.  Refactors the PEX dependency cache in\n  ``util.py``\n\n* Adds interpreter detection for Jython and PyPy.\n\n* Dependency translation errors should be made uniform.\n  (Patch from @johnsirois)\n\n* Adds ``PEX_PROFILE_ENTRIES`` to limit the number of entries reported when\n  ``PEX_PROFILE`` is enabled. (Patch from @rgs_)\n\n* Bug fix: Several fixes to error handling in ``twitter.common.python.http``\n  (From Marc Abramowitz)\n\n* Bug fix: PEX should not always assume that ``$PATH`` was available.\n  (Patch from @jamesbroadhead)\n\n* Bug fix: Filename should be part of the .pex cache key or else multiple\n  identical versions will incorrectly resolve (Patch from @tc)\n\n* Bug fix: Executed entry points shouldn't be forced to run in an\n  environment with ``__future__`` imports enabled. (Patch from\n  @lawson_patrick)\n\n* Bug fix: Detect versionless egg links and fail fast. (Patch from\n  @johnsirois.)\n\n* Bug fix: Handle setuptools>=2.1 correctly in the zipimport monkeypatch\n  (Patch from @johnsirois.)\n\n0.2.3\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Fix handling of Fetchers with ``file://`` urls.\n\n0.2.2\n-----\n\n* Adds the pex tool as a standalone tool.\n\n0.2.1\n-----\n\n* Bug fix: Bootstrapped ``twitter.common.python`` should declare ``twitter.common``\n  as a namespace package.\n\n0.2.0\n-----\n\n* Make ``twitter.common.python`` fully standalone by consolidating\n  external dependencies within ``twitter.common.python.common``.\n\n0.1.0\n-----\n\n* Initial published version of ``twitter.common.python``.\n\n\n",
