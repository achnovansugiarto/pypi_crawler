    "description": "# Playbook\n\n[![PyPI Version][pypi-image]][pypi-url]\n[![Build Status][build-image]][build-url]\n[![Code Coverage][coverage-image]][coverage-url]\n\n> Define workflows as Playbooks and combine manual work tasks with automation.\n\n\n`pip3 install playbook`\n\nDefine your own Playbook in a class extending from `Playbook`.\n\nEvery method that\ndoesn't begin with an underscore is read in as a step to be completed, in order.\nThe step name will be built from the method name, and the description is taken\neither from the method's own docstring or from any data returned from invoking\nthe method.\n\nEvery Step can have attributes:\n\n        * `repeatable` – step can be repeated when resuming or re-running playbook\n        * `skippable` – step can be skipped by answering no, no justification needed\n        * `critical` – step cannot be skipped and must be confirmed\n        * `name` – alternative title for the step\n\n```python\nfrom playbook import Playbook\n\n\nclass CustomPlaybook(Playbook):\n\n    def first_step(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Do ABC now.\n        \"\"\"\n    def second_step(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Do EFG then wait 1 hour.\n        \"\"\"\n    def third_step(self):\n        task = \"reboot\"\n        return f\"perform a {task}\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def last_step():\n        \"\"\"Everything ok?\"\"\"\n```\n\nEvery `Playbook` object comes with a default main method that you can use to execute the script.\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    CustomPlaybook.main()\n```\n\nThe run-book object can also be instantiated and run directly.\n\n```python\nbook = CustomPlaybook(file_path=\"path/to/file\")\nbook.run()\n```\n\n**You should avoid using the step names `run` and `main`**, which are already defined. If you need to override these\nmethods to define custom behavior then that is fine.\n\n## Re-run\nAs steps are completed, the results are written out to a log file. You can set a custom log file path by passing\nan argument to main, as in:\n\n```\npython3 my_playbook.py output.log\n```\n\nWhen reusing the same log file, already completed steps will be skipped. Any new steps found in the `Playbook`\nand not already in the log will be processed as normal, with results appended to the end of the file.\n\n\n## Previous Work\nInspired by [this blog post](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation)\nby Dan Slimmon and [runbook](https://github.com/UnquietCode/runbook.py).\n\n\n## Changelog\n[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\n### License\nLicensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 (ASL 2.0).\n\n\n<!-- Badges -->\n\n[pypi-image]: https://badge.fury.io/py/playbook.svg\n[pypi-url]: https://pypi.org/project/playbook/\n[build-image]: https://github.com/sysid/playbook/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg\n[build-url]: https://github.com/sysid/playbook/actions/workflows/build.yml\n[coverage-image]: https://codecov.io/gh/sysid/playbook/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n[coverage-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/sysid/playbook\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.
