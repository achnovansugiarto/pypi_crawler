This example does not use Simulink, and instead uses a very simple PLC script, which variables end up in the ADS pool. \n\n## Your own custom GUI\n\nTwinPy is designed as a library. So your own application should incorporate it instead of modifying it.\n\nTo customize a GUI for your application, you can extend the `BaseGUI` or `TcMainWindow` class with your own. To maintain clean version control, create your own repository and load this base repo as a git submodule.\n\n### Starting your own GUI\n\nA repository has been cloned or initialized.\n\n 1. Add TwinPy as a submodule by running:\n       * `git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/ctw-bw/twinpy.git`\n 2. Create and activate a virtual environment if none exists yet:\n       * `python -m venv venv`\n       * `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n 3. Now install the TwinPy submodule in the virtual environment:\n       * `pip install -e twinpy`\n            * This will create a link from the TwinPy source, so it is available everywhere (inside that venv)\n 4. To install other dependencies, copy `./twinpy/requirements.txt` to `./requirements.txt` and run\n       * `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n 5. Now create your own application, extending `twinpy.ui.BaseGUI` or `twinpy.ui.TcMainWindow`\n     * You can also copy the source of `BaseGUI` and `__main__.py` to your own application to get you started.\n\n## Install package\n\nInstall TwinPy via pip:\n\n```pip install twinpy```\n\n### From source\n\nAfter cloning this repository (stand-alone or as a submodule), run the following in a command window (from the virtual environment):\n\n```\npip install -e ./twinpy\n```\n\nThis will install the package from local source. The `-e` flag keeps the original source editable, which is convenient during development.\n\nIt is recommended to install a local package like twinpy only in a virtual environment. \n\n## Getting started\n\nThis explains how to run the given TwinPy example with the WE2 Simulink models. This is not applicable to a custom GUI or custom models. Use this getting-started as a check to see if your system is ready.\n\n 1. To run from a virtual environment (recommended), open a terminal in this directory and run: `python -m venv venv` (use a full path to select a different Python version). A virtual environment is now created.\n 2. Run `venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` for PowerShell or `venv/Scripts/activate.bat` for CMD. Your terminal should now show a '(venv)' prefix, the environment has been activated.\n 4. Install the regular packages with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n 5. You can now run `python -m twinpy`\n\nIn case you do not want to use a virtual environment, just skip steps 1 and 2.\n\n## Run with active terminal\n\nBy default `app.exec()` is a hanging command that fires up the main event loop of the GUI. It will prevent the script from exiting when the application is still open. When running the GUI from a terminal, you cannot interact with the active objects untill the GUI was closed.\n\nPyzo has a way around this. If you run the script from a shell with 'gui' set to \"PyQt5\" you can disable the `app.exec()` line. The interpreter will handle the QT event loop elsewhere, freeing up the Python console for you to use.\n\n## TwinCAT Interface\n\nInterfacing with TwinCAT starts with the SimulinkModel object. It points to a Simulink object running in TwinCAT. You can address parts of the model in a hierarchical way, based on the hierarchy in the original Simulink model:\n\n```\nmodel = SimulinkModel(...)\nconst_block = model.MySubSystem.OtherSubSystem.MyConstBlock\n```\n\nParameters are listed as properties of blocks. Use `get()` and `set()` to read and write those parameters:\n\n```\nval = model.MySubSystem.OtherSubSystem.MyConstBlock.Value.get()\n# A Constant block only has one parameter, named `Value`\n```\n\nIf a block only has a single parameter or signal, you can also use `get()` and `set()` directly on the block:\n\n```\nval = model.MySubSystem.OtherSubSystem.MyConstBlock.get()  # Same result as above\n```\n\nSignals are named `si{n}` and `so{n}` for input and output signals, numbered in the order determined by Simulink. Parameters are named after their Simulink name.\n\n## Docs ##\n\nDocumentation from the source can be compiled using sphinx:\n\n```\ncd docs\nmake html\n```\n\nNote: if you get an error about e.g. missing the pyads package because you use a virtual environment, install sphinx inside the virtual environment too. \n\nDocumentation is automatically built and hosted on readthedocs.io: https://twinpy.readthedocs.io\n\n## Tests ##\n\nSee the `tests/` directory for unit tests and some run scripts. The tests are made with the `unittest` framework. Run all tests with:\n\n```shell\npython -m unittest\n```\n\nSome tests rely on the pyads test server. This test server unfortunately does not work with Windows. When on a Windows system, use Linux subsystem for Windows, a virtual machine or Docker. Look for the pyads documentation or the [pyads Contributing.md](https://github.com/stlehmann/pyads/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) for more info.\n\n### PyQt ###\n\nWhen running the tests without an actual screen (like SSH terminal or in a pipeline) PyQt will throw a fatal error. The widgets cannot be created without a screen. There a couple of workarounds for this:\n\n * Include the Qt option `-platform minimal` option: run `python -m unittest -platform minimal`\n * Set a debug environment variable: `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`\n * Use a virtual X server: `xvfb-run python -m unittest`\n\n\n",
