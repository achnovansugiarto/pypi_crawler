Both at my work and on many public Wi-Fi networks, UDP traffic is blocked and the only way I can access the aforementioned subnets is by using OpenVPN.\n\nLet me show you an explanatory diagram of my personal network:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fernandoenzo/wireguard-subnets/master/assets/network-diagram.svg\">\n\nLet's also take a look at the server routing table:\n\n```commandline\n10.0.0.0/24 dev wg0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.1 metric 1000\n10.1.0.0/24 dev tun0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.0.1 metric 1000\n192.168.1.0/24 dev wg0 scope link metric 1000\n192.168.1.0/24 via 10.1.0.1 dev tun0 metric 2000\n```\n\nIt is also important to know that we have the following iptables rules added on the Home machine:\n\n```commandline\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.1.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n```\n\nTherefore, under normal conditions, all VPN computers that do not belong to the Residential Private Network are able to connect to computers that do belong to it, using the Home computer as a\ngateway. And by default this connection is made through the WireGuard tunnel, as it has a lower metric in the VPN server's routing table.\n\nNow let's suppose that the Home computer loses the WireGuard connection to the server for whatever reason.\n\n- **What will happen then if we try to connect to a Residential Private Network computer from outside?**\n    - We won't. It's impossible to reach those computers.\n- **Why?**\n    - Because of the server metrics, which will keep trying to redirect that connection through the WireGuard tunnel, even when that connection to the Home computer is down.\n- **How can we fix it so that the connection can still flow, but through the OpenVPN tunnel?**\n    - By removing the entry `192.168.1.0/24 dev wg0 scope link metric 1000` from the routing table and adding it back later if the WireGuard connection to the Home computer is reestablished.\n\nSo that is exactly what this program does. It automatically adds and removes routes to the server's routing table to avoid blocking traffic to these internal networks if the WireGuard tunnel to\nour gateway computer fails.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe program has very few options to keep it simple, so let's see a couple of examples.\n\nLet's continue with the previous example. We have the network `192.168.1.0/24` behind Home, with WireGuard IP `10.0.0.2`, and we want to check every 30 seconds (default is 20 seconds) if Home's\n`wg` interface is still up. If the program needs to add the network to the routing table, we want it to have a metric of 1000.\n\n```commandline\nsudo wireguard-subnets -i wg0 -p 30 -m 1000 10.0.0.2:192.168.1.0/24\n```\n\nLet's suppose now that we have a totally different network architecture, in which subnets `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24` are reachable behind IP `10.0.0.5` and subnet `172.16.0.0/16` is \nbehind IP `10.0.0.8`:\n\n```commandline\nsudo wireguard-subnets -i wg0 10.0.0.5:192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24 10.0.0.8:172.16.0.0/16\n```\n\nThe program can be cleanly stopped by a SIGINT (2) signal (Control+C) or a SIGTERM (15) signal (such as those sent by `systemctl stop` or `kill` commands).\n\nThere is also a `--help/-h` option in the program. Don't forget to read it if you forget something:\n\n```commandline\nsudo wireguard-subnets -h\n```\n\n### With systemd\n\nIt's strongly advised to manage this program using the provided systemd service template in this repository.\n\nYou just need to copy the file called `wireguard-subnets.service` to your `/etc/systemd/system` folder and run the following commands:\n\n```commandline\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl start wireguard-subnets.service\n```\n\nTo make the service to start at system boot, execute:\n\n```commandline\nsudo systemctl enable wireguard-subnets.service\n```\n\nTo watch the program progress:\n\n```commandline\nsudo journalctl -u wireguard-subnets.service -f\n```\n\n## Packaging\n\nIn this section we are going to explain how to replicate the packaging process.\n\n### Autopackage\n\nTo generate the program lightest portable version, which is available in this GitHub repository, install first `autopackage` with `pip`:\n\n```commandline\npip install autopackage\n```\n\nThen run the following commands:\n\n```commandline\nautopackage -s setup.py -p\n```\n\n### PyInstaller\n\nTo generate the program heaviest portable version, which is also available in this GitHub repository, install `pyinstaller` with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install pyinstaller\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```\npyinstaller --onefile --bootloader-ignore-signals __main__.py\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.
