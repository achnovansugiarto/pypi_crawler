    "description": "![](images/timerdo.png)\n\nTimerdo is a CLI app that manages a minimalist to-do list with built-in timer \nto track your work and keep you productive.\n\nIf you are interested about how Timerdo is built you can go  directly [here](https://github.com/caiomts/timerdo#about)\n\n# Installation\n\n![](images/pip_install.png)\n\nTimerdo is 100% python, so pip installation should work regardless of your OS. \n\n*You may have to put it in the PATH to call it directly with the `timerdo` command.* \n\n# Quick Start\n\n**Timerdo was thought to track tasks, so tasks are its building blocks. \nKeep that in mind.** \n\n**Done is Done. You can't do anything else with a task once it's done.**\n\n## Add task\nSo, let's add your first:\n\n![](images/add_1.png)\n\nTask is a required argument, but you have some options. Let's take a look on it:\n\n![](images/add_help.png)\n\nSo, you can also define a project to the task, but remember, \ntasks are the building blocks, so there is no project without a task!\n\nIn addition, you can set a due date for your task and a tag.\n\nThe reminder has a special feature. \nIt will appear in your to-do list only after the defined day. \nThis is for the type of task that you have to do at a specific time or can just remember later.  \n\nFinally, you can change the default status, but keep in mind. Done is Done.\nYou can visualize what was done, but that's it.\n\n## Start the timer\n\nNow that you already have a task, let's keep track of the time you spend on it.\n\n![](images/start_1.png)\n\nTo start tracking the task ID is a required argument, \nI'll show you in a bit how to get to know the task IDs, but first let's take a look at the help.\n\n![](images/start_help.png)\n\nNice, you can also set a *timebox* with the `--duration` flag! If you do so,\nTimerdo keeps running and a message will pop up when you are done.\n\nBut How do I know my task IDs?!\n\n## View\n\nThe Timerdo workflow was thought to keep things simple, so you add your tasks and\nwhenever you need to see your to-do list at the end of a task or at the start of your day\nyou simply call the view.\n\n![](images/view.png)\n\nThis is the structure of the view, but Timerdo will only show you heads that\nyou have at least one task.\n\nLet's see the help.\n\n![](images/view_help.png)\n\nYou can set the date until when it shows the tasks with due dates. The default is\none week ahead.\n\n## Stop\n\nNow, how do we stop the timer?\n\n![](images/stop_1.png)\n\nTimerdo keeps track of task status! So, whenever you start a task, if the status\nis `to do`, Timerdo automatically changes it to `doing` and whenever you stop the timer\nit asks you if you have finished the task. Cool, right?\n\n*Timerdo don't let you work on a done task as well ;)*\n\nAs always, let's look at the help:\n\n![](images/stop_help.png)\n\nYou can also add a note to keep track of something important.\nIf you start a timer as a *timebox* this option will also be asked by the prompt.\n\nNow you know how to use the main features, and this is almost everything\nyou need to use Timerdo. \n\nBut let's say you are interested in seeing all tasks you\nhave on your to-do list, regardless of context. Or you are interested in seeing\nall tasks in the same project... \n\n# More features\n\nFirst let's take a look at the general help. First things first, you can install\ncompletion ;).\n\n![](images/help.png)\n\nWe've already covered the following commands: `add`, `start`, `view` and `stop`.\nBut Timerdo also has `edit` and `report`. Actually, both are separate modules with\nanother set of commands.\n\n## Report\n\n![](images/report.png)\n\nThe report module has four commands.\n\n### Log\n\nThe `log` command will just print your to-do list with all your tasks regardless of the state. This command has only one\noption `--init` that restricts printed tasks by the day they entered the list. The default is four weeks before the call.\n\n### Projects\n\n`Projects` has more functionalities, and we can refresh some conceptual points.\n\nWe already know tasks are Timerdo building blocks, so the concept of project is an abstraction\nwhereby, we can bunch a lot of tasks simply giving them the same project name.\n\nThis design has some important implications. One of the most important is: You can't\nadd new tasks with the same project name if all old tasks with this same name were done.\nAs there is nothing to be done with a done task, there is no ongoing project with no tasks to be done.\n\n![](images/projects_help.png)\n\nCalling `project` command with no flag, brings up a list of all tasks sorted by \nproject name, and you will have the information of how much time you've spent in each\nproject (or in a group of tasks you bunched together).\n\n![](images/projects.png)\n\nThis command has also three options, the first one (`--init`) has a default that \nrestricts the projects to show up if at least one of the task in the project was not initiated after the given date.\n\nThe second option (`--project`) allows you to define which projects should be displayed. \nTimerdo also allows you to define more than one project (see below).\n\n![](images/select_project.png)\n\nFinally, the final option (`--done`) is a flag to also see done tasks in projects.\n\n### Tags\n\n`tags` command has almost the same structure as `projects`, with the same options.\nThe only difference is that it does not display how much time was spent per tag. \nTag has no special feature, so you can use it as you want.\n\n### Task\nThe prom queen! `Task` command has only one required argument with no options.\n\n![](images/task_help.png)\n\nHere is the only place where you can see all information about a given task.\nTimerdo will also display another table with all the timers you have for that given\ntask. Cool right?\n\n![](images/task.png)\n\nBut what if I do something wrong?! This is where the last module comes in.\n\n## Edit\n\n`Edit` is where you can - you probably already guessed - edit your records.\n\nIt's not a good place to be, so Timerdo will display raw records and ask for confirmations every time\nyou call a command. \n\n**If you delete our modify something, everything related to it will be lost. Be aware.**\n\n![](images/edit_help.png)\n\nThe module has four commands, where you can delete or edit tasks and where you can\nrely on the project name as a glue to delete all tasks with the same project name at once.\n\nBoth `del-task` and `del-project` have only one required argument - `id` or `project`. \n\n`project` command has two required arguments: the name of the project and the new name.\nIt will just change the project name in all tasks with the same project name.\n\n`task` command works like `add` command but the first argument is the id of the task\nyou are trying to modify.\n\n\n# About\n\nTimerdo is a side project and was born out of my personal necessity. I'd been using [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson) \nfor a while and it's very handy, but I had to keep a to-do list apart. Currently, Timerdo is\nan app I use daily to maintain my to-do list while I keep track my time.\n\nTimerdo is build in python but strongly rely on [SQLModel](https://github.com/tiangolo/sqlmodel) and [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer). \n[@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) has the best documentations ever, and I'm so grateful!\n\nTimerdo work with a SQLite database and uses [tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate) for all prints.\n\nAll images in this README were created with [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/). \n\n# Release\n\n0.0.1\n\n# License\nTimerdo is released under MIT License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
