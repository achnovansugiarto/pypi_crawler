    "description": "# Welcome to ExpoSeq\r\n\r\nExpoSeq is a powerful pipeline for processing and analyzing FASTQ files from sequencing phage Display panning samples.It utilizes [MiXCR](https://docs.milaboratories.com/mixcr/getting-started/installation/) to align and assemble the data which you can subsequently analyze in multiple plots. The pipeline focuses on analysing the identity between samples but also applies various clustering techniques to analyse the relation between the sequences. Besides, you can add binding data to relate the clusters to affinity.  ![overview](expoSeq_overview.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOpen a virtual environment and type ```pip install ExpoSeq```. Ensure that you have python > 3.11 installed.\r\n\r\nTo get started, please download and follow the instructions for MiXCR under the following link: https://docs.milaboratories.com/mixcr/getting-started/installation/ \r\nYou can also only use the test version without installing it.\r\n\r\n## Importing the Plotting Tool\r\n\r\nTo access the plotting tool, you will need to import it into your console by running the following command:\r\n```from ExpoSeq.pipeline import PlotManager```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the fast and easy version you can ignore the rest of the instructions and just import in your Console:\r\n```import ExpoSeq.run```\r\n## Using the PlotManager\r\n\r\nThe PlotManager is the main interface for creating various plots using your FASTQ data. You can create an instance of the PlotManager by running the following command:\r\n```plot = PlotManager()```\r\nTo use the PlotManager to create plots, you will need to upload your FASTQ data to the pipeline. This will automatically happen as soon as you have called the PlotManager. In the following you can obtain an insight in the worklow of the pipeline after the initial call. There, the blue boxes indicate your input, gray are optional inputs while black and red are processing steps and output, respectively.\r\n![relative_path_to_image](workflow_ExpoSeq.png)\r\nIf you just want to test the pipeline and see its functions you can call: ```plot = PlotManager(test_version = True)```\r\n\r\nOnce you have called the test version or have finished the data processing, you can use the PlotManager to create a variety of plots, such as an identity plot based on the jaccard similarity. Here is an example of how to create this type of plot:\r\n```plot.jaccard()```\r\nIf you want to change the style of the plot you can use the PlotManager. If you called it ```plot``` you can do for instance the following: ```plot.style.title_xaxis(\"your_title\")``` \r\nIf you want to implement further plot change you can also refer to the matplotlib.pyplot library and change it in the same way as following:\r\n```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt```\r\n```plt.xlabel(\"your_title\")```\r\nIf you would like to have details about the inputs and functions of the PlotManager call: ```help(plot)``` . You can also call ```help(plot.jaccard)```\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n[1] Dmitriy A. Bolotin, Stanislav Poslavsky, Igor Mitrophanov, Mikhail Shugay, Ilgar Z. Mamedov, Ekaterina V.
