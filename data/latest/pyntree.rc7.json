Not only that, it also lets you save in multiple formats, and even serialize and compress data by merely changing a few characters.\n\n## Installing\n`pip install pyntree`\n\n## Example usage\n```python\nfrom pyntree import Node\ndb = Node(\"your_new_db.pyn\")\ndb.hello = \"world\"\ndb.hello()\n# Output: \"world\"\ndb.save()\n```\n#### 1-liner for saving existing data\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom pyntree import Node\ndata = {'right_now': dt.now()}  # Some sample data\nNode(data).save('file.pyn')  # 1-liner to save your data to a file!\n```\n\n## Features\npyntree is capable of handling the following files, functions, and formats:\n- Dictionaries in plain text\n- Pickled files/serialization\n- JSON files\n- Encryption\n- Backwards compatibility with files saved by pyndb (except encrypted files)\n- Compression in many popular formats\n- Autosaving & saving on close (when garbage collected)\n- ...and more!\n\n## Docs\nThe documentation is available at https://pen.jvadair.com/books/pyntree\n\n## Project board\nTo view, visit https://board.jvadair.com and use credentials:\n- Username: public\n- Password: public\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and start a pull request. I will manually review/test them before implementing.
