    "description": "=======================================\nDesire2Learn Utility Library for Python\n=======================================\n\nThis utility library divides functionality into a pair of modules:\n\n**Data**. The :py:mod:`d2lvalence-util.data` module provides classes to encapsulate\nthe JSON data structures passed back and forth through the Valence APIs. All the\nclasses inherit from a :py:class:`D2LStructure generic base class\n<d2lvalence.data.D2LStructure>`.\n\nNote that currently we drive additions to the `data` module by the needs of our\nsamples and ongoing testing: it does not cover all the structures present in the\nValence API.\n\n**Service**. The :py:mod:`d2lvalence-util.service` module contains a suite of helper\nfunctions you can use to make Valence API calls and partially digest the data\nresults passed back. In general, the data passed back by a service function is\neither a pre-defined class inheriting from :py:class:`D2LStructure\n<d2lvalence.data.D2LStructure>`, or one or more dictionaries formed from the\nretrieved JSON data.\n\nYou can find the \n`latest build <http://code.google.com/p/desire2learn-valence/downloads/list?q=label:pythonlatestutils>`_\nof the utils library on our repository download page.\n\n**Dependencies**. In order to use the Python client utils package, you'll need to\nfirst ensure you have a working Python development environment:\n\n* Python 3 (the reference environment uses Python 3.3).\n\n* The `D2LValence client SDK <http://code.google.com/p/desire2learn-valence/downloads/list?q=label:pythonlatestclient>`_.\n\n* The `Requests Python package <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html>`_\n  gets used in our :py:mod:`service <d2lvalence-util.service>` module to make the\n  calls through to the back-end service, and in our :py:mod:`auth <d2lvalence.auth>`\n  module so that you can use a calling user context object as an authentication\n  helper for Requests.\n\n* The `Bottle Python package <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/>`_ if you want to\n  use the samples available in conjunction with this client library (not a\n  dependency for the client library itself).\n\n\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n0.1.16()\n++++++++\n* Split out d2lvalence.auth into d2lvalence package, and repackage data and\n  service modules into d2lvalence-util package.\n\n\n0.1.15 (2013-05-22)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* added structures and routes for support user activation\n\n* repair news item attachment upload (in create_news_item_for_orgunit) to avoid\n  tacking on extra CR-LF pairs to file data\n\n* broad change to the way dictionaries of control values get passed down from\n  the `service` into the requests library, for two reasons: to attempt to\n  simplify the code around setting them, and to attempt to better avoid stomping\n  values passed down from higher calling layers\n\n* provide a `data.D2LDebugInfo` to act as a carrier for the actual\n  request/response object used in the bowels of a service function call: passing\n  down a `D2LDebugInfo` in a `d2ldebug` keyword argument captures a ref of the\n  request/response used so that you can inspect it after making the service call\n  (for examining outgoing URL/headers, full response headers/body/reason, etc)\n\n* factor `Response.raise_for_status()` call into the `_fetch_content()` private\n  service method to put it in one place, and to allow us the opportunity to\n  gather the response object into a provided `D2LDebugInfo` before possibly\n  raising the exception for a failed call\n\n* added `with_traceback()` to the various exceptions service libarary raises for\n  more provided trace info on exceptions\n\n* added more type checking around parameters passed into service functions that\n  are expected to be D2LValence data classes\n\n* repaired post to create a discussion post to account for being able to send\n  one or more file attachments along with the new post; added\n  `data.D2LDiscussionPostAttachment` child of `data.D2LFile` to handle\n  discussion post attachments\n\n* repaired `service.check_versions()` to consume an array of\n  SupportedVersionRequest objects\n\n* fixed bug in `data.CreateCourseOffering.fashion_CreateCourseOffering` factory\n  function to set `Path` property for the new instance\n\n* added service function to retrieve a raw news item attachment for a news item\n  in an org unit\n\n* added structures and routes to support ePortfolio package export and import\n\n0.1.14 (2013-04-29)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* repaired D2LUserContext so that it (a) handles API routes that contain\n  characters that would URL-escaped in both it's AuthBase implementation *and*\n  its :func:`create_authenticated_url` method, and (b) does this handling in the\n  same way that does D2L authentication on other language platforms.\n\n0.1.13 (2013-04-17)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* enhanced `service` functions to allow for passing keyword args down into the\n  requests library making the outgoing HTTP calls\n\n* explicitly added 'application/json' content type header to service actions\n  sending JSON to the service\n\n* modified multipart/mixed upload functions in `service` module to cope with\n  changes in requests v1.2.0 around setting the Content-Type header for the\n  upload action: now the functions use sessions around a prepped-request object,\n  consistent with requests library new pattern for messing with the headers/body\n  of an HTTP request\n\n* added `data.D2LNewsAttachment` child of `data.D2LFile` to handle adding\n  attachments to news events; added `data.NewsItemData` structure to support\n  creation of news events; added new routes to support more news actions\n\n* added `data.CreateEnrollmentData` structure to handle structure sent during\n  enrollment creation; added service routes around user enrollment (delete,\n  create)\n\n* added `data.GroupCategoryDataFetch` and service methods to support some group\n  routes; added routes around group org units\n\n* added `data.GradeObjectCreateData` and re-factored `data.GradeObject`, as well\n  as the derived grade object type classes, to separate structures for fetching\n  and creating grade objects; added `data.GradeObjectCategory` and\n  `data.GradeObjectCategoryData` to support grade object category routes; added\n  service routes around grade objects, grade categories, grade values\n\n\n* added factory methods to the incoming-grade-value structures for easier\n  creation; added `data.IncomingFinalAdjustedGradeValue` structure for updating\n  final adjusted grade value\n\n* added data structures and routes around course completion\n\n* added routes around calendar events\n\n* fixed `service.get_organization_info` to return an Organization JSON\n  structure, and not raw request content.\n\n* fixed `service.get_all_my_grade_values_for_org` to return grade value\n  instances, instead of grade object instances\n\n0.1.12 (2013-01-23)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* fixed bug in D2LUserContext's implementation as a requests.auth.AuthBase so\n  that it more properly handles API routes that contain characters that would be\n  URL escaped by the requests library\n\n0.1.11 (2013-01-04)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* revised `auth.D2LAppContext.create_url_for_authentication` to include an\n  `encrypt_request` parameter (true by default) to allow generation of\n  for-authentication URLs that do not use HTTPS\n\n* added `data.D2LDropboxSubsmission` and several service functions to fill out\n  support for the dropbox routes\n\n* fixed parm name in get dropbox folder route\n\n* fixed the `ExternalEmail` properties for `data.CreateUserData` and\n  `data.UpdateUserData` to provide better support for having `None` values\n  (which will translate to `null` when serialized to JSON)\n\n* added `service.update_user()` for updating user records\n\n* fixed the `RoleId` property for `data.CreateUserData` to have an empty default\n  value rather than a numeric default (which probably isn't a useful default for\n  anyone)\n\n* added `data.UserPasswordData` and service methods to support the user password\n  routes (deleting, changing, resetting)\n\n* added `data.Organization` and `data.OrgUnit` and service methods to support\n  routes that query the org structure\n\n* added `data.EnrollmentData` and service functions to fill out support for\n  enrollment routes\n\n* added `data.IncomingGradeValue` and its derived classes, and service functions\n  to fill out support for grades routes\n\n* added `data.NewsItem` and several service functions to fill out support for\n  the news routes\n\n* added support to `service` module to try and support pre-1.0.0 requests\n  package as well as post-1.0.0 versions.\n\n0.1.10 (2012-12-18)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n* revised `data` and `service` modules to update for compatibility with requests\n  package post version 1.0.0\n\n0.1.9 (2012-10-15)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* added data and service functions for Learning Repostory routes\n\n* added data and service functions for course offering and content routes\n\n* added data and service functions for discussion forum routes\n* renamed utility functions in `data` module used for property set/getting to\n  suggest they should be internal and not directly used\n\n* added default (empty) value for `DescriptorDict` property to the\n  `data.D2LLockerFile` class\n\n* added `files` named parameter to post and put utility methods for simple file\n  post/puts\n\n* fix `service.rename_group_locker_folder()` to properly form route\n\n* cleanup service module to python-ify parameter names\n\n0.1.8 (2012-08-30)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* added support to the `auth` module for building an anonymous user context\n  (context with no user ID/Key pair) -- clients can use such a context to make\n  calls to the various API Property/Version routes to query LMS for API versions\n\n* moved auth to use direct `==` comparison to check for empty parameters instead\n  of use `in (singleItemList,)` pattern\n\n* factored out process of fetching contents of Requests objects into a single\n  funtion, moved to examine `request.headers['content.type']` to determine how\n  to handle contents rather than just `try` to fetch r.JSON and default to\n  r.content\n\n* repaired `service.check_versions()` to pass the `supported_version_request_array`\n  as json data\n\n* fixed `service._simple_upload()` to seek underlying buffer stream to head\n  position before and after read, instead of trying to seek on the byte-string\n  we read the stream into\n\n* added support to the `service` library for distinguishing between anonymous and\n  non-anonymous user contexts, and let version calls be made with anonymous\n  contexts, raise errors in the case of all other calls that demand a user context\n\n* added more grade routes for fetching 'my' grades\n\n0.1.7 (2012-08-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* added `service.get_profile_by_user_id()`\n\n* added `data.LockerItem`, `data.LockerFolder`, `data.GroupLocker` to support\n  locker operations\n\n* added to suite of locker functions to the `service` module to assist with locker\n  operations: this includes an example of how you might want to handle the\n  \"simple upload\" process for those Valence routes that use simple file upload\n\n0.1.6 (2012-07-13)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* Fix bug in `update_social_media_url_by_url()`... we should look\n  for 'url'-keyed entries, not 'name'-keyed entries\n\n* Some documentation revisions\n\n* Remove 'exceptions' module as not utilized\n\n0.1.5 (2012-07-11)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* Changed `D2LStructure.as_json()` to kick back a deep-copy of the encapsulated\n  data, instead of a ref to the instance's internal data structure\n\n* Bug fixes\n\n0.1.4 (2012-07-06)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* Refactoring and re-building of the libraries: moved data-structures into\n  `data` module and service-related functions into `service` module;\n  auth-related functionality remains in `auth`\n\n* Re-worked samples to be more in line with design for the other client\n  libraries\n\n0.1.0 (2012-06-02)\n++++++++++++++++++\n* Initial version",
