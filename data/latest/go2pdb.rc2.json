    "description": "# Retrieve PDB entries annotated with specific GO codes\n\nThis code retrieves [Protein DataBank](https://www.rcsb.org/) protein structure entries for proteins that have been annotated in [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) with specific [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) codes.\nThis is useful for performing structural bioinformatics analyses (e.g., electrostatics comparisons, etc.) across proteins with similar functions.\n\nThis code also uses the [Gene Ontology Annotation database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/) for enhanced annotation beyond what can be queried from UniProt.\nThis index is updated approximately every 4 weeks and can be [downloaded via FTP](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/PDB/).\nHowever, the database appears to have holes in it, so this code also searches UniProt for entries with matching GO codes that also have PDB structures.\n\n## Support\n\nThis software is supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant GM069702).\n\n## Installation and dependencies\n\nAfter creating and activating a virtual environment (e.g., with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)), you can install the code and most of its dependencies by running\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\nfrom the top of the source directory.\nThe code assumes that you have the docker program available in your path (i.e., can be run from the command line).\n\nMore information about the code use can be obtained by running\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb --help\n```\n\n## Example use\n\nFor more information about any of the commands below, using the `--help` option.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb --help\ngo2pdb search --help\n```\n\n### Finding structures with specific functions\n\nFor example, suppose we wanted to find the structures of all \"nickel-binding proteins\".\nWe will define this set of proteins as those gene products that have the Gene Ontology annotation [GO:0016151 \"nickel cation binding\"](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0016151).\nHowever, if we're not completely sure that this GO code covers all relevant proteins, we can also add a PDB keyword search (e.g., for \"nickel\").\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb search --pdb-keyword NICKEL --search-goa GO:0016151\n```\n\nThe `--search-goa` option adds search results from GOA.\nEven though GOA appears to be incomplete, it provides useful additional information in its results (when present).\n\nBy default, the command above will produce a `search-output.xlsx` file that includes the results of your search.\n\n### Comparing results by sequence similarity and identity\n\nFor most analyses, it is useful to start by grouping structures with similar sequences.\nSequence alignment is performed using the [BLAST Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ncbi/blast).\n\n**NOTE**: To perform this sequence analysis, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (e.g., [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)) installed on your computer.\n\nThe first step is to run BLAST on the existing sequences:\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb blast\n```\n\nThis command consumes the `search-output.xlsx` file from the search step and produces a `blast-output.xlsx` file with pairwise matches between sequences.\nNote that the results are filtered based on similarity and identity cutoffs; run with the `--help` option for more information.\nThe ``blast-output.xlsx` file can be used with graph visualization tools for qualitative insight into the relationships between PDB entries.\n\n### Clustering and summarizing results\n\nRunning\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb cluster\n```\n\nwill cluster sequences based on sequence identity.\nThe metric used for clustering can be changed with the `--cluster-metric` option and the cutoff for clustering can be changed with the `--metric-cutoff` option.\nThis clustering step will produce a simple table in `cluster-output.xlsx` that associates PDB chains with sequence-based clusters.\nThe sequence-based clusters are named by a representative protein in each cluster.\n\nThe cluster information can be merged with the search results by running\n\n```bash\ngo2pdb summarize\n```\n\nwhich will produce a joined table in `summary-output.xlsx`.\n\nThe default behavior for both of these commands can be modified with options described in the `--help` option output.\n\nThe spreadsheet output contains the following columns:\n\nColumns | Description\n------- | -----------\nPDB ID, PDB description, PDB title | Basic information about the structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)\nPDB deposit date | The date the structure was added to the PDB (sort by this for the newest structures)\nPDB method, PDB resolution (A) | Information about the experimental method for determining the structure; sort by resolution for the highest-refined structures\nPDB chain ID, PDB strand ID(s), PDB strand type, PDB strand sequence | Information about a specific strand (subunit) of the protein.  This is the sequence used for BLAST comparisons between proteins.\nPDB keyword match | If a PDB keyword search was performed, this gives the matching keyword (e.g., \"NICKEL\") used for the search.  When this is blank, it means that \"NICKEL\" did not occur in the PDB keywords for this structure.\nUniProt entry ID, UniProt entry name, UniProt protein names | Description of the UniProt entry for this strand.  Often the UniProt description is more informative than the PDB description and the UniProt online entry contains links to many useful tools for analyzing the sequence.  When these fields are blank, it means the structure was not identified from a GO code match (i.e., was found from a PDB keyword search instead).\nUniProt GO code | Matching GO code from search.\nGOA qualifiers, GOA GO code, GOA DB reference, GOA evidence, GOA additional evidence, GOA taxon ID, GOA annotation date, GOA assigned by | If a search of the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database was performed, this provides additional information about how the GO assignment was made.  The GOA database appears to be incomplete so blank entries should not be interpreted as lack of evidence for the GO annotation.\nCluster representative, Cluster description | These are the clusters assigned to each strand based on BLAST sequence identity with a 90% identity threshold.  Sorting by this column is useful for focusing on a specific type of protein.\n\n\n",
