    "description": "# Elden Ring death counter\n\nCaptures screen and detects \"You died\" upon death in the video game Elden Ring (2022)\n\n## Install\n\nRequires Windows and Python 3.7+\n\n### If you know what Python and pip is:\n\nInstall with pip: `pip install youdied`\n\n### If you don't know what Python is:\n\nMake sure you have Python installed on you machine.\n\nGo to your terminal and confirm that python is installed \nby typing `python -V` and press Enter. \nIt should say something like `Python 3.10.4` or something similar. \nIt must be version 3.7.0 or higher.\n\nIf you don't, there are many ways to install Python.\nE.g. using __one of these__ approaches:\n\n - install windows app https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-310/9pjpw5ldxlz5?activetab=pivot:overviewtab (very easy)\n - download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (default)\n - install miniconda from \n   https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (potentially more advanced)\n\nAfter you have installed Python, open you terminal (or anaconda prompt when using miniconda). \nNow, you should verify that you have Python installed, \nwhich also lets you use the `pip`-command to install new packages.\nGo back to the step above and install using the `pip`-command.\n\n__NOTE__: Python is capable of running any arbitrary code on your machine. \nIf you have no idea what strangers' code does, then you should not run it on your \nmachine. \nBe skeptical, and critical.\nYou could ask someone you trust to look over this code first if you're unable to verify yourself.\nThe code is freely available in the repository for scrutiny, inspiration and education.\n  \n## How to use `youdied`\nAfter installed, you can run the `youdied` command from terminal \n(in the same Python environment that you installed this package in). \n\n__*How to stop the program from running?*__ Press Ctrl + Z in the terminal\n\n### Start counting deaths\n\nWhen program is running, it will notify you in the terminal on death detection.\nThere is a 5 second cooldown, to ensure that a death is only counted once.\n\n### Examples\n\nNew character: `youdied <name of character`\n\nContinue from last character: `youdied`\n\nPrint name of last character: `youdied -p` or `youdied --previous`\n\nDeath count file: *&lt;your user folder&gt; / .youdied / deathCounts / &lt;character name&gt;.txt*\n\nShow stats: `youdied -l` or `youdied --list` will output something like\n\n```\n        Started last            Character          Death count\n 2022-04-20 12:00:00       Always Feet 69                    4\n 2022-04-17 12:00:00        Cavelady Dida                    4\n 2022-04-12 12:00:00           Elden Lard                    8\n 2022-04-09 12:00:00      Maidenless Hero                    4\n```\n\n### With words\n\nIn its simples form run `youdied <character name>`, \nfor example `youdied Maidenless Hero` if your want to store death counts \nunder the name \"Maidenless Hero\". \nThe next time, you only have to run the `youdied` command without \nany arguments if you want to use the same character name.\n\nIf you want to register deaths in another name, stop the script (Ctrl + Z) and give a new name.\n\nE.g. `youdied Cavelady Dida`\n\n### Multiple characters?\nSome players have more than one character, \nso therefore death counts are associated with a character name. \nThe name is just a convenience to allow organizing the death counts.\n\n(This name of course has nothing to do with what you call your character in the game.\nIf you wish, you may call them \"character 1\", \"character 2\", \"tarnished Bob\" or whatever you want.)\n\n### Files and output\nWhen running for the first time a folder `<your user folder> / .youdied` will be created.\nThis folder will keep track of death statistics and inspirational message use statistics\n(to increase variety of messages shown)\n\nAdditionally, there is a folder called `<your user folder> / .youdied / deathCount` \nthat holds a file for each registered character. \nE.g. with the four characters used above, there would be a file called \"Always Feet 69.txt\" \nwith content only being the number \"4\".\n\nIf you want to know the death statistics of all characters you have tracked, \nrun `youdied -l` as mentioned above.\n\n### Help\nRun `youdied -h` to get the help screen:\n\n```\nyoudied -h\nusage: youdied [-h] [-v] [-l] [-p] [character_name ...]\n\nA motivational Elden Ring death counter. Uses screen capture to detect deaths. \nWill output motivational quotes and proverbs on detection.\n\npositional arguments:\n  character_name  Name of character to register stats on. If omitted the last used character is used, \n                  if any (default: None)\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help      show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version   Print version and exit. (default: False)\n  -l, --list      List all characters and exit. (default: False)\n  -p, --previous  Print out previous character, i.e. the last one used, and exit. (default: False)\n\nGood luck, Tarnished!\n```\n\n### How to stop the program\n\nPress Ctrl + Z in the terminal\n\n## Credits\n\n### D3DShot\nScreen capturing is possible using Windows Duplication API, \nand we use the fabulous [D3DShot][d3dshot] python package to do so.\nUnfortunately, there is an [issue with version of a dependecy package][d3dshot_issue]\n`pillow`, which is breaks the installation. \nAny further development from the developers of D3DShot seems to be stalling.\nWe have therefore fixed the dependency and embedded their code inside this project because\n[PYPI doesn't allow direct URI dependencies][pypi_uri_deps].\n\n[d3dshot]: https://github.com/SerpentAI/D3DShot\n[d3dshot_issue]: https://github.com/SerpentAI/D3DShot/issues/44\n[pypi_uri_deps]: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6301\n\n\n### The world of amazing nerds\nSo many open source tools and programs. \nLook at all the free (as in beer) code others have shared! \n\nImagine where we would be if they were not there.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
