    "description": "A library to implement a leveling system into a discord bot. One of the most popular discord bots out there is MEE6 and it's leveling system. This library provides ways to easily implement one for yourself. It uses SQLite (aiosqlite) to locally query things such as their XP, rank, and level. Various amounts of other methods and classes are also provided so you can access or remove contents from the database file.\r\n\r\n<!-- ## Installing\r\nYou can install the latest [PyPI version](https://pypi.org/project/discordLevelingSystem/) of the library by doing:\r\n\r\n`$ pip install discordLevelingSystem`\r\n\r\nOr the development version:\r\n\r\n`$ pip install git+https://github.com/Defxult/discordLevelingSystem` -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n![showcase](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655186216060321816/835010159092039680/leveling_showcase.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## How to import\r\n```py\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem, LevelUpAnnouncement, RoleAward\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Intents\r\n[Intents](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intents.html) are required for proper functionality\r\n```py\r\nbot = commands.Bot(..., intents=discord.Intents(messages=True, guilds=True, members=True))\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## DiscordLevelingSystem\r\n```class DiscordLevelingSystem(rate=1, per=60.0, awards=None, **kwargs)```\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Parameters of the DiscordLevelingSystem constructor\r\n* `rate` (`int`) The amount of messages each member can send before the cooldown triggers\r\n* `per` (`float`) The amount of seconds each member has to wait before gaining more XP, aka the cooldown\r\n* `awards` (`Optional[Dict[int, List[RoleAward]]]`) The role given to a member when they reach a `RoleAward` level requirement\r\n---\r\n### Kwargs of the DiscordLevelingSystem constructor\r\n| Name | Type | Default Value | Info\r\n|------|------|---------------|-----\r\n| `no_xp_roles` | `Sequence[int]` | `None` | A sequence of role ID's. Any member with any of those roles will not gain XP when sending messages\r\n| `no_xp_channels` | `Sequence[int]` | `None` | A sequence of text channel ID's. Any member sending messages in any of those text channels will not gain XP\r\n| `announce_level_up` | `bool` | `True` | If `True`, level up messages will be sent when a member levels up\r\n| `stack_awards` | `bool` | `True` | If this is `True`, when the member levels up the assigned role award will be applied. If `False`, the previous role award will be removed and the level up assigned role will also be applied\r\n| `level_up_announcement` | `Union[LevelUpAnnouncement, Sequence[LevelUpAnnouncement]]` | `LevelUpAnnouncement()` | The message that is sent when someone levels up. If this is a sequence of `LevelUpAnnouncement`, one is selected at random\r\n|`bot` | ` Union[AutoShardedBot, Bot]` | `None` | Your bot instance variable. Used only if you'd like to use the `on_dls_level_up` event\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Attributes\r\n* `no_xp_roles`\r\n* `no_xp_channels`\r\n* `announce_level_up`\r\n* `stack_awards`\r\n* `level_up_announcement`\r\n* `bot`\r\n* `rate` (`int`) Read only property from the constructor\r\n* `per` (`float`) Read only property from the constructor\r\n* `database_file_path` (`str`) Read only property\r\n* `active` (`bool`) Enable/disable the leveling system. If `False`, nobody can gain XP when sending messages unless this is set back to `True`\r\n\r\n> NOTE: All attributes can be set during initialization\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\nWhen setting up the leveling system, a database file needs to be created in order for the library to function. \r\n* Associated static method\r\n  * `DiscordLevelingSystem.create_database_file(path: str)`\r\n\r\nThe above static method is used to create the database file for you in the path you specify. This method only needs to be called once. Example:\r\n```py\r\nDiscordLevelingSystem.create_database_file(r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Documents')\r\n```\r\nOnce created, there is no need to ever run that method again unless you want to create a new database file from scratch. Now that you have the database file, you can use the leveling system.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Connecting to the Database\r\n* Associated method\r\n  * `DiscordLevelingSystem.connect_to_database_file(path: str)`\r\n\r\nSince the database file has already been created, all you need to do is connect to it. \r\n> NOTE: When connecting to the database file, the event loop must not be running\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom discord.ext import commands\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem\r\n\r\nbot = commands.Bot(...)\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem()\r\nlvl.connect_to_database_file(r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Documents\\DiscordLevelingSystem.db')\r\n\r\nbot.run(...)\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## RoleAward\r\n```class RoleAward(role_id: int, level_requirement: int, role_name=None)```\r\n\r\nYou can assign roles to the system so when someone levels up to a certain level, they are given that role. `RoleAward` is how that is accomplished.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Parameters of the RoleAward constructor\r\n* `role_id` (`int`) ID of the role that is to be awarded.\r\n* `level_requirement` (`int`) What level is required for a member to be awarded the role.\r\n* `role_name` (`Optional[str]`) A name you can set for the award. Nothing is done with this value, it is used for visual identification purposes only.\r\n---\r\n### Attributes\r\n* `role_id`\r\n* `level_requirement`\r\n* `role_name`\r\n* `mention` (`str`) The discord role mention string\r\n\r\nWhen creating role awards, all role IDs and level requirements must be unique. Level requirements must also be in ascending order. It is also possible to assign different role awards for different guilds. If you don't want any role awards, set the `awards` parameter to `None`. When setting `awards`, it accepts a `dict` where the keys are guild IDs and the values are a `list` of `RoleAward`\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem, RoleAward\r\n\r\njohns_server = 587937522043060224\r\njanes_server = 850809412011950121\r\n\r\nmy_awards = {\r\n    johns_server : [\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672678586777601, level_requirement=1, role_name='Rookie'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672730583171073, level_requirement=2, role_name='Associate'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672814419050526, level_requirement=3, role_name='Legend')\r\n    ],\r\n    janes_server : [\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=851400453904400385, level_requirement=1, role_name='Silver'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=851379776111116329, level_requirement=2, role_name='Gold'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=851959077071880202, level_requirement=3, role_name='Diamond')\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(..., awards=my_awards)\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## LevelUpAnnouncement\r\n```class LevelUpAnnouncement(message=default_message, level_up_channel_ids=None, allowed_mentions=default_mentions, tts=False, delete_after=None)```\r\n\r\nLevel up announcements are for when you want to implement your own level up messages. It provides access to who leveled up, their rank, level and much more. It also uses some of discord.py's kwargs from it's `Messageable.send` such as `allowed_mentions`, `tts`, and `delete_after` to give you more control over the sent message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Parameters of the LevelUpAnnouncement constructor\r\n\r\n* `message` (`Union[str, discord.Embed]`) The message that is sent when someone levels up. Defaults to `\"<mention>, you are now **level <level>!**\"`\r\n\r\n* `level_up_channel_ids` (`Optional[Sequence[int]]`) The text channel IDs where all level up messages will be sent for each server. If `None`, the level up message will be sent in the channel where they sent the message (example below).\r\n\r\n* `allowed_mentions` (`discord.AllowedMentions`) Used to determine who can be pinged in the level up message. Defaults to `discord.AllowedMentions(everyone=False, users=True, roles=False, replied_user=False)`\r\n\r\n* `tts` (`bool`) When the level up message is sent, have discord read the level up message aloud.\r\n\r\n* `delete_after` (`Optional[float]`) Delete the level up message after an x amount of seconds.\r\n\r\n### Class Attributes\r\nThe `LevelUpAnnouncement` class provides a set of markdown attributes for you to use so you can access certain information in a level up message.\r\n\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.TOTAL_XP` The members current total XP amount\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.LEVEL` The members current level\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.RANK` The members current rank\r\n\r\nThe below markdown attributes takes the information from a `discord.Member` object so you can access member information in the level up message.\r\n\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.avatar_url`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.banner_url`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.created_at`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.default_avatar_url`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.discriminator`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.display_avatar_url`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.display_name`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.id`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.joined_at`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.mention`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.name`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.nick`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.Guild.icon_url`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.Guild.id`\r\n* `LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.Guild.name`\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem, LevelUpAnnouncement\r\n\r\nembed = discord.Embed()\r\nembed.set_author(name=LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.name, icon_url=LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.avatar_url)\r\nembed.description = f'Congrats {LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.mention}! You are now level {LevelUpAnnouncement.LEVEL} 😎'\r\n\r\nannouncement = LevelUpAnnouncement(embed)\r\n\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(..., level_up_announcement=announcement)\r\n\r\n# NOTE: You can have multiple level up announcements by setting the parameter to a sequence of LevelUpAnnouncement\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(..., level_up_announcement=[announcement_1, announcement_2, ...])\r\n```\r\nWhen it comes to `level_up_channel_ids`, you can set a designated channel for each server. If you don't set a level up channel ID for a specific server, the level up message will be sent in the channel where the member leveled up. You don't have to specify a level up channel ID for each server unless you'd like to.\r\n```py\r\njohns_bot_commands = 489374746737648734 # text channel ID from server A\r\njanes_levelup_channel = 58498304930493094 # text channel ID from server B\r\n\r\nannouncement = LevelUpAnnouncement(..., level_up_channel_ids=[johns_bot_commands, janes_levelup_channel])\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(..., level_up_announcement=announcement)\r\n```\r\n---\r\n## Handling XP\r\nMethod `award_xp` is how members gain XP. This method is placed inside the `on_message` event of your bot. Members will gain XP if they send a message and if they're *not* on cooldown. Spamming messages will not give them XP.\r\n> NOTE: Members cannot gain XP in DM's\r\n* Associated methods\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.add_xp(member: Member, amount: int)`\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.remove_xp(member: Member, amount: int)`\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.set_level(member: Member, level: int)`\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.award_xp(*, amount=[15, 25], message: Message, refresh_name=True, **kwargs)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Parameters for award_xp\r\n* `amount` (`Union[int, Sequence[int]]`) The amount of XP to award to the member per message. Must be from 1-25. Can be a sequence with a minimum and maximum length of two. If `amount` is a sequence of two integers, it will randomly pick a number in between those numbers including the numbers provided.\r\n* `message` (`discord.Message`) A discord message object\r\n* `refresh_name` (`bool`) Everytime the member sends a message, check if their name still matches the name in the database. If it doesn't match, update the database to match their current name. It is suggested to leave this as `True` so the database can always have the most up-to-date record.\r\n\r\n### Kwargs for award_xp\r\n* `bonus` (`DiscordLevelingSystem.Bonus`) Used to set the roles that will be awarded bonus XP.\r\n  * `class Bonus(role_ids: Sequence[int], bonus_amount: int, multiply: bool)`\r\n  * **Parameters of the DiscordLevelingSystem.Bonus constructor**\r\n    * `role_ids` (`Sequence[int]`) The role(s) a member must have to be able to get bonus XP. They only need to have one of these roles to get the bonus\r\n    * `bonus_amount` (`int`) Amount of extra XP to be awarded\r\n    * `multiply` (`bool`) If set to `True`, this will operate on a x2, x3 basis. Meaning if you have the awarded XP amount set to 10 and you want the bonus XP role to be awarded 20, it must be set to 2, not 10. If `False`, it operates purely on the given value. Meaning if you have the awarded XP set to 10 and you want the bonus XP role to be awarded 20, it must be set to 10.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(...)\r\n\r\nnitro_booster = 851379776111116329\r\nassociate_role = 851400453904400385\r\n\r\n@bot.event\r\nasync def on_message(message):\r\n    await lvl.award_xp(amount=[15, 25], message=message, bonus=DiscordLevelingSystem.Bonus([nitro_booster, associate_role], 20, multiply=False))\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## MemberData\r\nAccessing the raw information inside the database file can look a bit messy if you don't know exactly what you're looking at. To make things easier, this library comes with the `MemberData` class. A class which returns information about a specific member in the database.\r\n\r\n* Associated methods\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.get_data_for(member: Member) -> MemberData`\r\n  * `await DiscordLevelingSystem.each_member_data(guild: Guild, sort_by=None, limit=None) -> List[MemberData]`\r\n\r\n### Attributes\r\n* `id_number` (`int`) The members ID\r\n* `name` (`str`) The members name\r\n* `level` (`int`) The members level\r\n* `xp` (`int`) The members xp\r\n* `total_xp` (`int`) The members total xp\r\n* `rank` (`Optional[int]`) The members rank\r\n* `mention` (`str`) The discord member mention string\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n* `MemberData.to_dict() -> dict`\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(...)\r\n\r\n@bot.command()\r\nasync def rank(ctx):\r\n    data = await lvl.get_data_for(ctx.author)\r\n    await ctx.send(f'You are level {data.level} and your rank is {data.rank}')\r\n\r\n@bot.command()\r\nasync def leaderboard(ctx):\r\n    data = await lvl.each_member_data(ctx.guild, sort_by='rank')\r\n    # show the leaderboard whichever way you'd like\r\n```\r\n---\r\n## Events\r\nYou can set an event to be called when a member levels up. Using the event is considered as an enhanced `LevelUpAnnouncement` because it provides more capabilities rather than simply sending a message with only text/an embed. The `on_dls_level_up` event takes three parameters:\r\n* `member` (`discord.Member`) The member that leveled up\r\n* `message` (`discord.Message`) The message that triggered the level up\r\n* `data` (`MemberData`) The database information for that member\r\n\r\n```py\r\nbot = commands.Bot(...)\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(..., bot=bot) # your bot instance variable is needed\r\n\r\n@bot.event\r\nasync def on_dls_level_up(member: discord.Member, message: discord.Message, data: MemberData):\r\n    # You can do a lot more here compared to LevelUpAnnouncement\r\n    # - create a level up image and send it with discord.File\r\n    # - call additional functions that you may need\r\n    # - access to all attributes/methods that are available within discord.Member and discord.Message\r\n```\r\n> NOTE: `LevelUpAnnouncement` and `on_dls_level_up` are not the same. Level up messages are sent by default by the library. If you'd like to only use `on_dls_level_up`, you need to disable level up announcements (`lvl.announce_level_up = False`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Full Example\r\nWith all classes and core methods introduced, here is a basic implementation of this library.\r\n```py\r\nfrom discord.ext import commands\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem, RoleAward, LevelUpAnnouncement\r\n\r\nbot = commands.Bot(...)\r\n\r\nmain_guild_id = 850809412011950121\r\n\r\nmy_awards = {\r\n    main_guild_id : [\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672678586777601, level_requirement=1, role_name='Rookie'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672730583171073, level_requirement=2, role_name='Associate'),\r\n        RoleAward(role_id=831672814419050526, level_requirement=3, role_name='Legend')\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nannouncement = LevelUpAnnouncement(f'{LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.mention} just leveled up to level {LevelUpAnnouncement.LEVEL} 😎')\r\n\r\n# DiscordLevelingSystem.create_database_file(r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Documents') database file already created\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(awards=my_awards, level_up_announcement=announcement)\r\nlvl.connect_to_database_file(r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Documents\\DiscordLevelingSystem.db')\r\n\r\n@bot.event\r\nasync def on_message(message):\r\n    await lvl.award_xp(amount=15, message=message)\r\n\r\nbot.run(...)\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## All methods for DiscordLevelingSystem\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Click to show all methods</summary>\r\n\r\n* *await* **add_record**(`guild_id, member_id, member_name, level`) - Manually add a record to the database.

With `v0.0.2`, the structure of the database file was changed to accommodate this fix. That means if you are currently using a `v0.0.1` database file and update to `v0.0.2+`, a vast majority of the library will be broken. To avoid this, you need to transfer all your `v0.0.1` database file records to a `v0.0.2+` database file. This can be done using the `transfer` method.\r\n\r\n* Associated static method\r\n  * `DiscordLevelingSystem.transfer(old: str, new: str, guild_id: int)`\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n* `old` (`str`) The path of the `v0.0.1` database file\r\n* `new` (`str`) The path of the `v0.0.2+` database file (a brand new file from using `DiscordLevelingSystem.create_database_file(path: str)`)\r\n* `guild_id` (`int`) ID of the guild that was originally used with this library\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem\r\n\r\nold = r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Documents\\DiscordLevelingSystem.db'\r\nnew = r'C:\\Users\\Defxult\\Desktop\\DiscordLevelingSystem.db'\r\n\r\nDiscordLevelingSystem.transfer(old, new, guild_id=850809412011950121)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Inserting your own leveling system information\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Click to show details</summary>\r\n\r\nInsert the records from your leveling system into this one.

If you'd like, you can manually add those records with method `DiscordLevelingSystem.add_record()`, but that is discouraged because it is better to discard information that is no longer in use (the user is no longer in the guild)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"left\"><sub>EXAMPLE</sub></div>\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# leveling_system.json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n      \"5748392849348934\" : {\r\n          \"xp\" : 373,\r\n          \"level\" : 4\r\n      }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n      \"89283659820948923\" : {\r\n          \"xp\" : 23,\r\n          \"level\" : 1\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n# bot.py\r\nimport json\r\nfrom discord.ext import commands\r\nfrom discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem\r\n\r\nbot = commands.Bot(...)\r\n\r\nlvl = DiscordLevelingSystem(...)\r\nlvl.connect_to_database_file(...)\r\n\r\ndef json_to_dict() -> dict:\r\n    with open('leveling_system.json') as fp:\r\n        data = json.load(fp)\r\n        formatted: Dict[int, int] = ... # format the data so all keys and values are associated with the user ID and level\r\n        \r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        In the end, the formatted dict should look like so:\r\n        \r\n        formatted = {\r\n            5748392849348934 : 4,\r\n            89283659820948923 : 1\r\n        }\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        return formatted\r\n\r\n@bot.command()\r\nasync def insert(ctx):\r\n    await lvl.insert(ctx.bot, guild_id=12345678901234, users=json_to_dict(), using='levels')\r\n\r\nbot.run(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
