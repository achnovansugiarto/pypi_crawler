    "description": "seriesnatch - manage your serie needs by ease\n=============================================\n\nDependencies\n============\n* PyYAML\n* SQLAlchemy\n* lxml\n* requests\n* transmissionrpc (also transmission-daemon, for torrent downloading)\n\nDescription\n=====================\nManage all your tv-serie needs with this neat little tool, there are 2 scripts included\nseriesnatch & seriesnatch-admin. With seriesnatch-admin you can easily manage the database,\nyou can create an initial database with all records from eztv.it or clear it to start out\nfresh.\n\nWith seriesnatch, there are few options right now, the first option is --dev-mode which will\nenable logging to stdout instead of just purely using syslog. The other option available is\n--watchlist-update which will scrape eztv.it for any new releases. If any new release(s) are\nfound it will automatically be downloaded from the site by transmission-daemon.\n\nTo take full advantage of this, you should use a cron-daemon to do a --watchlist-update\nevery so often so it is automated. There are also currently one notifier available, the\ngmail notifier if configured will email any recipients with a list of updates available\nupon an update so you can easily know when a new serie has been downloaded for you.\n\nThe configuration is written using YAML and should be placed in $HOME/.seriesnatch with a\nname of config.yml.\n\nExample config.yml\n::\n  transmission:\n    port: 9091\n    username: youruser\n    password: yourpassword\n\n  watchlist:\n    - http://eztv.it/shows/683/go-on/\n    - http://eztv.it/shows/670/anger-management/\n    - http://eztv.it/shows/648/once-upon-a-time/\n\n  notifications:\n    gmail:\n      username: your_sender_gmail@gmail.com\n      password: your_password_in_plain_text\n      recipients:\n        - recipient_1@hotmail.com\n        - recipient_2@gmail.com\n\n  database:\n    filename: my_databse.db\n\nDefault values exist for transmission(username=transmission, password=transmission, port=9091), database(filename=default.db).\nSo unspecified values will be filled in, you are however expected to have a watchlist if there is any shows you are\ninterested in having watched for you. Notifications are totally optional, but may come in handy if run by a daemon.\n\nThe database files are stored in $HOME/.seriesnatch, so for that just specfiy a filename.",
