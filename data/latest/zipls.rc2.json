    "description": "==========\nZip Please\n==========\n\nA script to help you zip playlists.\n\nHomepage: http://bitbucket.org/quodlibetor/zipls\n\n.. contents::\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo make this work best you want to have pip\n(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed, although technically it\nis possible to install it without it.\n\nFrom a terminal, (Terminal.app if you're on a Mac, or whatever turns\nyou on) after installing pip, do::\n\n    sudo pip install argparse mutagen zipls\n\nThat should do it. If it doesn't, please contact_ me.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nUsers\n-----\n\nGraphical Use\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter installation there should be a program ``zipls`` that you can\nrun. Run it.\n\nThat is to say that, in general, if you run zipls without any\narguments it will give you a gui.\n\nIf you run it from a command line with playlist files as arguments,\nyou can give it the ``-g`` switch to make it still run in graphical\nmode. All arguments given to the command line should still apply even\nif run in graphics mode.\n\nCommand Line\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTypically::\n\n    zipls PLAYLIST.pls\n\nthat'll generate a zip file PLAYLIST.zip with a folder PLAYLIST inside\nof it with all the songs pointed to by PLAYLIST.pls.\n\nAnd of course::\n\n    zipls --help\n\nworks. (Did you think I was a jerk?)\n\nProgrammers\n-----------\n\nBasically all you care about is the ``Songs`` class from zipls. It\ntakes a path, or list of paths, to a playlist and knows how to zip\nthem::\n\n    from zipls import Songs\n\n    songs = Songs(\"path/to/playlist.m3u\")\n\n    # __init__ just goes through add():\n    songs.add(\"path/to/another/playlist.xspf\")\n    # lists of paths also work:\n    songs.add(['another.pls', 'something/else.m3u'])\n\n    songs.zip_em('path/to/zipcollection')\n\nExtending\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nFirst of all, just email me with an example of the playlist that you\nwant zipls to parse and I'll do it. But if you want to *not*\nmonkey-patch it:\n\nIf you want to add a new playlist format with extension EXT: subclass\n``Songs`` and implement a function ``_songs_from_EXT(self,\n'path/to/pls')`` that expects to receive a path to the playlist.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to add audio format reading capabilities\nsubclass ``Song`` (singular) and create a ``_set_artist_from_EXT``, where\nEXT is the extension of the music format you want to add. You'll also\nneed to initialize ``Songs`` with your new song class.\n\nSo if I wanted to add ``.spf`` playlists and ``.mus`` audio::\n\n    class MusSong(zipls.Song):\n        def _set_artist_from_mus(self):\n            # and then probably:\n            from mutagen.mus import Mus\n            self.artist = Mus(self.path)['artist'][0]\n    class SpfSongs(zipls.Songs):\n        def _songs_from_spf(self, playlist):\n            # add songs\n\n    songs = SpfSongs('path/to/playlist', MusSong)\n\n\nWorks With\n----------\n\nplaylist formats:\n\n    - .pls\n    - .xspf\n    - .m3u\n\nA variety of common audio formats. (Ogg Vorbis, MP3/4, FLAC...)\nBasically everything supported by mutagen_ should work\n\n.. _contact:\n\nContact and Copying\n===================\n\nMy name's Brandon, email me at quodlibetor@gmail.com, and the project\nhome page is http://bitbucket.org/quodlibetor/zipls .\n\nBasically do whatever you want, and if you make something way better\nbased on this, lemme know.\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 Brandon W Maister quodlibetor@gmail.com\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
