    "description": "# Automated Benchmarking in Galaxy\nAn opinionated Python Bioblend script for automating benchmarking tasks in Galaxy.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt is recommended to install `abm` into its own virtual environment.\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install gxabm\n```\n\n\n### From Source\n\n1. Clone the GitHub repository.\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/gxabm.git\n   cd gxabm\n   ```\n1. Create a virtual env and install the required libraries\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv .venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n> :bulb: The included `setup.sh` file can be *sourced* to both activate the virtual environment and create an alias so you do not need to type `python3 abm.py` or `python3 -m abm` all the time.  The remainder of this document assumes that the `setup.sh` file has been *sourced* or `abm` has been installed from PyPI.\n\n```bash\n> source setup.sh\n> abm workflow help\n```\n\n## Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo make full use of the `abm` program users will need to install:\n\n1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) (optional)\n1. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\n\nThe `kubectl` program is only required when bootstrapping a new Galaxy instance, in particular to obtain the Galaxy URL from the Kubernetes cluster (`abm <cloud> kube url`). Helm is used to update Galaxy's job configuration settings and is **required** to run any experiments.\n\n### Credentials\n\nYou will need an [API key](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/preferences_admin_api_key.html) for every Galaxy instance you would like to intereact with. You will also need the *kubeconfig* file for each Kubernetes cluster.  The `abm` script loads the Galaxy server URLs, API keys, and the location of the *kubeconfig* files from a Yaml configuration file that it expects to find in `$HOME/.abm/profile.yml` or `.abm-profile.yml` in the current directory.  You can use the `profile-sample.yml` file as a starting point and it includes the URLs for all Galaxy instances we have used to date (December 22, 2021 as of this writing). \n\n:bulb: It is now possible (>=2.0.0) to create Galaxy users and their API keys directly with `abm`.\n\n```bash\nabm <cloud> user create username email@example.org password\nabm <cloud> user key email@example.org\n```\n\nUsers will also need the *kubeconfig* files for each Kubernetes cluster.  By default `kubectl` expects that all *kubeconfig*s are stored in a single configuration file located at `$HOME/.kube/config`. However, this is a system wide configuration making it difficult for two processes to operate on different Kubernetes clusters at the same time.  Therefore the `abm` scripts expects each cluster to store it's configuration in its own *kubeconfig* file in a directory named `$HOME/.kube/configs`.\n\n> :warning: Creating users and their API keys requires that a *master api key* has been configured for Galaxy.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo get general usage information run the command:\n\n```bash\n> abm help\n```\n\nYou can get information about a specific `abm` command with:\n\n```bash\n> abm workflow help\n```\n\nWhen running a command (i.e. not just printing help) you will need to specify the Galaxy instance to target as the first parameter:\n\n```bash\n> abm aws workflow list\n> abm aws workflow run configs/paired-dna.yml\n```\n\n## New In 2.0.0\n\nVersion 2.0.0 refactors the `workflow` and `benchmark` commands to eliminate any confusion between a Galaxy *workflow* and what `abm` referred to as a *workflow*.  \n\n### Terms and Definitions\n\n**workflow**<br/>\nA [Galaxy workflow](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/advanced-workflow/). Workflows in `abm` are mangaged with the `workflow` sub-command. Workflows can **not** be run directly via the `abm` command, but are run through the *benchmark* or *experiment* commands.\n\n**benchmark**<br/>\nA *benchmark* consists of one or more *workflows* with their inputs and outputs defined in a YAML configuration file. See the [Benchmark Configuration](#benchmark-configuration) section for instructions on defining a *benchmark*.\n\n**experiment**<br/>\nAn *experiment* consists of one or more benchmarks to be run on one or more cloud providers. Each experiment definition consists of:\n1. The number of *runs* to be executed. Each *benchmark* will be executed this number of times.\n1. The *benchmarks* to be executed\n1. The cloud providers the *benchmarks* should be executed on\n1. The job rule configurations to be used. The job rule configurations define the number of CPUs and amount of memory to be allocated to the tools being benchmarked.\n\nSee the [Experiment Configuration](#experiment-configuration) section for instructions on defining an *experiment*.\n\n### Changes to Functionality\nWhile the functionality in `abm` is the same, some functions have been moved to other sub-commands.  In particular, the `workflow translate`, `workflow validate`, and `workflow run` command have been moved to the `benchmark` subcommand and the `benchmark run` and `benchmark summarize` commands have moved to the `experiment` subcommand.\n\n| 1.x | 2.x |\n|-----|-----|\n| workflow translate | benchmark translate |\n| workflow validate | benchmark validate |\n| workflow run | benchmark run |\n| benchmark run | experiment run |\n| benchmark summarize | experiment summarize |\n\n\n## Instance Configuration\n\nBefore ABM can interact with the Galaxy cluster an entry for that cluster needs to be created in ABM's `~/.abm/profile.yml` configuration file.  Since the profile is just a YAML file it can be edited in any text editor to add the entry with the URL, API key, and KUBECONFIG location. Or we can use `abm` commands to create the entry.\n\n```bash\nabm config create cloud /path/to/kubeconfig                          (1)\nabm config url cloud https://galaxy.url                              (2)\nabm cloud user create username user_email@example.org userpassword   (3)\nkey=$(abm cloud user apikey user_email@example.org)                  (4)\nabm config key cloud $key                                            (5)\nabm config show cloud\n```\n\n1. Creates a new entry for *cloud* in the `~/.abm/profile.yml` file.  The `config create` expects two parameters: the name of the cloud instance and the path to the *kubeconfig* file used by *kubectl* to intereact with the cluster.  The name can be anything you want, and long as that name has not already been used.  The *kubeconfig* will have been generated when the cluster was provisioned and how it is obtained will depend on the cloud provider and is beyond the scope of this document.\n1. Sets the `url` field in the profile. The `abm cloud kube url` command can be used to determine Galaxy's URL, but see the [caveats](#caveats_and_known_problems) section for known problems. If the `kube url` command does not work you can also use `kubectl get svc -n galaxy` to find the ingress service name and `kubectl describe svc -n galaxy service-name` to find the ingress URL.\n1. Creates a new user in the Galaxy instance.  The email address should be specified in the Galaxy `admin_users` sections of the `values.yml` file used when installing Galaxy to the cluster.  If the user is not an admin user then installing tools will fail.\n1. Fetch the user's API key for that Galaxy instance and saves it to an environment variable\n1. Save the API key to the profile configuration.\n\n\n## Benchmark Configuration\n\nThe runtime parameters for benchmarking runs are specified in a YAML configuration file.  The configuration file can contain more than one runtime configuration specified as a YAML list. This file can be stored anywhere, but several examples are included in the `config` directory. \n\nThe YAML configuration for a single workflow looks like:\n\n```yaml\n- workflow_id: d6d3c2119c4849e4\n  output_history_base_name: RNA-seq\n  reference_data:\n    - name: Reference Transcript (FASTA)\n      dataset_id: 50a269b7a99356aa\n  runs:\n    - history_name: 1\n      inputs:\n      - name: FASTQ RNA Dataset\n        dataset_id: 28fa757e56346a34\n    - history_name: 2\n      inputs:\n      - name: FASTQ RNA Dataset\n        dataset_id: 1faa2d3b2ed5c436\n```\n\n- **workflow_id**<br/> \n  The ID of the workflow to run.\n\n- **output_history_ base_name**  (optional)<br/>\n  Name to use as the basis for histories created.  If the *output_history_base_name* is not specified then the  *workflow_id* is used.\n\n- **reference_data** (optional)<br/>\n  Input data that is the same for all benchmarking runs and only needs to be set once.  See the section on *inputs* below for a description of the fields\n\n- **runs**<br/>\n  Input definitions for a benchmarking run.  Each run defintion shoud contain:\n\n  - **history_name** (optional) <br/>\n    The name of the history created for the output.  The final output history name is generated by concatenating the *output_history_base_name* from above and the *history_name*.  If the *history_name* is not specified an incrementing integer counter is used.\n  - **inputs**<br/>\n    The one or more input datasets to the workflow.  Each input specification consists of:\n    1. **name** the input name as specified in the workflow editor\n    2. **dataset_id** the History API ID as displayed in the workflow editor or with the  `abm history list` command.\n\n## Experiment Configuration\n\nEach *experiment* is defined by a YAML configuration file. Example experiments can be found in the `experiments` directory. \n\n```yaml\nname: Benchmarking DNA\nruns: 3\nbenchmark_confs:\n  - benchmarks/dna-named.yml\ncloud:\n  - tacc1\n  - tacc2\njob_configs:\n  - 4x8\n  - 8x16\n```\n- **name**<br/>\nThe name of the experiment.  This value is not currently not used.\n- **runs**<br/>\nThe number of times each *benchmark* will be executed.  **Note** a *benchmark* configuration may itself define more than one *workflow* execution.\n- **benchmark_confs**<br/>\nThe *benchmark* configurations to be execute during the *experiment*. These directories/files are expected to be relative to the current working directory.\n- **cloud**<br/>\nThe cloud providers, as defined in the `profile.yml` file, where the experiments will be run.  The cloud provider instances must already have the *workflows* and history datasets uploaded and available for use.  Use the `bootstrap.py` script to provision an instance for running experiements.\n- **job_configs**<br/>\nThe `jobs.rules.container_mapper_rules` files that define the CPU and memory resources allocated to tools.  These files must be located in the `rules` directory.\n\n## Moving Workflows\n\nUse the `abm <cloud> workflow download` and `abm <cloud> workflow upload` commands to transfer Galaxy *workflows* between Galaxy instances.\n\n```bash\n> abm cloud1 workflow download <workflow ID> /path/to/save/workflow.ga\n> abm cloud2 workflow upload /path/to/save/workflow.ga\n```\n\n**NOTE** the name of the saved file (workflow.ga in the above example) is unrelated to the name of the workflow as it will appear in the Galaxy user interface or when listed with the `workflow list` command.\n\n## Moving Benchmarks\n\nThe `benchmark translate` and `benchmark validate` commands can be used when moving workflows and datasets between Galaxy instances.  The `benchmark translate` command takes the path to a *benchmark* configuration file, translates the workflow and dataset ID values to their name as they appear in the Galaxy user interface, and writes the configuration to stdout.  To save the translated workflow configuration, redirect the output to a file:\n\n```bash\n> abm aws benchmark translate config/rna-seq.yml > benchmarks/rna-seq-named.yml\n```\n\nThen use the `benchmark validate` command to ensure that the other Galaxy instance has the same workflow and datasets installed:\n\n```bash\n> abm gcp benchmark validate config/rna-seq-named.yml\n```\n\n## Moving Histories\n\n### Exporting Histories\n\n1. Ensure the history is publicly available (i.e. published) on the Galaxy instance.  You can do this through the Galaxy user interface or via the `abm history publish` command:\n```bash\n$> abm cloud history publish <history id>\n```\nIf you do not know the `<history id>` you can find it with `abm cloud history list`.\n\n2. Export the history\n```bash\n$> abm cloud history export <history id>\n```\nMake note of the URL that is returned from the `histroy export` command as this is the URL to use to import the history to another Galaxy instance. Depending on the size of the datasets in the history it may take several hours for the history to be exported, during which time your computer terminal will be blocked.  Use the `[-n|--no-wait]` option if you do not want `history export` to block until the export is complete.\n```bash\n$> abm cloud history export <history id> --no-wait\n```\nThe `history export` command will return immediately and print the job ID for the export job.  Use this job id to obtain the status of the job and determine when it has completed.\n```bash\n$> abm cloud job show <job id>\n```\nOnce a history has been exported the first time, and as long it has not changed, running `abm history export` again simply print the URL and exit without re-exporting the history.  This is useful when the `--no-wait` option was specified and we need to determine the URL to use for importing.\n\n> :bulb: A History should only be exported once and the URL re-used on new benchmarking instances as they are created. Use the `lib/histories.yml` file to record the URLs so they can be easily reused with the `history import` command.\n\n### Importing Histories\nTo import a history use the URL returned from the `history export` command.\n```bash\n$> abm dest history import URL\n\n# For example\n$> abm dest history import https://usegalaxy.org/history/export_archive?id=9198b7907edea3fa&jeha_id=02700395dbc14520\n```\nWe can easily import histories defined in `lib/histories.yml` by specifying the YAML dictionary key name. \n```bash\n$> abm dest history import rna\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nGenerate SSL/TLS certificates used by `kubeadm`.  Use the `--apiserver-cert-extra-sans` parameter to list additional IP addresses that the certificates will be valid for.\n\n```bash\n> kubeadm init phase certs all --apiserver-advertise-address=0.0.0.0 --apiserver-cert-extra-sans=10.161.233.80,114.215.201.87\n```\n\n## Future Work\n\n- Run benchmarks/experiments in parallel when using more than one cloud provider.\n- Integrate with the [Galaxy Benchmarker](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/GalaxyBenchmarker)\n- Use as much as we can from [Git-Gat](https://github.com/hexylena/git-gat)\n\n## Contributing\n\nFork this repository and then create a working branch for yourself from the `dev` branch. All pull requests should target `dev` and not the `master` branch.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ksuderman/bioblend-scripts.git\ncd bioblend-scripts\ngit checkout -b my-branch\n```\n\nIf you decide to work on one of the [issues](gxabm/issues) be sure to assign yourself to that issue to let others know the issue is taken.\n\n## Versioning\n\nUse the included `bump` Python script to update the version number.  The `bump` script behaves similarily to the `bumpversion` Python package without the version control integration.\n\n``` bash\nbump major\nbump minor\nbump revision\nbump build  \n```\n\nThe `bump build` command is only valid for *development* versions, that is, a version number followed by a dash, followed some characters, followed some digits. For example `2.0.0-rc1` or `2.1.0-dev8`.  Use `bump release` to move from a *development* build to a *release* build.\n\n## Building and Deploying\n\n```bash\nmake clean\nmake\nmake test-deploy\nmake deploy\n```\n\nThe `make test-deploy` deploys artifacts to TestPyPI server and is intended for deploying and testing *development* builds.  Development build **should not** be deployed to PyPI.\n\n## Caveats and Known Problems\n\nThe `abm kube url` command is intended to retrieve the URL needed to access the Galaxy instance on the Kubernetes cluster.  However, there are a few issues that make this not so straight-forward:\n\n- the name of the ingress controller is not consistant.  Sometimes it is `ingress-nginx-controller` (AWS) and sometimes it is simply `ingress-nginx` (GCP)\n- sometimes the instance is accessed via the `hostname` field (AWS) and sometimes the `ip` field\n- the URL for the Galaxy instance may have an arbitrary path included, i.e. `https://hostname` or `https://hostname/galaxy` or `https://hostname/something/galaxy`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
