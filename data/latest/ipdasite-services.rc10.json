    "description": "*****************\nipdasite.services\n*****************\n\nThis package provides a service registry for the International Planetary Data\nAlliance (IPDA_).  It allows the general public to view service descriptions\nregistered with the IPDA service registry.  It also enables users who have\npermissions to register new services and update existing services.\n\nThis registry implementation is targeted for compatibility with the service\nregistry deployed for the Planetary Data System (PDS_), which itself is based\non the ebXML_ notion of a registry (as specified by the `registry information\nmodel`_).\n\nAlthough intended for the IPDA web site, it can be deployed to any Plone_\nbased site (and is tested with Plone 4).\n\n\n.. References:\n.. _ebXML: http://www.ebxml.org/\n.. _IPDA: http://planetarydata.org/\n.. _PDS: http://pds.nasa.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n.. _`registry information model`: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/regrep/documents/2.0/specs/ebrim.pdf\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n* Add ``ipdasite.services`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        ipdasite.services\n        \n* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n\n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    ...\n    zcml =\n        ipdasite.services\n        \n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    $ ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file, which you almost certainly are for\nthis package, since ``ipdasite.policy`` includes it as a dependency.\n\n..

It also\nmakes it compatible with Plone 4.3.\n\n\n1.0.7 — Hmm, Upgrades\n---------------------\n\nThis release makes the unit, functional, and integration tests use the\nstandard plone.app.testing layers and fixtures.  It also makes this release\ncompatible with Plone 4-latest (4.2.1 as of this writing).\n\n\n1.0.6 — 1.2 Compatibility\n-------------------------\n\nNow compatible with PDS Registry Client 1.2.\n\n\n1.0.5 — 4.1 Compatibility\n-------------------------\n\nNow compatible with Plone 4.1.\n\n\n1.0.4 — Tools, Not Services\n---------------------------\n\nWedging all the tools that IPDA registered into the ebXML Service Registry\nmodel just confused users.  So, we keep the model, but downplay the \"service\"\naspect of it and instead call things \"Tools\".  Services have tool URLs now.\n\n\n1.0.3 — That Is Not Logical\n---------------------------\n\nThis release makes sure that logical IDs (or \"lids\") throughout the system are\nkept unique.  This should help prevent a certain PDS engineer from re-using\nthe same lid \"TBD\" over and over, which is incompatible with the PDS Service\nRegistry.\n\nSpeaking of, this release also writes all of its data to a PDS Registry\nService.  Just set the \"home\" attribute of a Registry instance to the endpoint\nURL of a PDS Service Registry and all of the service registrations\nwill be synchronized into the PDS Registry Service.\n\nNote that this is *not* two-way synchronization.  Information pre-existing in\na PDS Registry Service will be wiped out by this package: services with the\nsame GUIDs will be overwritten in the PDS Registry Service, and any other\nServices will be purged.  This package therefore uses a PDS Registry Services\nsolely as redundant backing store.\n\n\n1.0.2 — More Fine Tuning\n------------------------\n\nThis release adds the slot \"interface type\" to Services.  It also adds three\nnew categories (analysis, dissemination, and visualization).\n\n\n1.0.1 — Slot Car Racing\n-----------------------\n\nThis release implements additional ebXML-styled slots needed for the IPDA\nrelease of the service registry, including:\n\n* interface type (using a controlled vocabulary)\n* description (but calling it \"abstract\" to avoid confusion with the Dublin\n  Core \"description\")\n* operating system (also using a controlled vocabulary)\n* requirements\n* curating source (institution, contact name, email address, telephone number)\n\n\n1.0.0 — Initial Implementation\n------------------------------\n\nThis is an initial release so PDS can try it out.\n\n\n0.0.0 — Unreleased\n------------------\n\nThere are no releases yet of ipdasite.services.\n\n\nIssue Tracker\n-------------\n\nVisit https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/PDSEN to find the issue tracker.\n\n\n..
