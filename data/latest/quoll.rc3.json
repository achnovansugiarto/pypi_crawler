Create a new conda environment, name it whatever you'd like, but don't forget to activate it\n```\nconda create -n quoll python=3.7\nconda activate quoll\n```\n\n2. Pip install\n```\npip install quoll\n```\n\n## Developers\n\n1. Clone the repository. In a terminal:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/quoll.git\n```\n\n2. Navigate to the Quoll directory and create a new conda environment for Quoll. Don't forget to activate this environment\n\n```\nconda env create -n quoll python=3.7\nconda activate quoll\n```\n\n3. Pip install the quoll package\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\n\n# Examples\n\nThe [examples](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/quoll/tree/main/examples) folder contains Jupyter notebooks for example usage.\n\nAlternatively the [tests](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/quoll/tree/main/tests) also go through some ways of using quoll.\n\n# CLI Usage examples\n\nTo use the one-image FRC in the command line, once Quoll is installed.\n\n```\noneimgFRC -h\n```\nbrings up the help options for the one image FRC\n\nTo run the one image FRC on a single image without tiling (i.e., estimate resolution of the entire image),\n```\noneimgFRC <image_filename> <pixel_size>\n```\n\nTo run the one image FRC on a single image split into square tiles of length `n` pixels,\n```\noneimgFRC <image_filename> <pixel_size> --tile_size <n, e.g., 128> --tiles_dir <tiles_dir>\n```\n\nThe resolution results, resolution heatmap, and the overlay of the resolution heatmap on the image can be saved with the flags `--save_csv`, `--save_overlay`, `--save_heatmap`. \n\nThe resolution heatmap overlaid on the original image can be displayed with the `--show_plot` flag.\n",
