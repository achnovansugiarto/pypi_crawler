    "description": "# PyViO\n\nThe PyViO (stands for **P**ython **VI**sualize **O**utliers) is a python package to visualize the outliers using multiple interactive plots. It employs blox-plots, donut-plots & heatmaps to show where the outliers are present in the data and how much of the data is being flagged as outlier. It also tries to estabilish a reason for why a particular data-point is being flagged as outlier.\n\nThis library has been built SOLELY for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES** and is still on its way to perfection. Please let us know if you happen to find some issue and we will be glad to put a fix for it!!\n\nContact us at **team.pyvio@gmail.com**\n\n** **Note 1** - Please use Google Chrome to enable the full functionality of this package.\n\n** **Note 2** - There might be a processing issue in cases of large datasets. For the moment, please consider trying this package on smaller datasets.\n\n## How to install\n\nPyViO can be installed from PyPi using the following **Pip** command:\n\n    pip install PyViO\n    \n## How to summon\n\nYou can summon the PyViO into your code by simply importing the `PyViO` package:\n\n    from PyViO import interact\n    interact.show_outliers(data, method, parameter(optional parameter))\n\n* Please refer to the docstring for more details\n\n## About Command Line\n\nThe literature articles on various methods which are being used to detect and visualize the outliers can be seen by using command line.\n\n    python -m PyViO <method number>\n    \n* How to see the Wiki articles?\n    * **1** to see 'Interquartile range'\n    * **2** to see 'Standard score'\n    * **3** to see 'Median filter'\n    \nAlternatively, the **help** section for this package can be seen by using the following command.\n\n    python -m PyViO -help OR -h",
