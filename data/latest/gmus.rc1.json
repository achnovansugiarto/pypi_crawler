    "description": "========\r\nGMus\r\n========\r\n\r\n.. image:: https://landscape.io/github/bedekelly/gmus/master/landscape.png\r\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/bedekelly/gmus/master\r\n   :alt: Code Health\r\n\r\nA seamless single-line player for Google Music and (soon!) local MP3 files.\r\n\r\nOptimised to run in a terminal on a single console line, using all kinds of horrible tricks.\r\n\r\nWhile this started off as a fork of Dan Nixon's PlayMusicCL, it ended up being almost completely different in the way it worked. All credits go to him for the initial idea though, and for the idea of using pygst (however much grief it was to port to 1.0!).\r\n\r\nUses Simon Weber's GMusic API, oh ye gods, I am not worthy. That code is badass.\r\n\r\nShame it's stuck with Python 2.x though (API has troubles with OAuth, and really it's all Google's fault).\r\n\r\nCommand list:\r\n\t\r\n\t* a - Adds a file to the end of the playlist\r\n\t* s - As above, but also begins playing it. Playlist is unchanged.\r\n\t* < - Skip to previous song\r\n\t* > - Skip to next song\r\n\t* Space - Play/Pause\r\n\t* Shift+Q - Quit\r\n\t* c - Clear playlist. The current song will stay playing.\r\n\t* z - Play a random song. The playlist remains intact, and the random song is appended to the end of it.\r\n\t* Shift+S - Append all search results to playlist.\r\n\t* Shift+A - Adds a file to the end of the playlist, but keeps the search results loaded. Press q to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nPressing Control-C on any 'Search:' prompt will safely cancel the request and return you to the main player interface.",
