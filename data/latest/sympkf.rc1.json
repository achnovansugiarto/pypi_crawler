Hence, the design of the parameter \ndynamics is crucial while it can be tedious to do this by hand.\nThis contribution introduces a python package, SymPKF, able to compute PKF dynamics \nfor univariate statistics and when the covariance model is parameterized from the \nvariance and the local anisotropy of the correlations. The ability of SymPKF to \nproduce the PKF dynamics is shown on a non-linear diffusive advection (Burgers equation) \nover a 1D domain and the linear advection over a 2D domain. The computation of the PKF \ndynamics is performed at a symbolic level using [sympy](https://www.sympy.org) ([Meurer2017][]), but an automatic code generator is also \nintroduced to perform numerical simulations. A final multivariate example \nillustrates the potential of SymPKF to go beyond the univariate case.\n\n\n  - [O. Pannekoucke and P. Arbogast, “SymPKF (v1.0): a symbolic and computational toolbox for the design of parametric Kalman filter dynamics,” Geoscientific Model Development, vol. 14, no. 10, pp. 5957–5976, Oct. 2021, doi: 10.5194/gmd-14-5957-2021.](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5957-2021).\n\n<div>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\nThis work has been supported by the French INSU-LEFE, grant KAPA \n</div>\n<div>\n<img src=\"./figures/logo_lefe.png\" alt=\"logo lefe\" width=\"50\"/>  \n</div>\n</div>\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n### PKF for the Burgers equation\n\nTo illustrate SymPKF, we first consider the Burgers' equation. The dynamics is defined thanks to [sympy](https://www.sympy.org) [Meurer2017][]\n\n**Definition of the dynamics by using sympy**\n\nThe definition of the Burgers dynamics relies on the definition of a coordinate system $(t,x)$ and the function $u(t,x)$. A pre-processing of the dynamics is performed by the class `PDESystem` of SymPKF, as shown in the following illustration.\n\n![](./figures/sympkf_burgers-definition.png)\n\n**Computation of the PKF dynamics using SymPKF**\nThen, the computation of the PKF dynamics is performed in SymPKF by using the \nclass `SymPKF` as follows\n\n![](./figures/sympkf_burgers-unclosed.png)\n\nIt appears that the dynamics is not closed since the expression ![](./figures/expectation.png) can not be computed from the known quantities $u$, $V_u$ and $s_u$.\n\nThis shows that, in general, the PKF dynamics is not closed. \nTo go further, a closure is needed, either from an analytical expression or from a data-driven strategy as proposed in [PDE-NetGen][]\n\n**Automatic code generation for numerical simulations**\n\nTo illustrate the potential of using SymPKF, we introduce the closure proposed by [Pannekoucke2018][], and from which a numerical code can be rendered as follows\n\n![](./figures/sympkf-burgers-code.png)\n\nHere, `closed_kf_burgers` is an instance of the class `ClosedPKFBurgers` which has been generated at runtime. This class inherit from an abstract class `Model` useful methods. It can perform a `forecast` as well as an `ensemble_forecast` as shown in the following UML diagram\n\n![](./figures/sympkf-burgers-uml.png)\n\nAn example of numerical simulation performed from the runtime code is given here:\n\n![](./figures/sympkf_burgers-simulation.png)\n\nThe notebook corresponding to the Burgers' dynamics can be found in the `./example/` directory [PKF on Burgers](./example/PKF%20on%20Burgers.ipynb) (see [pdf file](./example/PKF%20on%20Burgers.pdf) ).\n\n### PKF for the 2D advection \n\nWhile SymPKF applies in 1D, it also applies in 2D and 3D domains. As shown in the following two pictures which detail the case of the advection equation.\n\n![](./figures/sympkf_advection-pkf.png)          \n\nsee the corresponding notebooks [PKF for 2D advection](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20advection.ipynb) ([pdf output](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20advection.pdf). An ensemble validation is also provided as an example, but it relies on a side package `pydap` not published [PKF 2D with ensemble validation](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20advection%20with%20ensemble%20validation.ipynb) (see [pdf output](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20advection%20with%20ensemble%20validation.pdf) )\n\n\n### Illustration of the PKF applied on a system of evolution equation\n\nThe present implementation of SymPKF can also be used to study the dynamic of multivariate situation as shown below.\n\n![](./figures/sympkf-multivariate.png)\n\nSee the corresponding notebooks [PKF for 1D harmonic oscillator](./example/PKF%20on%20the%201D%20multivariate%20oscillator.ipynb) ( see [pdf output](./example/PKF%20on%20the%201D%20multivariate%20oscillator.pdf) ) and [PKF for 2D harmonic oscillator](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20multivariate%20oscillator.ipynb) (see [pdf output](./example/PKF%20on%20the%202D%20multivariate%20oscillator.pdf))\n\n\nNote that this example shows that SymPKF can handle a system of partial differential equation.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n 1.
