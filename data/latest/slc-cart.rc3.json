    "description": "=======================================\nCart-like end-user support for batching\n=======================================\n\nAn add-on for batch processing of objects in a Plone site. Objects can be added\nto a \"cart\" and then various batch actions can be perfomed on them with a\nsingle click, such as download, delete and copy.\n\n* `Source code @ GitHub <http://github.com/syslabcom/slc.cart>`_\n* `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slc.cart>`_\n* `Continuous Integration @ Travis-CI\n  <http://travis-ci.org/syslabcom/slc.cart>`_\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install ``slc.cart`` you simply add ``slc.cart`` to the list of eggs in your\nbuildout, run buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `slc.cart` using the\nAdd-ons control panel.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAfter successful installation two changes immediately become visible:\n\n* In site's `Personal tools` menu a link to Cart becomes available. This link\n  also displays the current number of items in cart (in parentheses).\n\n  .. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/slc.cart/raw/master/docs/images/portal_actions.png\n\n* ``Add to Cart`` / ``Remove from Cart`` links appear in document byline of\n  those objects, for which the link is applicable.\n\n  .. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/slc.cart/raw/master/docs/images/document_byline.png\n\nThe link in `Personal tools` menu points to a new ``@@cart`` view, which lists\nthe curent Cart contents and provides links to various actions that can be\nperformed in batch on all items in Cart.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/slc.cart/raw/master/docs/images/cart_actions.png\n\n\nList of Actions\n---------------\n\n``Copy``\n  Add items in cart to clipboard. This is similar to Plone's `copy` operation\n  with the advantage that items (objects) being copied do not have to reside in\n  the same container, they can be scattered all over the site.\n\n``Cut``\n  Very similar to `Copy` action, but items in cart are `cut` to clipboard\n  instead. The difference becomes apparent on subsequent `Paste` operation -\n  if the items have been cut, they will be removed from their original\n  containers, while the copy operation would not touch the original object\n  instances in their containers.\n\n``Download``\n  Download all items currently in cart (packed in a ZIP archive).\n\n  NOTE: Only items that are \"downloadable\" will be included in the archive. For\n  example images, PDF documents and other files are all fine, while content\n  types such as News Items and Folders will be skipped.\n\n``Delete``\n  Delete all items that are currently in cart from the portal. Also empty the\n  cart itself along the way. Be careful not to accidentally delete something\n  you really didn't intend to.\n\n``Clear Cart``\n  This one is self-explanatory. Remove all items from cart so that it becomes\n  empty, while not affecting items themselves in any way.\n\n\nProviding a custom action\n-------------------------\n\nYou can provide your own Cart action in your own package by creating an adapter\nfor ``ISiteRoot`` that provides the ``ICartAction`` interface. All actions\nin `slc.cart` are already made this way so take them as a point of reference.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.1 (2012-11-13)\n----------------\n\n- Support for newer versions of grokcore.* packages.\n  [zupo]\n\n\n1.0.1 (2012-11-05)\n------------------\n\n- Missing egg description.\n  [zupo]\n\n\n1.0 (2012-11-05)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [jcerjak, plamut, zupo]\n\nLicense (3-clause BSD)\n======================\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, Syslab All rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n * Neither the name of Syslab nor the names of its contributors may\n   be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n   without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
