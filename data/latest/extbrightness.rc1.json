    "description": "extended Brightness\n===================\n\nCopyright Jörg Mäder - 2016-05-05 - Version 1.0.4 - http://www.toolcase.org/app/linux/extBrightness\n\nThis tool allows to control brightness and gamma for all connected\nscreens on a X11 system (which is the case for the most linux systems).\nextBrightness can be used using the terminal or the implemented GUI.\n\n**HINT**: This tool is a software solution and works additional to the \nhardware settings of your screens. The hardware settings will not be changed!\n(I simply don't know how)\n\n\n\nCommand line options\n--------------------\n\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -b NUM                set brightness (float between 0.0 - 1.999 or integer\n                        between 2 - 200)\n  -B NUM                set brightness by increment. Hint: To small changes\n                        may not work\n  -c, --count           count the connected screens\n  -d DISPLAY            Limit action to this Screen. Use 'a' for all, 'p' for\n                        primary and 'np' for non-primary\n  -g GAMMA              set gamma correction. Either one or three float values\n                        between 0 and 10 separated by ':'\n  -l                    list screens, together with '-v' the current values\n                        are shown.\n  -p                    show key of primary screen, use -v for more details\n  -r                    reset (set brightness to 100% and gamma to 1)\n  -t TEMP               set gamma using a temperature in Kelvin\n  -u                    undo last changes (saved in profile [last])\n  -D                    set the brightness to 0 or to the last value if it is\n                        already 0\n  -v                    verbose output including the ``xrandr`` command which\n                        was used to set the new values.\n  --gui                 show user interface after processing the other options\n                        (default if no option is present)\n  --version             show current version\n  --hard                Apply changes using ``xrandr`` even nothing has changed\n  --virtual             do not apply changes but show potential results\n  --file FILE           file used for saving profiles and other settings\n                        (default: ~/.extBrightness.xml)\n  -P NAME, --profile-load NAME\n                        load profile\n  --profile-save NAME   save current values as profile. If option --gui is\n                        used too, the final values of it will be saved!\n  --profile-delete NAME\n                        delete profile\n  --profile-show NAME   show profile\n  --profile-list        list all profiles. Use '-v' too for displaying the\n                        saved values.\n\n\nTips\n----\n\nThis program may set all your screens to complete darkness (brightness = 0). For such a situation it is a good idea\nto have a key binding on your system to the gui of extBrightness. After it is started you just have to hit *[r]*\nand  all screens are set to 100% brightness and gamma 1.\n\nIf you use option ``--profile-save NAME`` and ``--gui`` together, the final values from the gui\nare saved to the profile *NAME*.\n\nWith ``extBrightness -d np -D`` you can switch all external screens *off* and *on* again. Please check before, \nif one of your screens is set as primary! If you are not sure use ``extBrightness -p``. If the output is empty, \nyou have to define a screen as primary first (typically using your OS settings > screens > select one > set primary).  \n\nThe values applied (by ``xrandr``) to your system are not necessary exactly the same as you use in the options. Therefore small\nchanges may not have always an effect. Of course, you can bidn this command to a key using your OS to make it even more easy.",
