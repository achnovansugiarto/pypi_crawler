These dependencies are listed\nin *requirements-testing.txt*.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install *plume*, first create a new environment in\nwhich *plume* will be installed. This, although not necessary, will\nisolate the installation so that there won't be conflicts with your\nbase *Python* installation. This can be done with *conda* as:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ conda create -n plume python=3\n    $ conda activate plume\n\nStable Release\n--------------\n\n*plume*, and its dependencies, can be installed either with *pip*\nor *conda*. Using *pip*:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install plume\n\nUsing *conda*:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ conda install plume -c conda-forge\n\nFrom Source\n```````````\n\nBefore building *plume* from source, you will need an installation of\nthe GNU Scientific Library (gsl). There are several ways to install\nthis but the easiest is through *conda*,\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   $ mamba install gsl\n\nAfter downloading the *plume* source code, run the following from\n*plume*'s top-level folder (the one that contains *setup.py*) to\ninstall *plume* into the current environment:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nInput Files\n-----------\n\nConfiguration File\n``````````````````\n\nThe main *plume* input file is a yaml-formatted text file that lists\nconstants used by *plume*. Running the following will print a sample\n*plume* configuration file:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ plume generate plume.toml\n\nThis will print something like the following,\n\n.. code:: toml\n\n   [plume]\n   _version = \"0.2.0.dev0\"\n\n   [plume.grid]\n   shape = [500, 500]\n   xy_spacing = [100.0, 100.0]\n   xy_of_lower_left = [0.0, 0.0]\n\n   [plume.river]\n   filepath = \"river.csv\"\n   width = 50.0\n   depth = 5.0\n   velocity = 1.5\n   location = [0.0, 25000.0]\n   angle = 0.0\n\n   [plume.sediment]\n   removal_rate = 60.0\n   bulk_density = 1600.0\n\n   [plume.ocean]\n   filepath = \"ocean.csv\"\n   along_shore_velocity = 0.1\n   sediment_concentration = 0.0\n\n   [plume.output]\n   filepath = \"plume.nc\"\n\nOcean File\n``````````\n\nThe *plume* ocean file defines parameters of the ocean for each day of\nthe simulation. This is a csv-formatted text file to *day*, *along-shore velocity*,\nand *sediment concentration*.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ plume generate ocean.csv\n\n.. code::\n\n   # version: 0.2.0.dev0\n   # Time [d], Along-shore velocity [m/s], Sediment Concentration [-]\n   0.0,0.1,0.0\n\nRiver File\n``````````\n\nThe *plume* river file is a csv-formatted text file that gives river parameters\nfor each day of the simulation. Columns are *time*, *river width*, *river depth*,\nand *river velocity*.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  $ plume generate river.csv\n\n.. code::\n\n  # version: 0.2.0.dev0\n  # Time [d], Width [m], Depth [m], Velocity [m/s]\n  0.0,50.0,5.0,1.5\n\nThe *plume* river file defines\n\nOutput File\n-----------\n\nThe only output file of *plume* is a *netCDF* file that contains\nsediment concentrations for each day of the simulation.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nTo run a simulation using the sample input files described above, you first\nneed to create a set of sample files:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ mkdir example\n    $ plume --cd=example setup\n\nYou can now run the simulation:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ plume --cd=example run\n\n=======\nCredits\n=======\n\nDevelopment Leads\n-----------------\n\n- `Eric Hutton <https://github.com/mcflugen>`_\n\n\n=============\nRelease Notes\n=============\n\n.. towncrier release notes start\n\n0.2.1 (2022-06-29)\n------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n`````````\n\n- Fixed an error when trying to get the version from the command line with\n  ``plume --version```. (`#9 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/9>`_)\n\n\n0.2.0 (2022-06-28)\n------------------\n\nNew Features\n````````````\n\n- Updated the *Plume* component to be compatible with *landlab* version 2. This\n  will allow *plume* to operate with the newest version of *landlab* and be\n  incorporated into other *landlab* frameworks such as the *Sequence* model. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Change the *plume* command-line program to use *toml*-formatted input files. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- The *plume* model now builds and runs on Windows! (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n`````````\n\n- Fixed a bug where the existing deposit thickness was being zeroed-out before\n  the plume was run. The plume now adds sediment to an existing deposit and\n  leaves it up to the user to clear an existing deposit. (`#7 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/7>`_)\n\n\nDocumentation Enhancements\n``````````````````````````\n\n- Updated the documentation to include installation instructions, usage and\n  examples. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n\n\nOther Changes and Additions\n```````````````````````````\n\n- Setup towncrier to manage the changelog. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Switch from *versioneer* to *zest.releaser* to manage release versions. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Set up continuous integration workflows using GitHub Actions. CI tests include\n  testing for code style using *black*, checking for lint with *flake8*,\n  testing notebooks and running the test suite. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Updated the package metadata and moved static metaddata from *setup.py*\n  to *pyproject.toml*. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Setup up pre-commit hooks for ensuring style, lack of lint, python 3.8+\n  syntax, and clean notebooks. (`#5 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/5>`_)\n- Added a citation file that users of *plume* can use to cite the software. (`#6 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/6>`_)\n- Removed ocean and river time series from the plume command line interface.\n  The plume command now runs just a single plume. (`#7 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/7>`_)\n- Added GitHub Actions workflows for pushing prereleases to TestPyPI and\n  releases to PyPI. (`#8 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/8>`_)\n\n\n0.1.0 (2018-06-13)\n------------------\n\nFeatures\n````````\n\n- Create *plume* package that simulates 1D (i.e. centerline), and 2D hypopycnal\n  plumes.\n\nDocumentation Enhancements\n``````````````````````````\n\n- Added a new *Jupyter* notebook that demonstrates how to use simulate 2D and 1D\n  plumes using the *plume* package. (`#3 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/3>`_)\n\n\nOther Changes and Additions\n```````````````````````````\n\n- Set up continuous integration testing with Travis-CI. CI builds are run\n  for Linux and Mac. Windows support is not yet available. (`#1 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/1>`_)\n- Added a suite of tests, which use *pytest*, for testing the *plume*\n  package. (`#2 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/2>`_)\n- Added *versioneer* to manage package release versions. (`#4 <https://github.com/mcflugen/plume/issues/4>`_)\n",
