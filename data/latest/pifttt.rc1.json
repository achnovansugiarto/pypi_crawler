    "description": "# PIFTTT\n\nIt stands for \"**P**ython **IFTTT**\".\nA simple package to facilitate sending requests to IFTTT's\n\"Maker Webhooks\".\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe one method you're looking for is `pifttt.if_this`. To use it,\npass in your key and the name of the event you want to trigger, as\nwell as any optional values (up to three). For example:\n```Python\nif_this(\n    key='super-secret',\n    event_name='name of event,\n    value1='So',\n    value2='long',\n    value3='and thanks for all the fish',\n)\n```\n\n## Return values and exceptions\n\nIn case of a successful response from IFTTT (i.e., a status code of 200),\nthe content of the response will be returned. Otherwise, an exception\nwill be raised. IFTTT is not very strict, therefore there is not\nmuch where to go wrong (for example, triggering a non-existent event\nor not send a value expected by an event will both be allowed).\n\nThese are the exceptions the package raises:\n\n### `HookRequestError(Exception)`\n\nA blanket exception raised when something went wrong with the request,\nbut not much information about the error was found. The response from\nIFTTT can be found in its `response` property.\n\n### `InvalidKey(HookRequestError)`\n\nThe key sent was not recognized by IFTTT.\n\n### `InvalidArgument(Exception)`\n\nOne of the arguments passed to `if_this` is wrong (probably contains an\nillegal character).\n\n\n## Customization\n\nIf you'd like to go a little bit further, you could use the class\n`IFTTTWebhook(key, event_name)` to customize your requests.\nRequests are sent from this class with the method\n `send(value1=None, value2=None, value3=None)`.",
