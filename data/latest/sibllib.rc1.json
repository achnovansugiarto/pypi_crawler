    "description": "# Sandia Injury Biomechanics Laboratory (SIBL)\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Sandia Injury Biomechanics Laboratory analyzes injury due to blast, ballistics, and blunt trauma to help the nation protect the U.S. warfighter. Our contributions to the science of injury causation and prevention aim to significantly reduce the U.S. warfighter's exposure to serious, severe, and fatal injuries.\n\nFor more information, see our [website](http://www.sandia.gov/biomechanics/).\n\n## Library [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl#license)\n\n* XYFigure\n  * [Getting started](xyfigure/README.md)\n  * [Documentation](xyfigure/documentation.md)\n  * [Test Cases](xyfigure/test/README.md)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.6 or higher (the library requires f-strings)\n* Scipy\n* Pillow\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install Pillow\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\nFor an overview, [read the guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) from GitHub.\n\n### Get a local copy of the repository using `git clone` with SSH\n\n```console\n$ cd ~  # Starting from the home directory is optional, but recommended.\n$ git clone git@github.com:sandialabs/sibl.git\n```\n\n### Push to the repository\n\nIf you update the codebase, and wish to have the modifications merged into the main repository, you will need to either *push to the repository* if you are a collaborator (information below), or *create a pull request* if you have forked the repo (information to come).\n\nIn the `~/sibl/.git/config` file, add the following:\n\n```python\n[user]\n    name = James Bond  # your first and last name\n    email = jb007@company.com  # your email address\n```\n\nConfigure ssh keys between your local and the repo.  This assumes to you have an existing public key file in `~/.ssh/id_rsa/id_rsa.pub`.  See [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to create a public key.  See [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github) for troubleshooting.\n\nCopy the entire **public** key to the GitHub site under [Settings > SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).\n\nFrom within the repo `~/sibl/`, set the username and email on a *per-repo* basis:\n\n```console\n$ git config user.name \"James Bond\"  # your first and last name in quotations\n$ git config user.email \"jb007@company.com\"  # your email address in quotations\n```\n\n## Contact\n\n* Chad B.
