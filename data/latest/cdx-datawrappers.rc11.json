CDX is the Climate Data Exchange, \nan effort of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to create a virtual environment for the sharing of\nclimate data.\n\nInstallation\n************\n\nThis document tells you how to install cdx-datawrappers.\n\n\nQuick Instructions\n==================\n\nAs a user with administrative privileges, run::\n\n    easy_install cdx-datawrappers\n\nThat's it.\n\n\nFull Instructions\n=================\n\ncdx-datawrappers requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4\nor later.  As of this writing, 2.6 is the latest stable version.  If Python is\nnot yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source\ndistributions from the Python website.\n\nTo test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::\n\n    python -V\n    \nYou should see output similar to::\n\n    Python 2.6\n    \nindicating the version of Python installed. \n\nBy far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install cdx-datawrappers is\nto use EasyInstall_.  If your Python installation has EasyInstall available to\nit, then this one command is all you need to run in order to download, build,\ninstall, and generate command-line tools all in one go for all users on your\nsystem::\n\n    easy_install cdx-datawrappers\n    \nBe sure to run that command as an administrative user.  For example, on Mac OS\nX and other Unix systems, you might need to run::\n\n    sudo easy_install cdx-datawrappers\n\nThat will also download and install all dependencies, including Setuptools.\n\n\nExecutables\n-----------\n\n\n\nInstalling EasyInstall\n----------------------\n\nIf you happen to be on a system where your Python installation lacks easy\ninstall, fret not.  Upgrading your system to gain EasyInstall's abilities is\nquite simple.  Follow these instructions:\n\n1.  Download http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py\n2.  As an administrative user, run the freshly-downloaded ez_setup.py file\n    using your system's Python.\n\nEasyInstall and its necessary libraries will be downloaded, built, and\ninstalled for you, and the ``easy_install`` executable generated.  The\nlocation of the ``easy_install`` executable is as described above.\n\n\nInstalling Without EasyInstall\n------------------------------\n\nIf EasyInstall is not available on your system, you can still make a proper\ninstallation of cdx-client. Follow these instructions:\n\n1.  Download the cdx-datawrappers source distribution from\n    http://cdx.jpl.nasa.gov/software/dist/cdx-datawrappers/cdx-datawrappers-0.0.0.tgz\n    Substitute version numbers as appropriate.\n2.  Unpack each archive.\n3.  Change the current working directory to each newly-created subdirectory,\n    ``cdx.datawrappers-0.0.0``, again substituting version\n    numbers as appropriate.\n4.  As an administrative user, run:  ``python setup.py install`` in each\n    subdirectory.\n\n\nIssues and Questions\n====================\n\nTo report any problems with or ask for help about cdx-datawrappers, visit our\ncontact_  web page.\n\n\n..

See CDX-116 and CDX-111 respectively.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see \nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX\n\n\n0.0.6 - 11/13/2010\n===================\n\nThis release adds in functionality to do subsetting by \nlatitude, longitude, and time (adding the time dimension) \nto improve upon the work in CDX-94. See CDX-103 for more \ndetails.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see \nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX\n\n\n0.0.5 - 09/10/2010\n==================\n\nThis release updates the CloudSAT datawrappers URL. See CDX-99 for \nmore details.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see \nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX\n\n0.0.4 - 09/03/2010\n==================\n\nThis release includes a subtle, but important improvement to the GetVariableByLatLon\nfunctionality provided by each data wrapper. Instead of returning an 1 or 2 dimensional\narray of values (1 dimension if the original array was 2d, and 2 dimensional if it was \n3d) that fall within the provided lat/lon range, the data wrappers have been modified \nto return a 1 or 2 dimensional array of tuples of the form lat, lon, value, so that the \nvalues can be remapped onto a new spatial grid to support the conditional analysis scenario. \nSee CDX-94 for more details.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see \nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX\n\n\n0.0.3 - 03/24/2010\n==================\n\nThis release includes improvements to the MLS, MISR, CloudSAT and CCSM\ndata wrappers, adding in the subsetByLatLon function (per CDX-84). Additionally\nthis release includes modifications to the GetVariable function in the CDXDataWrapper.py \ninterface and all subsequent implementations to allow a constraint to be specified for \nfurther subsetting (see CDX-86 for more details).\n\nFor the issue tracker, see \nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX\n\n0.0.2 - 02/27/2010\n==================\n\nThis release includes improvements to the CDXDataWrapper interface including the\nability to subset by lat and lon for AIRS data on the AIRSDataWrapper.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see\nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CDX.\n\n\n0.0.1 - 10/02/2009\n==================\n\nThis release includes its own specially modified version of PyDAP to work\naround some outstanding issues in that library.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Initial\n===============\n\nThis is an initial release of cdx-datawrappers providing local data access to\nMISR, MLS AIRS and NCAR's Community Climate Simulation Model (CCSM) output\nnetCDF data, and remote access to MLS, AIRS and CCSM data.",
