    "description": "xdv.inventions ver 1.0\n----------------------\n\nxdv.inventions is a plone look and feel customization using collective.xdv.\n\nDependencies\n------------\nPlone 3.3rc5 or bigger. Tested with Plone 4.0b5.\nxdv.inventions depends on collective.xdv To setup collective.xdv you can follow its instructions at `package's page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.xdv/>`_.\n\nSetup\n-----\n1. Add collective.xdv and install it on your plone site using quickinstaller.\n\n2. Add xdvtheme.inventions to your buildout::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ... \n    eggs =\n        ... \n        collective.inventions\n\n    [instance]\n    ... \n    zcml =\n        collective.inventions\n\n\n\n3. Rerun buildout and restart your Plone instance.\n\n4. Go to site setup, Theme transform, and fill the xdv form enabling it and to use the static resources. For example:\n\n    Enabled: yes\n    Domains: www.mysite.com:port\n    Theme template: http://xxx.xx.xx.xxx:port/demo/static/index\n    Rules file: /absolute_path_to_instance/themes/rules.xml\n\nwhere www.mysite.com are the domains which you're going to use to access the site, http://xxx.xx.xx.xxx is the ip number of the site, or a file system path in your server to reach the file index.html. Click on save and if you access using www.mysite.com you should get the inventions look and feel customization.\n\nIf you're trying it locally, it could be something like:\n\n    Domains: localhost:8080\n    Theme template: http://127.0.0.1:8080/MY-PLONE-SITE/index\n    Rules file: /PATH-TO-BOULDOUT-EGGS/xdvtheme.inventions/rules.xml\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n- http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theming\n- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.xdv\n\nCredits\n-------\ninventions is a design made by sdworkz, http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/11103\nxdv.inventions is rewritten for xdv by Roberto Allende - rover@menttes.com\ncollective.xdv is developed by Martin Aspeli\n\nCopyright\n---------\nxdvtheme.inventions is copyright by Menttes and it's published with GPLv2 Licence.\n\n  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n  (at your option) any later version.\n\n  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
