Whilst there are many useful (and powerful) software tools\navailable for working with TESS data, they are mostly provided as various steps\nin the data reduction process --- to our knowledge there are no programs that\nautomate the full process from downloading the data (start) to obtaining\nrotation period measurements (finish). The software provided here fills this\ngap. Using as little information as the name of the target, the tessilator is\ncapable of providing a robust lightcurve analysis and produces high-quality figures\nand tables ready for publication. Sit back and let the tessilator do the hard work!\n\nThe steps are:\n\n(1) download photometric time-series data from TESS.\n\n(2) scan the Gaia DR3 catalogue to quantify the level of background\n    contamination from nearby sources.\n\n(3) clean the lightcurves for poor quality data caused by systematic and\n    instrumental effects.\n\n(4) normalize and detrend lightcurves over the whole sector of observations.\n\n(5) measure stellar rotation periods using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method\n\n(6) quantify various data quality metrics from photometric time-series data\n    which can be used by the user to assess data reliability\n\nWays to use the tessilator\n--------------------------\n**Using TESScut to obtain \"cutout\" images**\n\nIn this module, the data is downloaded from [TESSCut (Brasseur et al. 2019)](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/) -- a service which allows the user to acquire a stack of \"postage-stamp\" image frames ordered in time sequence and centered on the supplied sky coordinate. It uses modules from the [TesscutClass](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/astroquery.mast.TesscutClass.html) to download the data, then applies steps 2-6 (above). This software is recommended for users who require a relatively fast extraction for a manageable number of targets. With the correct pre-requisite Python modules and an uninterrupted internet connection, a target with 5 sectors of TESS data takes approximately 1-2 minutes to complete (and approximately 3-4 minutes should the user want to analyse the lightcurves of a few neighbouring contaminants). The user can process a list of targets automatically by calling the ``all_sources_cutout.py`` function\n\n**Analysing full-frame calibrated images**\n\nIf the user is interested in conducting a much larger survey, it is faster to run\nthe tessilator using the calibrated full-frame images. These can be downloaded in\nbulk at the [MAST archive.](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/bulk_downloads/bulk_downloads_ffi-tp-lc-dv.html)\nThis method works much faster than TESS Cutouts because multiple lightcurves can be\nextracted simultaneously due to the vectorisation made possible with numpy/C-style\nmethods. The authors have tested this method for a catalogue of ~1 million targets,\nwhich took less than a week to complete. The user can process a list of targets automatically by calling the ``all_sources_sector.py`` function.\n\nNotes on using the tessilator\n-----------------------------\nShould there be any problems in using this software please contact Alex Binks\n(lead author) at abinks@mit.edu\n\nIf this package is useful for research leading to publication we would\nappreciate the following acknowledgement:\n\n\"The data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was acquired\nusing the tessilator software package (Binks et al. 2023).\"\n\nLicence: MIT\n\nAlexander Binks and Moritz Guenther, 2023\n",
