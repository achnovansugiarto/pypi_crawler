Especially meaningful with Git,\n  because this used to replace nice tags with SHAs that are less\n  reliable.\n- github #20: value of ``recipe`` option now gets copied to extracted\n  buildout even if it has no extras such as ``[bzr]``\n\nDocumentation\n+++++++++++++\n\n- github #73: consistency of working dirs in shell code examples\n- github #60: new responsive theme using `Sphinx\n  Bootstrap Theme <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`_\n- renamed many occurrences of OpenERP to Odoo\n\nDevelopment\n+++++++++++\n\n- Github pull requests get tested by Travis with Coveralls.\n  `Anybox's buildbot <https://buildbot.anybox.fr>`_ is still around\n  for integration tests actually requiring to install Odoo and to run\n  unit test against slightly different software bases\n- cleanup and unification of ``setup.py`` subcommands\n- less setuptools clutter in unit tests runs\n\nanybox.recipe.odoo 1.9.1 (2014-12-17)\n-------------------------------------\n\n- github #20: Avoid duplicate entries in the addons option generated by\n  extract-downloads-to\n- github #7: template for ``upgrade.py`` was missing for a.r.odoo\n\nanybox.recipe.openerp 1.9.1 (2015-01-12)\n----------------------------------------\n- github PR #5: ``ir_model_data`` helpers for\n  the ``Session`` API (sripts and python shell)\n- github #6: fixed download URL for OpenERP 6.1-1\n- github #3: [git] support HEAD as a (remote) revision\n  specification. In a related way, added the branch indication to SHA\n  pinning, which isn't deprecated any more due to wide usage, only\n  warned that it's suboptimal.\n\nanybox.recipe.odoo 1.9.0 (2014-12-05)\n-------------------------------------\n- first release, skimmed from anybox.recipe.openerp 1.9.0\n- rename to anybox.recipe.odoo\n\nanybox.recipe.openerp 1.9.0 (2014-12-02)\n----------------------------------------\n- launchpad #1332147: insensitivity to project name in setup.py\n  (openerp, odoo, whatever).\n- launchpad #1332465: [git] support for shallow clones (--depth),\n  refactor to allow this consistently with detached head states,\n  branch changes, etc.\n- launchpad #1358353: with github layout, respect ordering if the place of the\n  standards (non-base) addons is explicitely set as 'local' (allows to insert\n  overrides before them).\n- launchpad #1391571 (related): revert used to fail with grouped\n  standalone addons\n- launchpad #1391571 (related): revert used to fail if some sources\n  were 'local' or 'downloadable'.\n- launchpad #1214832 (related): introduction of explicit 'group'\n  option for standalone addons.\n- launchpad #1294020: vcs-revert=on-merge option, and implementation\n  for bzr\n- launchpad #1274174: new feature for automatic merge of remote VCS\n  sources, with bzr support.\n- launchpad #1327773: [git] support for automatic merges\n- launchpad #1392913: extract-download-to completely removes the\n  gp.vcsdevelop extension and the bzr extra in the produced buildout\n- launchpad #1232729: handling of server-wide modules by the recipe\n- launchpad #1327609: support inline comments in multi-line options\n\n1.8.6 (2014-11-17)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1358353: with github layout, respect ordering if the place of the\n  standards (non-base) addons is explicitely set as 'local' (allows to insert\n  overrides before them).\n- launchpad #1391258: [git] clear-retry is now honoured (a last chance\n  in case of non updatable repos), but a 'git reset' gets tried first\n  to circumvent impossible fast-forwards and avoid full recloning in\n  these cases.\n- launchpad #1208028: another case where parsing of exception while\n  installing egg failed. Rewrote the whole logic, with much unit-testing\n- fixed URL and filenames for nightlies\n\n1.8.5 (2014-07-29)\n------------------\n- gevent script generation backported to version 7.saas~3 and following\n- launchpad #1343518: versions < 8 with layout of odoo on Github had severe\n  shadowing issues.\n- launchpad #1338405: [odoo] provided necessary environments init in session\n  (needed for interactive session and various scripts)\n- launchpad #1249566: [bzr] avoid outgoing requests in offline mode\n  due to lp: locations resolution\n- launchpad #1244721: fixed final reporting of upgrade script with python 2.6\n- launchpad #1208745: [hg] robustness about content of .hg/hgrc\n\n1.8.4 (2014-06-16)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1327756: support new addons layout on github\n- launchpad #1324579: [odoo] generation of gevent script (longpolling)\n  and have it used through the --workers option\n- launchpad #1321919: [v8] fixed potential masking of standard library\n  by addons of the same name\n- launchpad #1234014: [git] tracked branch were not properly updated\n  if the branch was already the current one\n- launchpad #1320198: [bzr] using revids internally and in particular\n  in freeze/extract features\n- launchpad #1320198: [bzr] forbidding change of parent location in\n  offline mode unless this is for a fixed revision ID (no ambiguity),\n  and forcing a pull in non offline mode.\n- launchpad #1317269: [v8] OpenERP server can't start in a multi workers mode\n- launchpad #1314566: [v8] OpenERP scripts & interpreter can't load db\n\n1.8.3 (2014-04-19)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1281262: new ``openerp-log-level`` modifier in ``openerp_scripts``\n- launchpad #1289761: using the proper ``zc.buildout.UserError`` in\n  lots of places.\n- launchpad #1296178: have unparseable addons lines end up in\n  ``UserError`` as well.\n- launchpad #1229908: fixed tarball download url for the 6.0.x releases\n\n1.8.2 (2014-02-08)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1275168: when freeze nightly version was not set correctly\n- launchpad #1245261: new ``--init-all`` option in ``test_openerp``\n  and ``start_openerp`` scripts.\n\n1.8.1 (2013-10-17)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1235946 (demo data): consistent behaviour and capability\n  to load them.\n- launchpad #1239721: now session has 'is_initialization' attribute for\n  creation use-cases of upgrade script; using it to improve logging,\n  and in default upgrade script.\n\n\n1.8.0 (2013-10-01)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1222482: upgrade toolkit and upgrade scripts generation\n- launchpad #1222116: [Gunicorn] option to preload databases\n\n1.7.4 (unreleased)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1246822: restored the ordering of addons_path as it was\n  in 1.7.0 (main addons first).\n\n1.7.3 (2013-10-17)\n------------------\n- Fixed the licence in ``setup.py`` and hence on PyPI page. The ZPL\n  indicated was contradictory with what is stated on Launchpad's\n  project page, and plain non applicable, since the recipe *does* import\n  from OpenERP.\n- launchpad #1232806: custom interpreter and openerp_scripts now work\n  with OpenERP 6.1\n- launchpad #1233606: [bzr] lightweight checkout now respects --offline\n\n1.7.2 (2013-09-29)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1232724: [gunicorn] properly switching openerp to\n  multi-process mode\n- SAAS versions now recognized, and treated as X.5\n- launchpad #1228997: [v5] in some cases, start_openerp --stop-after-init was\n  not honoured.\n- launchpad #1222562: [git] error in extract-downloads-to\n\n1.7.1 (2013-09-07)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1215838: don't freeze develop / gp.vcsdevelop distributions\n- launchpad #1213469: openerp scripts: support for entry point\n  arguments\n- launchpad #1215833: preserve regular develops in extract-downloads-to\n- launchpad #1215873: [git] re-buildout with revision fixed versions crashes\n- launchpad #1217816: [bzr] proper update of lightweight checkouts\n- launchpad #1203550: [v8] using the openerpcommand that comes now bundled\n  with openobject-server\n- launchpad MP #182002: new 'etc-directory' option (default behaviour\n  unchanged).\n- launchpad #1208028: wrong error message in case of distribution\n  version conflict\n- launchpad #1216498: fixed python interpreter extra paths\n- launchpad #1216835: [bzr] mispelling in 'lightweight-checkout' option\n- launchpad #1205063: no more error if no addons are specified (might\n  lead to problems with the default config, though, because of server\n  wide modules, but that's supposed to be overridable)\n\n\n1.7.0 (2013-07-26)\n------------------\n- launchpad #1189160: easy integration of general purpose unit test launchers\n- launchpad #1201715: allow easily working in a virtualenv with extra-requires\n  on bzr (allows easily to work with zc.buildout 2.2 on systems providing \n  setuptools < 0.7 / distribute) \n- launchpad #1202150: [git] proper support for remote branches\n- launchpad #1200449: new flexible ``openerp_scripts``;
