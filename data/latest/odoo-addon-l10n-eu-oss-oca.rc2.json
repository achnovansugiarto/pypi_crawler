Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings > Taxes*.\n#. You can see that user can choose *Add new taxes* for applying EU taxes regarding OSS.\n#. Select the company where you want to add these new taxes.\n#. Select the EU countries where you can send your goods.\n#. Select if you want these new taxes to be configured as included in price.\n#. Select the general, reduced, super reduced and second super reduced taxes according your accounting plan.\n#. Remember that you shouldn't configure unexisting taxes for your accounting plan.\n#. Click *Create Fiscal Positions and Taxes* button to continue.\n#. According your configuration, new taxes and fiscal positions will be created.\n\n**NOTE**: You should use account_fiscal_position_partner_type module configuration for making the workflow easier.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAfter the corresponding configuration of this module:\n\n#. Create a new partner and assign an EU country (different from the one set in your company).\n#. Check that this new partner has been configured as a *Customer* in *Fiscal Position Type* field.\n#. Create a new product and set its taxes.\n#. Create a new Quotation for the customer and add the new product in a sale order line.\n#. User will see that taxes will be set according the delivery address country taxation.\n#. You can create directly an invoice without starting from a SO and the pertinent taxes will be applied as well.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n#. This module doesn't take into account if one or more products\n   have different type of taxes in the destination contry.\n\n#. There are some countries (for example Spain) that have different taxes\n   depending on the region (Canary islands).\n   These use cases haven't been considered.\n\n#. There are some countries (for example Cyprus) that have\n   uncommon reduced taxes, depending on the typology of the sold product.\n   In Cyprus, it happens with *Supply of goods and services\n   of a kind normally intended for use in agricultural production\n   but excluding capital goods such as machinery or buildings*\n   where an 8% of VAT has to be applied instead of the common reduced type.\n   These use cases haven't been considered.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues/new?body=module:%20l10n_eu_oss_oca%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Sygel Technology\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Sygel <https://www.sygel.es>`_:\n\n    * Harald Panten\n    * Valentin Vinagre\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n    * Pedro M.
