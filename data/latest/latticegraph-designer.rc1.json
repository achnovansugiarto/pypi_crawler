It was primarily created for the `ALPS project <http://alps.comp-phys.org/>`_ to deal with a lattice graph of the `Heisenberg model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_model_(quantum)>`_ defined in `ALPS xml graph format <http://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Tutorials:LatticeHOWTO>`_. Support of the other formats and projects can be extended.\n\n- Git-hub repo: https://github.com/luchko/latticegraph_designer\n- Documentation: https://latticegraph-designer.readthedocs.io\n\nGUI is based on `PyQt <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_. Program is compatible with Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ and PyQt4 4.6+ or PyQt5 5.2+.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n- import and visualisation of the lattice graph saved in the `ALPS compatible lattice graph xml format  <http://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Tutorials:LatticeHOWTO>`_.\n- import the crystal structure providing the unit cell parameters, sites coordinates and the space group symmetry operations.\n- import the crystal structure from the `CIF file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File>`_.\n- export the lattice graph to the ALPS compatible xml file.\n- interactive 3D drag-and-drop graph manipulation pane based on `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_\n- manipulation edges (add, remove, change type) referring to the distance between vertices they connect.\n- xml code editor (highlighting, synchronization with manipulation pane)\n- exporting the figure of the lattice graph model.\n- `animation manager <https://github.com/luchko/mpl_animationmanager>`_ allows to animate a 3D model and save the animation in mp4 or gif format.\n- preferences manager allows setting the visual theme of the lattice graph displayed on the manipulation pane.",
