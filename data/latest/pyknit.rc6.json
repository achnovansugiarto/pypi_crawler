    "description": "# pyKnit\n\n![pyKnit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terriko/pyknit/main/pyknit-logolong.png)\n\nA set of tools for knitters to do math, create charts, and eventually more.\n\n![pyknit](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/workflows/pyknit/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)\n[![On PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyknit)](https://pypi.org/project/pyknit/)\n\n## Installing pyKnit\n\n```\npip install pyknit\n```\n\nIf you want to use the latest and greatest [grab pyknit from github](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit) and use `pip install -e` to install it in [\"editable\" mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable).\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/terriko/pyknit\npip install -e pyknit/\n```\n\nNote that when you're doing `pip install -e pyknit/` here that `pyknit/` refers to the directory.  (You don't really need the slash but it makes that more clear.) If you get an error about not being able to find `setup.py` you're probably giving it the wrong directory (and may need to `cd ..` to go up one directory).\n\n## Jupyter-lab Usage\n\npyKnit works best in conjunction with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).\nThis allows you to \"mess around\" with the functions and see the results in your\nbrowser.  I like this especially for the ability to display the charts inline.\n\nMake sure you install Jupyter and pyknit in the same place (e.g. in the same\nvirtualenv if you're using one) so that you can use `import pyknit` and have it\nwork. (You can [read more about how to install a python Package in Jupyter\nhere](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/).)\n\nI prefer to use virtualenv and pip, so I set up my environment as follows:\n\n```console\nvirtualenv -p python3.8 venv-3.8-jupyter\nsource venv-3.8-jupyter/bin/activate\npip install jupyterlab\npip install pyknit\njupyter-lab\n```\n***Developers may prefer to [get pyknit from github](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit) and use `pip install -e $pyknit_directory` in lieu of `pip install pyknit`  Remember to restart the notebook kernel to get any changes you've made in the pyknit directory while you're editing the code!***\n\n\nFrom there, jupyter lab will open in a browser, and you can create a new notebook to play around.  When you're done, you can shut down the notebook server using `^C` in the console and typing `y` when it asks if you want to shut down.  You can deactivate the virtualenv by typing `deactivate` and pressing enter.\n\nIf you want to run it again later, you can do the following:\n\n```console\nsource venv-3.8-jupyter/bin/activate\njupyter-lab\n```\n\n(The virtualenv only needs to be created once, and you don't need to reinstall.)\n\n## Using PyKnit\n\n```python\nimport pyknit\n\n# Sweater fit check math.  My gauge doesn't match the pattern but I like the\n# fabric I got in my swatch and don't want to change the needle I'm using.\n# What size should I knit?\n\npattern_g = pyknit.GaugeSwatch(\n    stitch_count=27.5, stitch_measure=10, row_count=40, row_measure=4, units=\"in\"\n)\nmy_g = pyknit.GaugeSwatch(\n    stitch_count=23.5, stitch_measure=10, row_count=33, row_measure=4, units=\"in\"\n)\n\n# The closest size to my measurements is the 42in chest one, let's convert that\n\nsize3 = pyknit.convert_stitch_measure(42, pattern_g, my_g)\nprint(f\"{size3=}\")\n```\n\nRunning that gives a new size of 49 inches. This sweater was designed for +/- 2 inches (it says so in the pattern), so that's too big unless I love a really baggy sweater.\n\n\n```python\nsize2 = pyknit.convert_stitch_measure(38, pattern_g, my_g)\nsize1 = pyknit.convert_stitch_measure(34, pattern_g, my_g)\nprint(f\"{size2=}\")\nprint(f\"{size1=}\")\n```\n\nThose give me 44.25 inches and 40 inches respectively (rounded to the nearest quarter inch, anyhow)\n\nIf I was aiming for exactly 42 inches chest circumference, I'd have the option\nof either knitting the 44 inch one and having 2 inches positive ease (i.e. the\nsweater would be a little loose) or the 40 inch one with -2 inches positive\nease (i.e. the sweater would stretch to fit me), and I would choose whichever\none I think I'd like better assuming my swatch is sufficiently stretchy.\n\nThis [SweaterFit Example file](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/documentation/SweaterFit.py) is here if you want to sub in your own swatch numbers.\n\n\n[Here's an example of how to calculate sweater sleeve decreases using pyknit](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/documentation/SleeveDecreases.md) to get you started.\n\nFor those using Jupyter, there are also several full interactive notebooks available:\n\n* [Sweater Sleeve Decreases](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/documentation/SleeveDecreases.ipynb)\n* [Triangle Hat interactive hat pattern](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/documentation/TriangleHat.ipynb)\n* [Sweater Fit from gauge swatches](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/documentation/SweaterFit.ipynb)\n\n## Why pyKnit?\n\nThere's lots of great tools for knitters out there, but they're not open\nsource, which means if I don't like the way they work, I'm often stuck with\nweird workarounds.  I thought it would be fun to make some knitting tools that\nwere a bit more flexible.\n\nI knit during conference talks, and every year at PyCon I meet a few folk who\nstop by to ask what I'm knitting and or to show me what they're working on.  So\nI know there's enough of an intersection between the knitting and Python\ncommunities for this to be fun for more than just me.\n\nAnd finally, knitting involves a lot of math.  Not every knitter loves math,\nand even those who do can get tired of calculating and recalculating.  So why\nnot let the computer do that work?  I'd like to imagine a world where I could\npublish a pattern with an interactive notebook and let people fit sweaters\nspecifically to their measurements, or figure out how to adjust a shawl if\nyou want to use all of a pretty gradient skein of yarn, or have the option to\nadd calculated stitch counts to every single row of your pattern so people can\ncheck if they messed something up.\n\nIt's going to be a while before we get to the complicated stuff, but you have\nto start somewhere!\n\n## Contributing\n\nGot an idea for a function you wish we had?  Think you found a bug?  [Let us know via the issues](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/issues).\n\nKnow open source and want to just get into it?  [Make a pull request here](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/pulls)\n\nNever contributed to open source before? Not sure what open source is? [Here's a guide on How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) that includes information on why you might want to and how to do it.  I work with new contributors regularly in my day job, so don't be shy!  I'm happy to help you figure it out.\n\nIf you find a security issue and want to contact me privately, [send me an\nemail](https://github.com/terriko/).  It might feel silly to talk about\nsecurity issues in knitting software, but it *does* parse things and display\nthings, so it's possible!\n\n## License\n\npyKnit is licensed under the [GPL-2.0 License](https://github.com/terriko/pyknit/blob/main/LICENSE)\n",

    "license": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. ",
