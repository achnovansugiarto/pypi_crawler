If you have a paid Google Workspace account, your limit is 2,000 emails per day. The limits apply to a “rolling 24 hour period”.\r\n\r\nIf the program fails to send emails to all the given email addresses, check your own email address and password. Also check if your daily limit is exceeded or not.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT \r\n\r\n\r\n",
