    "description": ".. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-LGPL--3-blue.svg\n    :target: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html\n    :alt: License: LGPL-3\n\n================\nBase Custom Info\n================\n\nThis module allows you to attach custom information to records without the need\nto alter the database structure too much.\n\nDefinitions\n===========\n\nThis module defines several concepts that you have to understand.\n\nTemplates\n---------\n\nA *template* is a collection of *properties* that a record should have.\n*Templates* always apply to a given model, and then you can choose among the\ncurrent templates for the model you are using when you edit a record of that\nmodel.\n\nI.e., This addon includes a demo template called \"Smart partners\", that applies\nto the model ``res.partner``, so if you edit any partner, you can choose that\ntemplate and get its properties autofilled.\n\nProperties\n----------\n\nA *property* is the \"name\" of the field. *Templates* can have any amount of\n*properties*, and when you apply a *template* to a record, it automatically\ngets all of its *properties* filled, empty (unless they have a *Default\nvalue*), ready to assign *values*.\n\nYou can set a property to as *required* to force it have a value, although you\nshould keep in mind that for yes/no properties, this would mean that only *yes*\ncan be selected, and for numeric properties, zero would be forbidden.\n\nAlso you can set *Minimum* and *Maximum* limits for every *property*, but those\nlimits are only used when the data type is text (to constrain its length) or\nnumber. To skip this constraint, just set a maximum smaller than the minimum.\n\n*Properties* always belong to a template, and as such, to a model.\n\n*Properties* define the data type (text, number, yes/no...), and when the type\nis \"Selection\", then you can define what *options* are available.\n\nI.e., the \"Smart partners\" *template* has the following *properties*:\n\n- Name of his/her teacher\n- Amount of people that hates him/her for being so smart\n- Average note on all subjects\n- Does he/she believe he/she is the smartest person on earth?\n- What weaknesses does he/she have?\n\nWhen you set that template to any partner, you will then be able to fill these\n*properties* with *values*.\n\nCategories\n----------\n\n*Properties* can also belong to a *category*, which allows you to sort them in\na logical way, and makes further development easier.\n\nFor example, the ``website_sale_custom_info`` addon uses these to display a\ntechnical datasheet per product in your online shop, sorted and separated by\ncategory.\n\nYou are not required to give a *category* to every *property*.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nWhen a *property*'s type is \"Selection\", then you define the *options*\navailable, so the *value* must be one of these *options*.\n\nI.e., the \"What weaknesses does he/she have?\" *property* has some options:\n\n- Loves junk food\n- Needs videogames\n- Huge glasses\n\nThe *value* will always be one of these.\n\nRecursive templates using options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOh dear customization lovers! Options can be used to customize the custom\ninformation template!\n\n.. figure:: /base_custom_info/static/description/customizations-everywhere.jpg\n   :alt: Customizations Everywhere\n\nIf you assign an *additional template* to an option, and while using the owner\nform you choose that option, you can then press *reload custom information\ntemplates* to make the owner update itself to include all the properties in all\nthe involved templates. If you do not press the button, anyway the reloading\nwill be performed when saving the owner record.\n\n.. figure:: /base_custom_info/static/description/templateception.jpg\n   :alt: Templateception\n\nI.e., if you select the option \"Needs videogames\" for the property \"What\nweaknesses does he/she have?\" of a smart partner and press *reload custom\ninformation templates*, you will get 2 new properties to fill: \"Favourite\nvideogames genre\" and \"Favourite videogame\".\n\nValue\n-----\n\nWhen you assign a *template* to a partner, and then you get the *properties* it\nshould have, you still have to set a *value* for each property.\n\n*Values* can be of different types (whole numbers, constrained selection,\nbooleans...), depending on how the *property* was defined. However, there is\nalways the ``value`` field, that is a text string, and converts automatically\nto/from the correct type.\n\nWhy would I need this?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImagine you have some partners that are foreign, and that for those partners\nyou need some extra information that is not needed for others, and you do not\nwant to fill the partners model with a lot of fields that will be empty most of\nthe time.\n\nIn this case, you could define a *template* called \"Foreign partners\", which\nwill be applied to ``res.partner`` objects, and defines some *properties* that\nthese are expected to have.\n\nThen you could assign that *template* to a partner, and automatically you will\nget a subtable of all the properties it should have, with tools to fill their\n*values* correctly.\n\nDoes this work with any model?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYes and no.\n\nYes, because this is a base module that provides the tools to make this work\nwith any model.\n\nNo, because, although the tools are provided, they are only applied to the\n``res.partner`` model. This is by design, because different models can have\ndifferent needs, and we don't want to depend on every possible model.\n\nSo, if you want to apply this to other models, you will have to develop a\nlittle additional addon that depends on this one. If you are a developer, refer\nto the *Development* section below.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThis module serves as a base for other modules that implement this behavior in\nconcrete models.\n\nThis module is a technical dependency and is to be installed in parallel to\nother modules.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo enable the main *Custom Info* menu:\n\n#. Enable *Settings > General Settings > Manage custom information*.\n\nTo enable partner's custom info tab:\n\n#. Enable *Settings > General Settings > Edit custom information in partners*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis module defines *Custom Info Templates* that define what properties are\nexpected for a given record.\n\nTo define a template, you need to:\n\n* Go to *Custom Info > Templates*.\n* Create one.\n* Add some *Properties* to it.\n\nAll database records with that template enabled will automatically fill those\nproperties.\n\nTo manage the properties, you need to:\n\n* Go to *Custom Info > Properties*.\n\nTo manage the property categories, you need to:\n\n* Go to *Custom Info > Categories*.\n\nSome properties can have a number of options to choose, to manage them:\n\n* Go to *Custom Info > Options*.\n\nTo manage their values, you need to:\n\n* Go to *Custom Info > Values*.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/135/10.0\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nTo create a module that supports custom information, just depend on this module\nand inherit from the ``custom.info`` model.\n\nSee an example in the ``product_custom_info`` addon.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Custom properties cannot be shared among templates.\n* Required attributes are for now only set in the UI, not in the ORM itself.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please\ncheck there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,\nhelp us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Rafael Blasco <rafael.blasco@tecnativa.com>\n* Carlos Dauden <carlos.dauden@tecnativa.com>\n* Sergio Teruel <sergio.teruel@tecnativa.com>\n* Jairo Llopis <jairo.llopis@tecnativa.com>\n* Pedro M.
