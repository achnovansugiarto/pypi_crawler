In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that suggests that -- instead of hard-coding road rules into self-driving algorithms -- a scalable alternative may be to design multi-agent environments in which road rules emerge as optimal solutions to the problem of maximizing traffic flow. We analyze what ingredients in driving environments cause the emergence of these road rules and find that two crucial factors are noisy perception and agents' spatial density. We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of the emergence of seven social driving behaviors, ranging from obeying traffic signals to following lanes, all of which emerge from training agents to drive quickly to destinations without colliding. Our results add empirical support for the social road rules that countries worldwide have agreed on for safe, efficient driving. \n\n\n<!-- [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/sdriving)](https://pepy.tech/project/sdriving)\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/sdriving/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/sdriving/month)\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/sdriving/week)](https://pepy.tech/project/sdriving/week) -->\n\n## Installation\n\nStable Release version is available through pip\n\n```\npip install sdriving\n```\n\nAlternatively you can install using the latest (unreleased) version using\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/fidler-lab/social-driving.git\n```\n\n\n## Nuscenes Maps\n\nPreprocessed [nuScenes Maps](https://www.nuscenes.org/) are provided [here](https://github.com/fidler-lab/social-driving/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha/data.zip), with the tagged release of this software.
