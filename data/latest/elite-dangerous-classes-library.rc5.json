    "description": "Elite Dangerous Classes Library aka `edclasses`\n\nThis README is a work in progress.\n\n# What is this library for?\nData about systems, factions and stations in Elite Dangerous at your fingertips!\n\nElite Dangerous Classes Library provides classes representing various objects in the game \"Elite Dangerous\" (systems, factions etc.).\n\nDevelopers can use these classes to speed up developing simple applications working with the game data.\n\n# How to install it?\n`pip install elite-dangerous-classes-library`\n\n# How to use it?\nHere is an example of how it can be used. Note, that system name is all that needs to be provided. The rest is loaded\nfrom the third party API.\n```python\n>>> from edclasses import System\n>>> sol = System.create(name=\"Sol\")\n>>> for faction_branch in sol.faction_branches:\n...    print(f\"{faction_branch} has {len(faction_branch.stations)} stations.\")\n\nFaction 'Sol Constitution Party' in System 'Sol' has 0 stations.\nFaction 'Federal Congress' in System 'Sol' has 1 stations.\nFaction 'Sol Nationalists' in System 'Sol' has 0 stations.\nFaction 'Sol Workers' Party' in System 'Sol' has 3 stations.\nFaction 'Mother Gaia' in System 'Sol' has 6 stations.\nFaction 'Aegis Core' in System 'Sol' has 0 stations.\n```\n\nGenerally, even though it's possible to initialize objects directly, it's advised to use the `create` method. Here is why:\n\n```python\n>>> from edclasses import System\n\n# trying to create the same object directly causes InstanceAlreadyExists error\n>>> system = System(\"Colonia\")\n>>> system_2 = System(\"Colonia\")\nError: edclasses.utils.InstanceAlreadyExists\n\n# using \"create\" method makes sure you get the same instance of System, so you don't have to worry about creating the\n# same object twice in two different places:\n>>> system = System.create(name=\"Colonia\")\n>>> system_2 = System.create(name=\"Colonia\")\n>>> system is system_2\nTrue\n```\n\nAnd here is an example of a function which is meant to find a station with mission for particular faction_branch:\n```python\n\n# missions.py:\n\nimport random\nfrom edclasses import enums\n\ndef find_mission(\n    faction_branch\n):\n    stations = faction_branch.stations\n    random.shuffle(stations)\n\n    for station in stations:\n        if enums.StationService.MISSIONS in station.services:\n            return {\"faction_branch\": faction_branch, \"station\": station}\n    return None\n\n>>> from missions import find_mission\n>>> from edclasses import FactionBranch, Faction, System\n>>> my_faction = Faction.create(name=\"Mother Gaia\")\n>>> my_system = System.create(name=\"Sol\")\n>>> my_faction_branch = FactionBranch.create(faction=my_faction, system=my_system)\n>>> mission_data = find_mission(my_faction_branch)\n>>> mission_station = mission_data[\"station\"]\n>>> print(f\"TRANSMISSION RECIEVED\")\n>>> print(f\"Commander, your presence is required at {mission_station} in the {mission_station.system}!\")\n\nTRANSMISSION RECIEVED\nCommander, your presence is required at Ocellus 'Columbus' in the System 'Sol'!\n```\n\nGenerally the library should let you focus on the logic of your application, instead of dealing with Elite Dangerous\ndata structure for 100th time.\n\n# What classes are included?\nCurrently the following objects are represented:\n- System - single star system\n- Faction - faction entity, galaxy-wide\n- FactionBranch - representation of a faction within a single system.\n- OrbitalStation - station inside a system.\n\nThe classes are not a full representation - such objects would be expensive to work with. However, they can be easily\nextended if you need to add a particular attribute. They will definitely be extended gradually in the future, as new\nneeds show up.\n\n# How are relations between objects kept?\nThere is a special class representing parent-children relation (one-to-many). It takes care of updating both sides of\nthe relation. For example, when OrbitalStation instance changes its attribute `controlling_faction`, the attribute `stations` on the\nFactionBranch instance is also updated, and vice versa. The parent is kept in sync with the children.\n\n# Can I use the classes without external data source?\nFrom now on - Yes! The whole adapter engine has been extracted, so now, apart from full auto-refreshed classes available\nin the `classes` module, you can use the \"offline\" Model classes available in the `models` module.\n\n## Model classes\nThey represent objects (factions, systems, faciton branches and stations) and keep the relation between them, but they\nare static objects, not connected to any external data source. If you use these classes, they will only store the data\nyou have filled them with. For example. creating a SystemModel of system Sol will no longer let you fetch data about\n\"Sol\" system:\n\n```python\nfrom edclasses.models import SystemModel\n\nsol_model = SystemModel.create(name=\"Sol\")\n# the model has the same attributes ed class has, however it will not look for data anywhere else:\n\nprint(sol_model.stations)\n[]\n# A normal instance of System class would at this point query API Adapter for data, but the model doesn't do that.\n```\n\n### Advantages\nIs there anything special about the model class itself if it doesn't fetch the data? Well, yes - relations. The model\nclasses are meant to work like a database - keep links between different objects in your program. Look at this example:\n\n```python\n>>> from edclasses.models import SystemModel, FactionModel, FactionBranchModel\n\n>>> sol = SystemModel.create(name=\"Sol\")\n>>> sol.faction_branches\n[]\n\n>>> faction = FactionModel.create(name=\"Some Faction\")\n>>> faction.faction_branches\n[]\n\n>>> faction_branch = FactionBranchModel.create(faction=faction, system=sol)\n# at these point the relations between are updated:\n\n>>> sol.faction_branches\n[Some Faction in Sol]\n\n>>> faction.faction_branches\n[Some Faction in Sol]\n```\n\nHow can this be useful? Even though `edlasses` have been designed to be used with the API, maybe you have some idea\nto create a whole universe simulation based on a CSV file on some Database of your own? This objects should make it\npossible to do so without writing your own classes.\n\n# Where is the data coming from?\nThe library comes with a simple adapter to a magnificent API at www.elitebgs.app (seriously, they made a great job, you\nshould check it out if you haven't already).\nEvery response is cached to avoid spamming the API with too many requests.\nApart from that, the API client is limited to 20 requests per minute. In the current representation breaking this limit\nwill raise RateLimitException. This behaviour might change in the future.\n\n# When is the data loaded?\nThe attributes are lazy, which means they get filled with data as you access them. For example:\n```python\nsol = System.create(name=\"Sol\") # no data is being sent at this point\n\nprint(sol.stations) # request for the data about stations is being made.\nprint(sol.stations) # data is already there, no request is being made\n```\n\n[//]: # (TODO: add info about how caching works)\n\n# Any words of advice?\nThe library stores the whole data in the memory - which means, it might be expensive. I've designed it to work\nwith small scripts which I plan to use along VoiceAttack, to enrich my experience while playing. It's not meant for\nmassive data analysis, to be used on web servers etc. - it's designed to work with a few systems of interest, or a few\nfactions of interests. If your app is too data-hungry, it will result in the following problems:\n- you will send too many requests to the API, causing rate limit error (or even a ban - respect the APIs!)\n- your application will work slowly - the more data the app has to keep track of, the slower it runs\n- you might run out of memory.\n\n# Can I use different data sources? Can I add more fields?\nYes, the provided EliteBgsApiAdapter is just an example. You can write a similar adapter, or extend this one, and then\nconnect it to the proper class in edclasses. I will add a more detailed tutorial in the future.\n\nYou can also use the model classes (check out ## model classes above) and create your own data source system.\n\n# Why don't you XYZ:\nThe project is in very early phase. Have any idea? Please open an issue, I would be glad to discuss.\n",
