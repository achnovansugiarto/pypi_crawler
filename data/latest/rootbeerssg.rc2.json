You can also quickly deploy it to the free hosting platform [Netlify](https://netlify.com)\n\nRootbeer is aimed for people who are new too things like Static Site Generators and strives to make it as easy as possible.\n\n# How to download Rootbeer üîª\n\nIt's easy!\n\nAll you have to do is open a terminal and put this line into it:\n```bash\npip install rootbeerSSG\n```\nOr\n```bash\npython -m pip install rootbeerSSG\n```\nOr\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install rootbeerSSG\n```\n\n## Running on your machine üíª:\nThe recommended way to install Rootbeer is to make a Virtual Envrionment. You will need a package called `venv`\nIf you don't have the `venv` module, you can install it like this:\n```shell\npip install venv\n```\nYou can do so by putting this in your console:\n```shell\npython -m venv env\n```\nand it will create a folder called `env`. You can call it whatever you want.\nNow to activate it, in your console run\n```shell\nenv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\nif you are on Windows.\nGreat! You have your virtual environment!\nIf you want to deactivate the virtual environment, just run\n```shell\ndeactivate\n```\n# How to use Rootbeer üí°\n\nAll you have to do is:\n```python\nfrom rootbeerSSG import RootbeerSSG\n\nrb = RootbeerSSG()\n```\nand run the file!!!\nThen write away! For more info, take a look at the Wiki section on the GitHub.\n\nRootbeer has two types of content: `pages` and `posts`. `pages` are, well, you know. Pages.\n`posts` are the things you write and are stored in the blog folder.\n\nRootbeer supports Markdown for the `posts` and `pages`. They will be rendered into HTML.\n\n# How to preview your site on your local machine üçÉ\n\nYou can do this in your terminal:\n```shell\ncd public\n```\nand then:\n```shell\npython -m http.server\n```\n\nand then you can go too [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and BOOM! You have your site running!\n\n# How customizable is Rootbeer? üé®\n\nHow does PLUGINS and THEMES sound?\n\nSee the Wiki for more info.\n\n# Why tho???\n\nBecause I felt like it lol and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) hosting is the monez",
