    "description": "***************\nvodcsite.policy\n***************\n\nThis is the \"policy\" package for the web site for the Virtual Oceanographic\nData Center (VODC_).  Its job is to orchestrate the package dependencies and\nconfigure them to transform an ordinary Plone_ site into the VODC site.\n\nIt was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL_).\n\n.. References:\n.. _VODC: http://vodc.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n* Add ``vodcsite.policy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        ipdasite.policy\n\n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    $ ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou don't need to specify a ZCML slug because this package uses an `automatic\ninclusion mechanism`_.\n\n\n.. References:\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\n.. _`automatic inclusion mechanism`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.autoinclude\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0.1 — Missing Files\n---------------------\n\nSeveral files were missing in 1.0.0.  1.0.1 has them.\n\n\n1.0.0 — Cleaned Up\n------------------\n\nThis release makes vodcsite.policy compatible with Plone 4 and marks an\nofficial release as a Python egg.\n\n\n0.0.0 — Unreleased\n------------------\n\n* Initial release\n\n\nCopyright and License\n=====================\n\nCopyright © 2008–2012 by the California Institute of Technology.
