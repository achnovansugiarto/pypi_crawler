Developers and report analysts can write SQL queries in their preferred editor, manage them with standard version control tools, and upload or mount them into a Nerium installation. In keeping with SQLAlchemy usage, query parameters can be specified in `key=value` format, and (_safely_!) injected into your query in `:key` format. Queries can also include [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/) template syntax, allowing greater flexibility and reuse of SQL logic.\n\nDefault JSON output represents `data` as an array of objects, one per result row, with database column names as keys. The default schema also provides top-level nodes for `name`, `metadata`, and `params` (details below). A `compact` JSON output format may also be requested, with separate `column` (array of column names) and `data` (array of row value arrays) nodes for compactness. Additional formats can be added by adding [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io) schema definitions to `format_files`.\n\nNerium supports any backend database that SQLAlchemy can, but since none of these are hard dependencies, drivers aren't included in the default setup, and the Dockerfile only supports PostgreSQL. If you want Nerium to work with other databases, you can install Python connectors with `pip`, either in a virtualenv or by creating your own Dockerfile using `FROM tymxqo/nerium`. (To ease installation, options for `nerium[mysql]` and `nerium[pg]` are provided as [extras](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras) in `setup.py`)\n\n## Install/Run\n\n### Using Docker\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name=nerium \\\n--envfile=.env \\\n-v /local/path/to/query_files:/app/query_files\n-v /local/path/to/format_files:/app/format_files \\\n-p 5000:5000 tymxqo/nerium\n\ncurl http://localhost:5000/v1/<query_name>?<params>\n```\n\nYou might also want to use `tymxqo/nerium` as a base image for your own custom container, in order to add different database drivers, etc. Or you can build locally from the included Dockerfile. The base image includes the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL adapter, along with `gunicorn` WSGI server for a production-ready service.\n\n### Local install\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install nerium[pg]\n```\n\nOr install latest source from Github:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/nerium-data/nerium.git\ncd nerium\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npython -m pip install .\n```\n\nThen add a `query_files` (and, optionally, `format_files`) directory to your project, write your queries, and configure the app as described in the next section. The command `FLASK_APP=nerium/app.py flask run` starts a local development server running the app, listening on port 5000. For production use, you will want to add a proper WSGI server (we like [`gunicorn`](https://gunicorn.org/)).\n\n## Configuration\n\n`DATABASE_URL` for query connections must be set in the environment (or in a local `.env` file). This is the simplest configuration option.\n\n### Script file paths\n\nBy default, Nerium looks for query and format schema files in `query_files` and `format_files` respectively, in the current working directory from which the service is launched. `QUERY_PATH` and `FORMAT_PATH` environment variables can optionally be set in order to use files from other locations on the filesystem, as desired.\n\n#### Read SQL queries from S3\n\nIf desired, instead of the local filesystem, Nerium can read its query files from an S3 bucket using [s3fs](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). When Nerium is running as a remote service, a cloud storage bucket can provide a convenient shared location for report analysts to upload SQL to, so that reports can be enhanced or additional reports added without having to restart or redeploy Nerium.\n\nSimply set the `QUERY_PATH` to your S3 bucket URL. Nerium looks for paths beginning with the `s3://` scheme, and reads from there when it finds one. Authentication to S3 is handled via [boto environment variables](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-environment-variables).\n\n[S3-compatible storage that does not use URLs beginning with `s3://` is not supported. Neither is reading marshmallow format files from S3. Both may be coming in a later release.]\n\n### Multiple Data Sources\n\nIf you want to query multiple databases from a single Nerium installation, any individual query file can define its own `database_url` as a key in YAML front matter (see below). This will override the `$DATABASE_URL` setting in the environment for that query only. If you have a large number of queries across several databases, keep in mind that running a separate Nerium instance for each database could be an option.\n\n### Security and API key authorization\n\nAs a simple minimal microservice by design, Nerium's default security posture is to presume its clients and the network between them can be trusted, and that it is the responsibility of client applications and/or a separate authentication service to ensure that users can only request reports they are authorized to see.\n\nIf `API_KEY` is set in the environment, Nerium will check all incoming requests for an `X-API-Key` header and compare it to the envvar value. Requests missing the header receive a 400 error, and requests with an invalid value in the header get a 403. This can be used simply to afford an extra measure of internal security, or perhaps, for example, to run separate instances of Nerium in a multi-tenant configuration: each tenant receives its own key which is then matched with the setting in a particular Nerium deployment. These key values are to be protected as shared secrets, and shared with client operators via secure channels. We recommend using [`secrets.token_hex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_hex) or similar to generate them.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Query files\n\nAs indicated above, queries are simply text files placed in a local `query_files` directory, or another arbitrary filesystem location specified by `QUERY_PATH` in the environment. The base name of the file (`stem` in Python `pathlib` parlance) will determine the `{query_name}` portion of the matching API endpoint.\n\n### Query parameters\n\nUse `:<param>` to specify bind parameters in your query text. Clients can then specify values for these bind parameters in their request, passed either as JSON or query string arguments.\n\n### Metadata\n\nQuery files can optionally include a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) metadata frontmatter block. The use of a special comment for metadata allows for the SQL file to be used as-is in other SQL clients. To add this metadata, create a multiline comment surrounded by `\\* ... */` markers, and within this comment, surround the YAML document with standard triple-dashed lines, as in this example:\n\n```sql\n/*\n---\nAuthor: Joelle van Dyne\nDescription: Returns all active usernames in the system\n---\n*/\nselect username from user;\n\n```\n\nMetadata can generally be thought of as a way to pass arbitrary key-value pairs to a front-end client; in the default format, the metadata is simply returned as an attribute of the results response. (The `compact` formatter drops the metadata.) Other possible use cases include whatever a reporting service and front-end developer want to coordinate on.\n\nThere are a couple of special-case metadata items:\n\n1. As noted above, it can be used to specify a database connection for the query, overriding the main `DATABASE_URL` in the environment\n2. If the metadata includes a `params` block, its contents are returned as the `params` object in the `v1/<query_name/docs` discovery response.\n3. Similarly, metadata describing `columns` will populate that section of the `/docs/` response.\n\nIn the absence of explicit metadata, Nerium attempts to find column specifications and named parameters for `/docs` endpoints by inspecting the query text itself with [sqlparse](https://sqlparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Although it is more manual, a metadata comment can provide greater detail in these sections — a report developer might specify the data type of a column or parameter, for example, in addition to its name.\n\n### Jinja templating\n\nNerium supports [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/) templating syntax in queries. The most typical use case would be for adding optional filter clauses to a query so that the same `SELECT` statement can be reused without having to be repeated in multiple files, for example:\n\n```sql\nselect username\n     , user_id\n     , display_name\n  from user\n{% if group %}\n where user.group = :group\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nJinja filters and other logic can be applied to inputs, as well.\n\n---\n***WARNING!***\n\nThe Jinja template is rendered in a `SandboxedEnvironment`, which should protect against [server-side template injection](https://portswigger.net/blog/server-side-template-injection) and most [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) tactics. It should not be considered perfectly safe, however. Use this feature sparingly; stick with SQLAlchemy-style `:key` named parameters for bind value substitutions, and test your specific queries carefully. It should almost go without saying that database permission grants to the user Nerium connects as should be well-restricted, whether one is using Jinja syntax or not.\n\nOne known dangerous case is if your entire query file just does a Jinja variable expansion and nothing else: `{{ my_whole_query }}`. *This will allow execution of arbitrary SQL and you should **never** make a template like this available.*\n\n---\n\n### Custom format files\n\nFor serialization formats besides the built-in default and `compact`, schema definitions can be added to your `format_files` directory, using the Python [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io) library. Similarly to query files, the app will look for a format module name matching the `{format}` specified in the endpoint URL. The app expects a `marshmallow.Schema` subclass named `ResultSchema`. Available attributes passed to this schema are all found in the [original `query` object](nerium/query.py#L28). (See [`nerium/schema`](nerium/schema) for examples of how this is done by built-in formats.)\n\n## API\n\n### Results endpoints\n\n#### URLs\n\n- `/v1/<string:query_name>?<query_params>`  \n- `/v1/<string:query_name>/<string:format>?<query_params>`\n\nAs shown above, `query_name` and `format` may be accessed as part of the URL structure, or can be passed as parameters to the request.\n\nBecause we're retrieving report results here, the request is a `GET` in any case, but parameters may be sent in a JSON body or as querystring parameters. [Yes, sending JSON with a `GET` feels weird to us to, but as we're fetching serialized results and not changing any data here, `GET` seems to be the most appropriate [REST](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/REST) semantic. It does work, we promise!] Note that `query_name` and `format` from URL base path will be preferred, even if a request to such a path happens to include either key in the request body (client apps should avoid doing this to minimize confusion).\n\n`query_name` should match the name of a given query script file, minus the file extension. URL querystring parameters (or JSON keys other than `query_string` and `format`) are passed to the invoked data source query, matched to any parameter keys specified in the query file. If any parameters expected by the query are missing, an error will be returned. Extra/unrecognized parameters are silently ignored (this might seem surprising, but it's standard SQLAlchemy behavior for parameter substitution).\n\n`format` path may be included as an optional formatter name, and defaults to 'default'. Other supported `formatter` options are described in Content section below.\n\nUnknown values of `format` will silently fall back to default.\n\n#### Method\n\n`GET`\n\n#### Success Response\n\n**Code**: 200\n\n**Content**:  \n\n'default': `{\"name\": \"<query_name>\", \"data\": [{<column_name>:<row_value>, etc..., }, {etc...}, ], \"metadata\": {<key>: <value>, etc..., }, \"params\": {<array of name-value pairs submitted to query with request>}}`  \n'compact': `{\"columns\": [<list of column names>], \"data\": [<array of row value arrays>]}`\n'csv': `<csv formatted string (with \\r\\n newline)>`\n  \nOf course, it is possible that a database query might return no results. In this case, Nerium will respond with an empty JSON array `[]` for the `data` attribute, regardless of specified format. This is not considered an error, and clients should be prepared to handle it appropriately.\n\n#### Error Responses\n\n**Code**: 400\n\n**Content**: `{\"error\": <exception.repr from Python>}`\n\n### Documentation endpoints\n\n#### Report listing endpoint\n\n##### URLs\n\n- `/v1/docs/`\n\n##### Method\n\n`GET`\n\n##### Success Response\n\n**Code**: 200\n\n**Content**: `{\"reports\": [<an array of report names>]}`\n\n#### Report description endpoints\n\n##### URLs\n\n- `/v1/{string:query_name}/docs/`\n\n##### Method\n\n`GET`\n\n##### Success Response\n\n`{\"columns\":[<list of columns from report>],\"error\":false,\"metadata\":{<report: metadata object>},\"name\":\"<query_name>\",\"params\":[<array of parameterized keys in query>],\"type\":\"sql\"}`\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`pytest` tests are located in [tests/](tests/). Install test prerequisites with `pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`; then they can be run with: `coverage run setup.py test` (or just `pytest`).\n",
