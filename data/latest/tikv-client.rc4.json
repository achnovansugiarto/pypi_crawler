    "description": "# TiKV Client (Python)\n\n![Publish](https://github.com/tikv/client-py/workflows/Publish/badge.svg)\n\nThis library is a TiKV client in Python; it supports both synchronous and asynchronous API.\n\nIt's built on top of\n[TiKV Client in Rust](https://github.com/tikv/client-rust) via\nCFFI and [PyO3 Python binding](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).\n\nThis client is still in the stage of prove-of-concept and under heavy development.\n\n## Install\n\nThis package requires Python 3.6+ and pip 19+. Currently only supports MacOS (x86_64 and aarch64) and Linux in x86_64 with GLibc >= 2.12.\n\n```\npip3 install tikv-client\n```\n\n## Install (Development)\n\n```\n> pip3 install maturin\n\n> maturin build\n🍹 Building a mixed python/rust project\n🔗 Found pyo3 bindings\n🐍 Found CPython 3.8 at python3.8\n📦 Built source distribution to /home/andy/Code/client-py/target/wheels/tikv_client-0.1.0.tar.gz\n    Blocking waiting for file lock on build directory\n   Compiling pyo3 v0.12.3\n   Compiling tikv-client v0.1.0 (/home/andy/Code/client-py)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 17.62s\n📦 Built wheel for CPython 3.8 to /home/andy/Code/client-py/target/wheels/tikv_client-0.1.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\n\n> pip3 install target/wheels/tikv_client-0.1.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\nInstalling collected packages: tikv-client\nSuccessfully installed tikv-client-0.1.0\n```\n\n## Example\n\nPython TiKV client is synchronous by defult:\n\n```python\nfrom tikv_client import TransactionClient\n\nclient = TransactionClient.connect(\"127.0.0.1:2379\")\n\ntxn = client.begin(pessimistic=True)\ntxn.put(b\"k1\", b\"v1\")\ntxn.put(b\"k2\", b\"v2\")\ntxn.put(b\"k3\", b\"v3\")\ntxn.put(b\"k4\", b\"v4\")\ntxn.put(b\"k5\", b\"v5\")\ntxn.commit()\n\nsnapshot = client.snapshot(client.current_timestamp())\nprint(snapshot.get(b\"k3\"))\nprint(snapshot.batch_get([b\"k1\", b\"k4\"]))\n\nfor k, v in snapshot.scan(b\"k1\", end=None, limit=10, include_start=False):\n    print(k, v)\n```\n\nAsynchronous client is available in `tikv_client.asynchronous` module. Modules and classes under this modules is similar to the synchronous ones.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom tikv_client.asynchronous import TransactionClient\n\nasync def main():\n    client = await TransactionClient.connect(\"127.0.0.1:2379\")\n\n    txn = await client.begin(pessimistic=True)\n    await txn.put(b\"k1\", b\"v1\")\n    await txn.put(b\"k2\", b\"v2\")\n    await txn.put(b\"k3\", b\"v3\")\n    await txn.put(b\"k4\", b\"v4\")\n    await txn.put(b\"k5\", b\"v5\")\n    await txn.commit()\n\n    snapshot = client.snapshot(await client.current_timestamp())\n    print(await snapshot.get(b\"k3\"))\n    print(await snapshot.batch_get([b\"k1\", b\"k4\"]))\n\n    for k, v in await snapshot.scan(b\"k1\", end=None, limit=10, include_start=False):\n        print(k, v)\n\nevent_loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())\n```\n\n",
