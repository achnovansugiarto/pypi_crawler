In less dense areas, limiting and minimizing this duration remains critical to preserve forest areas.\n\nPyrovision aims at providing the means to create a wildfire early detection system with state-of-the-art performances at minimal deployment costs.\n\n\n\n## Quick Tour\n\n### Automatic wildfire detection in PyTorch\n\nYou can use the library like any other python package to detect wildfires as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom pyrovision.models import rexnet1_0x\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n\n# Init\nnormalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n\ntf = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(size=(448)), transforms.CenterCrop(size=448),\n                         transforms.ToTensor(), normalize])\n\nmodel = rexnet1_0x(pretrained=True).eval()\n\n# Predict\nim = tf(Image.open(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\").convert('RGB'))\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    pred = model(im.unsqueeze(0))\n    is_wildfire = torch.sigmoid(pred).item() >= 0.5\n```\n\n\n## Setup\n\nPython 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are required to install PyroVision.\n\n### Stable release\n\nYou can install the last stable release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyrovision/) as follows:\n\n```shell\npip install pyrovision\n```\n\nor using [conda](https://anaconda.org/pyronear/pyrovision):\n\n```shell\nconda install -c pyronear pyrovision\n```\n\n### Developer installation\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to use the latest features of the project that haven't made their way to a release yet, you can install the package from source:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-vision.git\npip install -e pyro-vision/.\n```\n\n\n## What else\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://pyronear.org/pyro-vision/) for detailed specifications.\n\n### Demo app\n\nThe project includes a minimal demo app using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)\n\n![demo_app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26927750/179017766-326fbbff-771d-4680-a230-b2785ee89c4d.png)\n\nYou can check the live demo, hosted on :hugs: [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) :hugs: over here :point_down:\n[![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pyronear/vision)\n\n\n### Docker container\n\nIf you wish to deploy containerized environments, a Dockerfile is provided for you build a docker image:\n\n```shell\ndocker build . -t <YOUR_IMAGE_TAG>\n```\n\n### Minimal API template\n\nLooking for a boilerplate to deploy a model from PyroVision with a REST API? Thanks to the wonderful [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework, you can do this easily. Follow the instructions in [`./api`](api) to get your own API running!\n\n\n### Reference scripts\n\nIf you wish to train models on your own, we provide training scripts for multiple tasks!\nPlease refer to the [`./references`](references) folder if that's the case.\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you wish to cite this project, feel free to use this [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) reference:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{pyrovision2019,\n    title={Pyrovision: wildfire early detection},\n    author={Pyronear contributors},\n    year={2019},\n    month={October},\n    publisher = {GitHub},\n    howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-vision}}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease refer to [`CONTRIBUTING`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to help grow this project!\n\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the Apache 2 License.
