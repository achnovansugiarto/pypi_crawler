    "description": "A comprehensive HTTP client library, ``httplib2`` supports many features left out of other HTTP libraries.\n\n**HTTP and HTTPS**\n  HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled with SSL support.\n\n\n**Keep-Alive**\n  Supports HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive, keeping the socket open and performing multiple requests over the same connection if possible.\n\n\n**Authentication**\n  The following three types of HTTP Authentication are supported. These can be used over both HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n  * Digest\n  * Basic\n  * WSSE\n\n**Caching**\n  The module can optionally operate with a private cache that understands the Cache-Control:\n  header and uses both the ETag and Last-Modified cache validators. Both file system\n  and memcached based caches are supported.\n\n\n**All Methods**\n  The module can handle any HTTP request method, not just GET and POST.\n\n\n**Redirects**\n  Automatically follows 3XX redirects on GETs.\n\n\n**Compression**\n  Handles both 'deflate' and 'gzip' types of compression.\n\n\n**Lost update support**\n  Automatically adds back ETags into PUT requests to resources we have already cached. This implements Section 3.2 of Detecting the Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout\n\n\n**Unit Tested**\n  A large and growing set of unit tests.",
