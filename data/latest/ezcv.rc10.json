For details on setting this up, please visit [https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/#remote-editing](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/#remote-editing).\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use ezcv you will need python 3.6+ (earlier versions wont work) and pip for python 3.\n\n#### From PyPi\n\n1. Run ```pip install ezcv```\n\n#### From source\n\n1. Clone this repo: [https://github.com/Descent098/ezcv](https://github.com/Descent098/ezcv)\n2. Run ```pip install .``` or ```sudo pip3 install .```in the root directory\n\n#### Getting started\n\nThe easiest way to get started is by running:\n\n```ezcv init <name>```\n\nReplacing the ```<name>``` argument with your name (use \"\" if you want to use your full name i.e. ```ezcv init \"Kieran Wood\"```). \n\n##### File structure\n\nWhen you run the command a new folder will be created with your name, and some starter files like this:\n\n**Legend**\n\n| Icon | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n|📁| File Folder |\n|📷| Image file |\n|📝| File you should edit/delete |\n|📄| File you don't need to edit/shouldn't delete |\n\n```\n📁<name>/\n├── 📁.github/\n│   └── 📁workflows/\n│       └── 📄ezcv-publish.yml\n├── 📁content/\n│   ├── 📁education/\n│   |   ├── 📝example-current.md\n│   |   └── 📝example-old.md\n│   ├── 📁projects/\n│   |   └── 📝example.md\n│   ├── 📁volunteering_experience/\n│   |   ├── 📝example-current.md\n│   |   └── 📝example-old.md\n│   └── 📁volunteering_experience/\n│       ├── 📝example-current.md\n│       └── 📝example-old.md\n├── 📁images/\n│   ├── 📷 abstract-landscape.jpg\n│   └── 📷 ice-caps.jpg\n├── 📄.gitignore\n└── 📝config.yml\n```\n\nFrom here you can go into your ```config.yml``` file and [pick a theme](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/included-themes/), then start filling out your content according to what's available for the theme.\n\nTo preview your content use:\n\n```ezcv -p```\n\nIf you're on github then pushing the contents to master/main will activate the publish workflow and automatically publish the site to ```<username>.github.io```.\n\n## CLI\n\n```shell\nUsage:\n    ezcv [-h] [-v] [-p]\n    ezcv build [-d OUTPUT_DIR] [-o]\n    ezcv init [<name>] [<theme>] [-f]\n    ezcv theme [-l] [-c] [-m] [<theme>]\n    ezcv section <SECTION_NAME> [-t=<type>]\n\n\nOptions:\n-h, --help            show this help message and exit\n-v, --version         show program's version number and exit\n-l, --list            list the possible themes\n-c, --copy            copy the provided theme, or defined site theme\n-p, --preview         preview the current state of the site\n-o, --optimize        Optimize output files (takes longer to run)\n-f, --flask           Generate Flask routes and requirements.txt\n-d OUTPUT_DIR, --dir OUTPUT_DIR The folder name to export the site to\n-m, --metadata        Generate metadata for the theme\n-t=<type>, --type=<type> The type of section to generate [default: markdown]\n```\n\nSee the [CLI Documentation](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/) for additional details\n\n## Additional Documentation\n\n[User Docs](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io)\n\n[API Docs](https://kieranwood.ca/ezcv)\n\n## Examples and resources\n\n[Template repository for bootstrapping projects](https://github.com/qu-up/ezcv)\n\n[Template repository for ezcv integrated with flask](https://github.com/QU-UP/flask-ezcv)\n\nSee documentation for [included themes](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/included-themes/) for examples of each of the included themes\n# Changelog\n\n## V0.3.4; July 29th 2022\n\nAdding a fix for macos installations\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed macos install bugs\n\n## V0.3.3; May 25th 2022\n\nThe focus for this release was adding features that were not finalized in time for the `0.3.0`-`0.3.2` releases, and cleaning up some bugs.\n\n### Features\n\n- Added `required_config` section to theme metadata that's used:\n  - on initialization to generate the `config.yml` file\n  - on build to cancel the build if a required value is missing from `config.yml`\n- Added section command (**note** `ezcv theme -s <section name>` **will no longer work**)\n  - use `ezcv section <section name>` to get information\n  - use `ezcv section <section name> [<type>]` to create a new section (note *type* is only required for any non-markdown sections i.e. blogs [can be \"blog\" or \"b\"] or galleries [can be \"gallery\" or \"g\"]). See [cli documentation](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/) for full usage details\n- Added deepsource integration\n- Added issue template for creating new themes\n\n### Themes\n\n- Added `massively`\n- Added `blog`\n- Added `evie`\n- Added `parallax`\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed bug with downloading `aerial` theme from remote\n- Fixed bug where `ezcv_version` was generated incorrectly in the metadata\n- Fixed a bug where a theme without a `metadata.yml` file would not load properly\n\n## V0.3.2; May 16th 2022\n\nMore minor fixes\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Included missing `flask` dependency\n\n## V0.3.1; May 16th 2022\n\nMinor fixes related to release\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed broken previews on documentation site\n- Included missing `livereload` dependency\n\n### Documentation improvements\n\n- Added additional theme provider suggestions\n\n## V0.3.0; May 16th 2022\n\nThe focus for this release is on adding blog support, QoL features and making ezcv a more well rounded static site builder. There will be a few items released in `0.3.1` that were meant for `0.3.0`, but due to the need for `python -m ezcv` in order for github pipelines to work this release is going out now.\n\n### Features\n\n- Blog posts\n- Theme Metadata\n- Adding an optimized mode for builds to increase site performance\n- Added ability to create and use custom ad-hoc filters;
