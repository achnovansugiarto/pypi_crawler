    "description": "CourseGraph plugin for `Tutor`_\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|Neo4j|_ |plus| |Tutor|_\n\nCourseGraph is a tool that allows `Open edX`_ developers and support specialists to inspect their platform instance's learning content. It consists of two simple components:\n\n#. The `CourseGraph support application`_, which loads courses from the CMS's internal course store and dumps them into an instance of...\n#. `Neo4j`_, a popular open-source graph database. Staff for an Open edX instance can query the course graph via Neo4j's Web console using the `Cypher`_ query language.\n\nCourseGraph was initially an internal tool at edX, Inc., but as of the Maple release it was `shared with the greater Open edX community`_. This Tutor plugin aims to provide an easy mechanism for developers and operators to trial and deploy CourseGraph.\n\n.. _Tutor: https://docs.tutor.overhang.io\n.. _Open edX: https://openedx.org\n.. _CourseGraph support application: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/cms/djangoapps/coursegraph#coursegraph-support\n.. _Neo4j: https://neo4j.com\n.. _shared with the greater Open edX community: https://openedx.org/blog/announcing-coursegraph-a-new-tool-in-the-maple-release/\n.. _Cypher: https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/\n\n.. |Neo4j| image:: https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210423072428/neo4j-logo-2020-1.svg\n   :width: 300\n   :align: middle\n   :alt: Neo4j logo\n\n.. |plus| image:: https://www.svgrepo.com/show/99205/plus-symbol-button.svg\n   :width: 50\n   :align: middle\n   :alt: A plus sign, indicating the combination of Neo4j and Tutor\n\n.. |Tutor| image:: https://overhang.io/static/img/tutor-logo.svg\n   :width: 400\n   :align: middle\n   :alt: Tutor logo\n\nStatus & Contributing\n=====================\n\nThis is **Beta** software. It was developed as part of the `Tutor Adoption Initiative`_ for the purpose learning about the Tutor Plugin API, and it has been tested to work for with Tutor and Open edX for local development, local deployment, and Kubernetes deployment. However, it has *not* yet been tested with a production Open edX instance. Although this plugin is nominally maintained by the Center for Reimagining Learning, we do not currently have plans to do any comprehensive production-tier testing. You have been warned!\n\nIf you choose to use this plugin, we're eager to hear about your experiences! Please let us know by opening an issue in this repository or posting on the Open edX or Tutor forums. Also, if you're interested in contributing, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. We'll try to give it a first look within a week.\n\n.. _Tutor Adoption Initiative: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3315335223/Tutor+Adoption+Initiative\n\nBranches\n********\n\nThis plugin uses the same branching model as Tutor:\n\n.. list-table::\n\n   - * ``nightly``\n     * Latest development. Compatible with Tutor Nightly and Open edX master. Merged into ``master`` at each Open edX named release.\n\n   - * ``master``\n     * Latest stable release and patches. Compatible with Tutor master and latest Open edX named release. Merged into ``nightly`` continuously.\n\nThe syncing between branches is currently done manually.\n\nIf your change is backwards-compatible with the last Open edX named release, then propose it against ``master``. If not, then propose it against ``nightly``.\n\nThis repository aims to adhere to all relevant `Open edX Proposals`_, including `OEP-55, Conventional Commits`_.\n\n.. _Open edX Proposals: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io\n.. _OEP-55, Conventional Commits: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0051-bp-conventional-commits.html\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall the latest stable version (requires the latest `Tutor release`_)::\n\n  pip install tutor-contrib-coursegraph\n\nOr, install the latest nightly version (requires `Tutor Nightly`_)::\n\n  pip install git+https://github.com/openedx/tutor-contrib-coursegraph@nightly\n\nOr, install the plugin to be hacked on::\n\n  git clone git@github.com:openedx/tutor-contrib-coursegraph\n  cd tutor-contrib-coursegraph\n  source {{ PATH TO A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT }}\n  make dev-requirements\n\n.. _Tutor release: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/releases\n.. _Tutor Nightly: https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/tutorials/nightly.html\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nEnable the plugin and re-generate your Tutor environment::\n\n    tutor plugins enable coursegraph\n    tutor config save\n\nThen, run initialization in order to dump your platform's existing courses into CourseGraph::\n\n    tutor [dev|local|k8s] init --limit=coursegraph\n\nStart CourseGraph::\n\n    tutor [dev|local|k8s] start coursegraph\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nFinding the Web interface\n*************************\n\nOnce CourseGraph is started and courses have been dumped to it, the tool can be viewed at::\n\n  http://coursegraph.{{ LMS_HOST }}\n\nFor example, if your LMS is at ``openedx.example.edu`` and you're using the default Neo4j HTTP port, that'd be::\n\n  http://coursegraph.openedx.example.edu\n\nWhen running in development mode, you'll also need to specify port 7474. For example::\n\n  http://coursegraph.local.overhang.io:7474\n\nUsing the Web interface\n***********************\n\nThe **Connect URL** should already be populated correctly. If it's not, here's what to enter, substituting ``openedx.example.edu`` for your own LMS root domain:\n\n.. list-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - **Mode**\n     - **Connect URL**\n   * - ``tutor k8s``\n     - bolt://bolt.coursegraph.openedx.example.edu:80\n   * - ``tutor local``\n     - bolt://bolt.coursegraph.openedx.example.edu:80\n   * - ``tutor dev``\n     - bolt://coursegraph.local.overhang.io:7687\n\nBy default, you can log in using **Username / Password** authentication:\n\n.. list-table::\n\n   * - **Username**\n     - ``\"neo4j\"``\n   * - **Password**\n     - ``$(tutor config printvalue COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD)``\n\nIf you set ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` to ``null`` before initializing CourseGraph, then instead select **No Authentication**.\n\nNow that you're in, try `querying your courses`_!\n\n.. _querying your courses: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/cms/djangoapps/coursegraph#querying-coursegraph\n\n.. image:: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hTBEdYjUSiqsh8u8eG8us8X1XvYNUZQfvDgLcfYSh659muHd6TdH96z1eya-0OB0SlFx-2q6s02zIyar52wXMDRiR6cg6ySAG_XLDsqKgVsRVHxEXnC6hRFnf6lr_NmTiplFW_Wi\n   :alt: The Neo4j Web interface can be used to visualize relationships between blocks in a course. Here, the query \"MATCH (course)-[:PARENT_OF*]->(p:problem) WHERE p.data CONTAINS 'jsinput' RETURN * LIMIT 50\" is used to visualize problem blocks that use custom JavaScript, along with their ancestry.\n\n\nOperations\n==========\n\nOperating CourseGraph is fairly straightforward, especially if you treat CourseGraph data as a non-critical secondary view into the CMS's course data. That is: you should be willing to completely drop and re-generate the CourseGraph data stord in Neo4j. By doing so, you avoid needing to back up Neo4j, and you de-risk the Neo4j schema version upgrades that you'll need to perform over time with new Open edX releases.\n\nManaging Data\n*************\n\nBy default, this plugin configures CMS to dump each course to CourseGraph whenever it is published, allowing you to \"set and forget\" the tool. You can disable this behavior by setting ``COURSEGRAPH_DUMP_COURSE_ON_PUBLISH`` to ``false``, regenerating your Tutor environment, and restarting CMS.\n\nIf you have disabled automatic dumping, then you'll need to periodically refresh the data in CourseGraph manually. You can do so via the CMS administration console at, under the **COURSE GRAPH COURSE DUMPS** page in the **COURSE GRAPH** app:\n\n|coursegraph admin|\n|coursegraph admin success|\n\nAlternatively, you can skip the admin console by using a CMS management command::\n\n  tutor [dev|local|k8s] exec coursegraph ./manage.py cms dump_to_neo4j\n\n.. |coursegraph admin| image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628148/153106921-0e8c404b-df88-4c15-afbe-26627873d43e.png\n   :alt: CourseGraph dump page in CMS admin console, demonstrating that individual courses can be selected for dump\n\n.. |coursegraph admin success| image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628148/153107016-fc6354d8-1c61-4728-b0a4-59150a3bf7b2.png\n   :alt: CourseGraph dump page in CMS admin console, showing message after course dumps are successfully enqueued\n\n\nManaging Ingress Access\n***********************\n\nBy default, CourseGraph's Neo4j service is accessible to the outside world for HTTP and Bolt traffic via Caddy, the proxy provided by Tutor. Neo4j's bfasic authentication scheme (described in `Managing Users`_) may or may not be sufficient for your security needs. If it is *not* sufficient, then you have two options:\n\n1. Use your own Web proxy in place of Tutor's Caddy service by setting ``ENABLE_WEB_PROXY=false``. Via your Web proxy, restrict ingress CourseGraph access as desired. If you're not already using your own Web proxy, then this is probably *not* what you want to do, as it'd affect your entire Tutor deployment just for the sake of this plugin.\n2. Set ``COURSEGRAPH_RUN_NEO4J=false`` and self-manage a separate Neo4j service, whose ingress access you could control as desired. Then, configure this plugin to point at your self-managed Neo4j service so that CMS can dump to content to it. See the `Configuration`_ section for specifics. If you choose to go this route, the authors of this plugin recommend the `official Neo4j docker image`_ as a starting point for self-hosting Neo4j.\n\n.. _official Neo4j docker image: https://neo4j.com/developer/docker-run-neo4j/\n\n.. _Managing Users:\n\nManaging Users\n**************\n\nThis plugin currently ships with Neo4j 3.5 Community Edition, which provides some very rudimentary authentication controls via the Neo4j Web console. The Neo4j 3.5 page on `procedures for native user management`_ describes the available operations. Take note that only four operations are available in the Community Edition:\n\n* ``CALL dbms.security.createUser(<username>, <password>, <requirePasswordChange>)``\n* ``CALL dbms.security.changePassword(<password>, <requirePasswordChange>)``\n* ``CALL dbms.security.deleteUser(<username>)``\n* ``CALL dbms.security.listUsers()``\n\nSince authorization control is not availble in the Neo4j Community Edition, all users will have full administrative control over Neo4j data, including ability to to read all graphs, modify nodes, modify relationships, and create new users. Because of this, access to any set of CourseGraph Neo4j credentials confers read access to your entire course catalog, as well as the ability to insert fake data into CourseGraph. As such, if your CourseGraph instance is accessible by the public, then **all Neo4j credential sets should be treated as production secrets**.\n\nBy default, this plugin initializes Neo4j with one user, whose username is ``neo4j`` and whose password is set from the ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` Tutor setting. When CMS pushes data to Neo4j, it also authenticates with ``neo4j`` as its username and ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` as its password. Keep in mind that:\n\n* If the ``neo4j`` user is destroyed, CMS will be unable to dump new data to Neo4j until a new ``neo4j`` user is created.\n* Once CourseGraph is initialized, changing ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` alone does not update the ``neo4j`` user's password. You will need to use ``CALL dbms.security.changePassword(...)`` from the Neo4j Web console for the password change to take effect.\n\nFinally, initializing CourseGraph with ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` set to ``!!null`` disables authentication entirely. Anyone with access to CourseGraph will have full read and write access to the Neo4j database. Obviously, this is only suitable when CourseGraph endpoint access is restricted to trusted private network.\n\n.. _Procedures for native user management: https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.5/authentication-authorization/native-user-role-management/procedures/\n\n\n.. _Configuration:\n\nConfiguration\n*************\n\nThe Tutor plugin can be configured with several settings. The names of all settings below are prefixed with ``COURSEGRAPH_``.\n\n.. list-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - **CourseGraph Setting**\n     - **Type**\n     - **Default**\n     - **Description**\n   * - ``NEO4J_PASSWORD``\n     - str\n     - (20 random characters)\n     - *Initial* password set for ``neo4j`` user, as well as password used to by CMS to authenticate as ``neo4j`` user. See `Managing Users`_ for more details.\n   * - ``NEO4J_VERSION``\n     - str\n     - ``\"3.5.28\"``\n     - Version of Neo4j to use. Appended to default image. Overriding ``NEO4J_DOCKER_IMAGE`` annuls this setting.\n   * - ``NEO4J_DOCKER_IMAGE``\n     - str\n     - ``\"docker.io/neo4j:3.5.28\"``\n     - Neo4j Docker image to be pulled and used. By default, based on your ``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` and ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_VERSION``.\n   * - ``NEO4J_HOST``\n     - str\n     - Prod: ``\"coursegraph.www.openedx.com\"``, Dev: ``\"coursegraph.local.overhang.io\"``\n     - Hostname of CourseGraph. By default, based on your ``LMS_HOST``.\n   * - ``DUMP_COURSE_ON_PUBLISH``\n     - bool\n     - ``true``\n     - Should CMS automatically dump a course to CourseGraph whenever it's published? If disabled, you will instead need to periodically dump courses via the management command or admin console.\n   * - ``RUN_NEO4J``\n     - bool\n     - ``true``\n     - Whether the Neo4j service should be started. Only disable if you wish to manage your own Neo4j instance outside of Tutor. If you disable this, then set ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_HOST`` to the hostname of your self-managed instance, set ``COURSEGRAPH_NEO4J_PASSWORD`` to the password of your instance's ``neo4j`` user, and expose port 7687 for unencrypted Bolt traffic.\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nUpgrade version pins::\n\n  make upgrade\n\nRun just static checks::\n\n  make test-format test-lint test-types\n\nRun all tests::\n\n  cp $(tutor config printroot)/config.yml tutor_config.bak.yml\n  make test  # clobbers some Tutor configuration\n  mv tutor_config.bak.yml $(tutor config printroot)/config.yml  # restore original config\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis software is licensed under the terms of the AGPLv3.\n\n\n",
