    "description": "# Graphsite\nGraphsite is a software written in Python that reads a pocket (in .mol2) and compute its graph representation. In each generated graph, each atom represents a node. If the distance between two atoms are less than or equal to a threshold (default is 4.5 Angstrom), an undirected edge is formed between these two atoms. The edge attribute is the number of chemical bond(s) on this edge.\n\n## Intallation\n```\npip install graphsite\n```\n\n## Usage\nGraphsite is invented for applications which are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the scope of this tool is not limited to deep graph learning. It can be used in any application that requires graph representaions of proteins/binding sites.  \n\n### Basic usage\nThe main module of Graphsite is a callable class which reads 3 files as input:\n```python\nfrom graphsite import Graphsite\n\ngraphsite = Graphsite()\nnode_feature, edge_index, edge_attr = pocket_to_graph(\n        # path to the .mol2 file of pocket\n        mol_path=mol_path, \n\n        # path to the .profile file of pocket which\n        # contains the sequence entropy node feature\n        profile_path=profile_path, \n\n        # path to the .popsa file of pocket which contains\n        # the solvent-accessible surface area node feature\n        pop_path=pop_path\n    )\n```\nThe ```node_feature```, ```edge_index```, and ```edge_attr``` are numpy arrays. For more information about input paramters and output formats, see help:\n```\n```\n\n### A Pytorch example\nBelow is an example where the output matrices of graphsite are used to create graphs for [Pytorch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n```python\nfrom torch_geometric.data import Data\n\ndata = Data(\n    x=node_feature,\n    edge_index=edge_index,\n    edge_attr=edge_attr)\n)\n```\nFor a complete deep learning example, please see [Graphsite-classifier](https://github.com/shiwentao00/Graphsite-classifier), where we build a graph classifier over 14 classes of binding pockets.\n\n## Cite our work\nPlease cite our paper if you find this package useful in your project :)\n```\nCurrently under peer review\n```\n\n## Feedback\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please submit an issue or pull request. Anyone is welcome to contribute :)",
