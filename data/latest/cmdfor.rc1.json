    "description": "===============================\ncmdfor\n===============================\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/jwgalley/cmdfor.svg\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/jwgalley/cmdfor\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cmdfor.svg\n        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmdfor\n\n\nnd for every line of input\n\n* Free software: MIT license\n* Documentation: (COMING SOON!) https://cmdfor.readthedocs.org.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nA shell utility (and package) which runs a command for every line of input.\n\nIt allows for spawning an arbitrary number of concurrent threads, and control\nover where to keep each commands output.\n\nIn my daily work, I have to run all manner of commands on huge batches of\nitems. These things are usually not CPU bound, so it makes sense to\nmultithread these tasks.\n\nThus, I find myself doing bash commands such as the following, which takes an\ninput file of items, splits it into equal(ish) parts, and then spawns a worker\nfor each part, all the while keeping granular logs and return codes::\n\n    lines=`wc -l domains.txt | awk '{print $1}'`; threads=10; split=$(((lines/threads)+1)); mkdir -p in out; split -d -l ${split} domains.txt in/part. ; ls in/ | while read -r f; do cat in/${f} | while read -r d; do host -t a \"${d}\" > out/${d} 2>&1; echo -e \"${d}\\t$?\"; done > log.${f} & echo ${!}; done > pids\n\nThat gets pretty tiring to type all the time. Why not use ``xargs -P`` you say?\nWell that works perfectly fine for cases where I don't need to make very\ncomplicated commands, and don't need to log all return codes. Maybe I can do\nall of that with ``xargs``, but I wanted to make this anyway as a learning\nexperience.\n\nHow-To\n------\n\nThe program can take input from STDIN or from a file passed with the -i option.\n\nAll arguments that aren't options are considered the subcommand to run. All\nwildcards ``{}`` are replaced with the corresponding positional field from the\ninput data.\n\nTo delete a list of files, basically the same behaviour as xargs::\n\n    cat files.txt | cmdfor rm {}\n\nTo run the fictional command ``imaplogin`` for every line of a csv that\ncontains <email>,<password> fields, logging each individual command's output\nto an file in the directory ./out::\n\n    cat email_users.csv | cmdfor -d, -o ./out -- imaplogin -u {} -p {}\n\nTo look up the IP addresses of a huge amount of hostnames, using 10 concurrent\nthreads, and storing each individual commands stdout and stderr in seperate\nfiles in the directory ./results, with each file being named after the hostname\non which the query was performed::\n\n    cat hostnames.txt | cmdfor -t 10 -Eo ./results -l 1 -- host -t a {}\n\n\nTo-Do\n-----\n\n1. Come up with a real test case. Since this is a shell utility and really only\ndeals with shell subcommands, I don't know what will work and what won't on\ntravis.ci (can I run a shell command there?)\n2. By default, it suppresses all output from subprocesses, and writes a message\nto STDOUT for each process spawn and reap. This output is too verbose for the\ndefault behaviour, and so it should be toggled with -v. The default should be\nquitier and simpler. Perhaps just the returncodes of each task.\n3. Refactoring some stuff to be a little less messy. The function signatures\nare huge, and there are messages generated in odd places. I think it would be\nbetter to pass a context object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n2018-04-09  v0.1.0  initial release, still need to do tests and docs\n2018-04-10  v0.1.5  fixing import issues and removing <2.7 support\n\n\n",
