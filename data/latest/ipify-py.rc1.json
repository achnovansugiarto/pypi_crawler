It's fast, simple, scalable, open source, and well-funded (*by me!*).\n\nIn short: if you need a way to pragmatically get your public IP address, ipify\nis the best possible choice!\n\nThis library will retrieve your public IP address from ipify's API service, and\nreturn it as a string.  It can't get any simpler than that.\n\nThis library also has some other nice features you might care about:\n\n- If a request fails for any reason, it is re-attempted 3 times using an\n  exponential backoff algorithm for maximum effectiveness.\n- This library handles exceptions properly, and usage examples below show you\n  how to deal with errors in a foolproof way.\n- This library only makes API requests over HTTPS.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install ``ipify``, simply run:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install ipify\n\nThis will install the latest version of the library automatically.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUsing this library is very simple.  Here's a simple example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from ipify import get_ip\n    >>> ip = get_ip()\n    >>> ip\n    u'96.41.136.144'\n\nNow, in regards to exception handling, there are several ways this can fail:\n\n- The ipify service is down (*not likely*), or:\n- Your machine is unable to get the request to ipify because of a network error\n  of some sort (DNS, no internet, etc.).\n\nHere's how you can handle all of these edge cases:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from ipify import get_ip\n    from ipify.exceptions import ConnectionError, ServiceError\n\n    try:\n        ip = get_ip()\n    except ConnectionError:\n        # If you get here, it means you were unable to reach the ipify service,\n        # most likely because of a network error on your end.\n    except ServiceError:\n        # If you get here, it means ipify is having issues, so the request\n        # couldn't be completed :(\n    except:\n        # Something else happened (non-ipify related). Maybe you hit CTRL-C\n        # while the program was running, the kernel is killing your process, or\n        # something else all together.\n\nIf you want to simplify the above error handling, you could also do the\nfollowing (*it will catch any sort of ipify related errors regardless of what\ntype they may be*):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from ipify import get_ip\n    from ipify.exceptions import IpifyException\n\n    try:\n        ip = get_ip()\n    except IpifyException:\n        # If you get here, then some ipify exception occurred.\n    except:\n        # If you get here, some non-ipify related exception occurred.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: regardless of how you decide to handle exceptions,\nthe ipify library will retry any failed requests 3 times before ever raising\nexceptions -- so if you *do* need to handle exceptions, just remember that retry\nlogic has already been attempted.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThis project is only possible due to the amazing contributors who work on it!\n\nIf you'd like to improve this library, please send me a pull request! I'm happy\nto review and merge pull requests.\n\nThe standard contribution workflow should look something like this:\n\n- Fork this project on Github.\n- Make some changes in the master branch (*this project is simple, so no need to\n  complicate things*).\n- Send a pull request when ready.\n\nAlso, if you're making changes, please write tests for your changes -- this\nproject has a full test suite you can easily modify / test.\n\nTo run the test suite, you can use the following commands:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install -e .\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ python setup.py test\n\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\nAll library changes, in descending order.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.1\n*************\n\n**Released January 26, 2022.**\n\n- Improving test to actually validate IP addresses.  Thanks to `@lethargilistic\n  <https://github.com/lethargilistic>`_ for the pull request!\n- Fixing URLs in the README / comments to point to https URLs.  Thanks to\n  `@ktdreyer <https://github.com/ktdreyer>`_ for the pull request!\n- Fixing typo in the README.  Thanks `@prologic <https://github.com/prologic>`_\n  for the find!\n- Adding a working test for exercising ``ServiceError`` exceptions.  Improves\n  test coverage a bit =)\n- Removing unnecessary assertions / tests.\n- Adding test to improve test coverage to 100% =)\n- Fixing minor style issues.  I'm really obsessed with code style / quality,\n  don't judge me!\n- Adding Python 3.5 / 3.6 support.\n- Adding Python 3.10 support.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.0\n*************\n\n**Released May 6, 2015.**\n\n- First release!\n\n\n",
