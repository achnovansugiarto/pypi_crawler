    "description": "Just Another (Django) Blog\n==========================\n\nYes, it's another Django blog.  Not a blogging framework, though -- just a blog.\nNo bells or whistles.  Designed to just get up and running with a basic blog as\nquickly as possible.  No comments, no categories, no tagging.  Themes are all\ntemplate-based.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n* You'll need Django installed, and some way of hosting it -- the default\n  runserver, Apache with mod_wsgi, or (of course) a\n  [PythonAnywhere](http://www.pythonanywhere.com) account.\n* You'll also need the\n  [South Django migrations package](http://south.aeracode.org/): if you're on\n  PythonAnywhere, you'll have it already. If not, `pip install south`.\n* `git checkout git://github.com/resolversystems/jab.git`\n* `cd jab`\n* `cp local_settings_template.py local_settings.py`\n* Edit `local_settings.py`, and change the variables in there to point to an\n  appropriate database etc.  The Twitter and email fields are optional, just\n  miss them out if you don't want to use them.\n* `python manage.py syncdb`\n* `python manage.py migrate`\n\n...and you're done!  Log in to the admin GUI using the admin username you\ncreated during the syncdb, and add `Post` objects to post; set the status to\n\"Published\" when you want a post to go live.  Posts `contents` are written\nin [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  It's worth\nnoting that you can just put any HTML in there too -- it'll get passed straight\nthrough.  So, for example, YouTube embed code will work just fine unchanged.\n\nIf you want to add something to the header (like, say, an \"About\" page) then set\nthe \"Link from header\" checkbox to true -- and you might want to also set the\n\"Show in list and rss\" checkbox to false.\n\nIf you want something to appear in a sidebar (the default template puts it on\nthe right) then just add a `SidebarItem` object; its `contents` field is also\nwritten in Markdown.\n\nA neat hack -- if you use Google Analytics and want to put the code in your\nblog, you can just create a new `SidebarItem` with the embed code in it -- it\nwill work!",
