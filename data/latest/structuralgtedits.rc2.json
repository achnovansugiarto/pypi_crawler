    "description": "StructuralGT: An automated python package for graph theory analysis of structural networks.\n\nDesigned for processing digital micrographs of complex network materials.\n\nFor example, analyzing SEM images of polymer network.\n\n\nStructuralGT is designed as an easy-to-use python-based application for applying graph theory (GT) analysis to \nstructural networks of a wide variety of material systems. This application converts digital images of \nnano-/micro-/macro-scale structures into a GT representation of the structure in the image \nconsisting of nodes and the edges that connect them. Fibers (or fiber-like structures) are taken to represent edges, \nand the location where a fiber branches, or 2 or more fibers intersect are taken to represent nodes. The program \noperates with a graphical user interface (GUI) so that selecting images and processing the graphs are intuitive and \naccessible to anyone, regardless of programming experience.  Detection of networks from input images, the extraction of \nthe graph object, and the subsequent GT analysis of the graph is handled entirely from the GUI, and a PDF file with the\nresults of the analysis is saved.  Also see StructuralGT_RC for added Ricci Curvature analysis.\n\n\nSee the README for detail information.\n\nhttps://github.com/drewvecchio/StructuralGT\n\nCopyright (C) 2021, The Regents of the University of Michigan.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
