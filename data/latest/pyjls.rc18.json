However, we could not identify a solution that met these\r\nrequirements.  [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) meets the\r\nlarge storage requirements, but not the reliability and rapid load requirements.\r\nThe [Saleae binary export file format v2](https://support.saleae.com/faq/technical-faq/binary-export-format-logic-2)\r\nis also not suitable since it buffers stores single, contiguous blocks.\r\n[Sigrok v2](https://sigrok.org/wiki/File_format:Sigrok/v2) is similar.\r\nThe [Sigrok v3](https://sigrok.org/wiki/File_format:Sigrok/v3) format\r\n(under development as of Feb 2022) is better in that it stores sequences of\r\n\"packets\" containing data blocks, but it still will does not allow for\r\nfast seek or summaries.\r\n\r\nTimeseries databases, such as [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), are \r\npowerful tools.  However, they are not well-designed for fast sample-rate\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nMedia containers are another option, especially the ISO base media file format\r\nused by MPEG4 and many others:\r\n  * [ISO/IEC 14496-14:2020 Specification](https://www.iso.org/standard/79110.html)\r\n  * [Overview](https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-4/iso-base-media-file-format)\r\n\r\nHowever, the standard does not included the ability to store the signal summaries\r\nand our specific signal types.  While we could add these features, these formats\r\nare already complicated, greatly reducing the advantage of repurposing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why JLS v2?\r\n\r\nThis file format is based upon JLS v1 designed for\r\n[pyjoulescope](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope) and used by the\r\n[Joulescope](https://www.joulescope.com/) test instrument.  We are leveraging\r\nthe lessons learned from v1 to make v2 better, faster, and more extensible.\r\n\r\nThe JLS v1 format has been great for the Joulescope ecosystem and has\r\naccomplished the objective of long data captures (days) with fast\r\nsampling rates (MHz).  However, it now has a long list of issues that are difficult\r\nto address without a significant restructuring.  The issues include:\r\n\r\n- Inflexible storage format (always current, voltage, power, current range, GPI0, GPI1).\r\n- Unable to store from multiple sources.\r\n- Unable to store other sources and signals.\r\n- No annotation support: \r\n  [41](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/41),\r\n  [93](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/93).\r\n- Inflexible user data support.\r\n- Inconsistent performance across sampling rates, zoom levels, and file sizes: \r\n  [48](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/48),\r\n  [103](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/103).\r\n- Unable to correlate sample times with UTC:\r\n  [55](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui/issues/55).\r\n\r\nThe JLS v2 file format will address all of these issues, dramatically \r\nimprove performance, and add new capabilities, such as signal compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nAt its lowest layer, JLS is an enhanced \r\n[tag-length-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value) (TLV)\r\nformat. TLV files form the foundation of many reliable image and video formats, \r\nincluding MPEG4 and PNG.  The enhanced header contains additional fields\r\nto speed navigation and improve reliability.  The JLS file format calls \r\neach TLV a **chunk**.  The enhanced tag-length component the **chunk header**\r\nor simply **header**.  The file also contains a **file header**, not to be \r\nconfused with the **chunk header**.  A **chunk** may have zero payload length,\r\nin which case the next header follows immediately.  Otherwise, a \r\n**chunk** consists of a **header** followed by a **payload**. \r\n\r\nThe JLS file format defines **sources** that produce data.  The file allows\r\nthe application to clearly define and label the source.  Each source\r\ncan have any number of associated signals.\r\n\r\n**Signals** are 1-D sequences of values over time consisting of a single,\r\nfixed data type.  Each signal can have multiple **tracks** that contain\r\ndata associated with that signal. The JLS file supports two signal types: \r\nfixed sample rate (FSR) and variable sample rate (VSR).  FSR signals\r\nstore their sample data in the FSR track using FSR_DATA and FSR_SUMMARY.\r\nFSR time is denoted by samples using timestamp.  FSR signals also support:\r\n\r\n* Sample time to UTC time mapping using the UTC track.\r\n* Annotations with the ANNOTATION track. \r\n\r\nVSR signals store their sample data in the VSR track.  VSR signals\r\nspecify time in UTC (wall-clock time).  VSR signals also\r\nsupport annotations with the ANNOTATION track.\r\nThe JLS file format supports VSR signals that only use the \r\nANNOTATION track and not the VSR track.  Such signals are commonly \r\nused to store UART text data where each line contains a UTC timestamp. \r\n\r\nSignals support DATA chunks and SUMMARY chunks.\r\nThe DATA chunks store the actual sample data.  The SUMMARY chunks\r\nstore the reduced statistics, where each statistic entry represents\r\nmultiple samples.  FSR tracks store the mean, min, max, \r\nand standard deviation.  Although standard deviation requires the\r\nwriter to compute the square root, standard deviation keeps the\r\nsame units and bit depth requirements as the other fields.  Variance\r\nrequires twice the bit size for integer types since it is squared.\r\n\r\nBefore each SUMMARY chunk, the JLS file will contain the INDEX chunk\r\nwhich contains the starting time and offset for each chunk that \r\ncontributed to the summary.  This SUMMARY chunk enables fast O(log n)\r\nnavigation of the file.  For FSR tracks, the starting time is \r\ncalculated rather than stored for each entry.\r\n\r\nThe JLS file format design supports SUMMARY of SUMMARY.  It supports\r\nthe DATA and up to 15 layers of SUMMARIES.  timestamp is given as a\r\n64-bit integer, which allows each summary to include only 20 samples\r\nand still support the full 64-bit integer timestamp space.  In practice, the\r\nfirst level summary increases a single value to 4 values, so summary\r\nsteps are usually 50 or more.\r\n\r\nMany applications, including the Joulescope UI, prioritize read performance,\r\nespecially visualizing the waveform quickly following open, \r\nover write performance.   Waiting to scan through a 1 TB file is not a \r\nvalid option.  The reader opens the file and scans for sources and signals.\r\nThe application can then quickly load the highest summary of summaries \r\nfor every signal of interest.  The application can very quickly display this\r\ndata, and then start to retrieve more detailed information as requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example file structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nsof\r\nheader\r\nUSER_DATA(0, NULL)    // Required, point to first real user_data chunk\r\nSOURCE_DEF(0)         // Required, internal, reserved for global annotations\r\nSIGNAL_DEF(0, 0.VSR)  // Required, internal, reserved for global annotations\r\nTRACK_DEF(0.VSR)\r\nTRACK_HEAD(0.VSR)\r\nTRACK_DEF(0.ANNO)\r\nTRACK_HEAD(0.ANNO)\r\nSOURCE_DEF(1)         // input device 1\r\nSIGNAL_DEF(1, 1, FSR) // our signal, like \"current\" or \"voltage\"\r\nTRACK_DEF(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_HEAD(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DEF(1.ANNO)\r\nTRACK_HEAD(1.ANNO)\r\nTRACK_DEF(1.UTC)\r\nTRACK_HEAD(1.UTC)\r\nUSER_DATA           // just because\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0)\r\nTRACK_SUMMARY(1.FSR, lvl=1)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0)\r\nTRACK_SUMMARY(1.FSR, lvl=1)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_DATA(1.FSR)\r\nTRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0)\r\nTRACK_SUMMARY(1.FSR, lvl=1)\r\nTRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=1)\r\nTRACK_SUMMARY(1.FSR, lvl=2)\r\nUSER_DATA           // just because\r\neof\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that TRACK_HEAD(1.FSR) points to the first TRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0) and\r\nTRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=1). \r\nEach TRACK_DATA( is in a doubly-linked list with its next and previous\r\nneighbors.  Each TRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0) is likewise in a separate doubly-linked\r\nlist, and the payload of each TRACK_INDEX points to the summarized TRACK_DATA\r\ninstances.  TRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=1) points to each TRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=0) instance.\r\nAs more data is added, the TRACK_INDEX(1.FSR, lvl=1) will also get added to\r\nthe INDEX chunks at the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n* JLS v1: \r\n  [lower-layer](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope/blob/master/joulescope/datafile.py),\r\n  [upper-layer](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope/blob/master/joulescope/data_recorder.py).\r\n* [Sigrok/v3](https://sigrok.org/wiki/File_format:Sigrok/v3), which shares\r\n  many of the same motivations.\r\n* Tag-length-value: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value).\r\n* Doubly linked list: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list).\r\n",
