Simply set it up to run under cron or\nanother job scheduler (sold separately), point it at a compatible e-mail\nsending service (also sold separately), and you'll get periodic e-mails listing\nnew events.\n\nInstallation & Setup\n====================\n``reponews`` requires Python 3.7 or higher.  Just use `pip\n<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install\n``reponews`` and its dependencies::\n\n    python3 -m pip install reponews\n\nBefore running ``reponews`` for the first time, you need to `acquire a GitHub\npersonal access token`__ for fetching details about your repositories via the\nGitHub GraphQL API, and you need to create a configuration file containing, at\na minimum:\n\n__ https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data\n   -secure/creating-a-personal-access-token\n\n- The access token or the path to a file containing it\n- The e-mail address that ``reponews`` should send its reports to\n- Details on how to send those e-mails\n\nAn example configuration file, for sending e-mails to luser@example.com with\nthe ``sendmail`` command:\n\n.. code:: toml\n\n    [reponews]\n    recipient = \"luser@example.com\"\n    auth-token = \"...\"\n\n    [outgoing]\n    method = \"command\"\n    command = [\"sendmail\", \"-i\", \"-t\"]\n\nSee \"`Configuration`_\" below for details.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nAn example of the sort of e-mail that ``reponews`` might send you::\n\n    [luser/my-repo] ISSUE #42: I found a bug (@bug-finder)\n    <https://github.com/luser/my-repo/issues/42>\n\n    @bug-fixer forked luser/my-repo\n    <https://github.com/bug.fixer/my-repo>\n\n    [luser/my-repo] PR #43: I fixed that bug (@bug-fixer)\n    <https://github.com/luser/my-repo/pull/43>\n\n    ★ @repo-fan starred orgcorp/bigrepo\n\n    [orgcorp/bigrepo] DISCUSSION #123: How do I use this?

Here are some changes you'll find:\n    >\n    > * Added a feature\n    > * Fixed a bug\n\n    Now tracking repository luser/brand-new-repo\n    <https://github.com/luser/brand-new-repo>\n    > This is the repository description.\n\n    No longer tracking repository tmprepos/deleted-repo\n\n    Repository renamed: team-member/new-project → theteam/new-project\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n::\n\n    reponews [<options>]\n\nThe ``reponews`` command queries GitHub's GraphQL API for new issues, pull\nrequests, discussions, releases, tags, stargazers, and/or forks on the\nrepositories specified in its configuration file (by default, all repositories\naffiliated with the authenticated user) and composes & sends an e-mail listing\nthe events in chronological order.  Also included in the report are\nnotifications about newly-tracked and -untracked repositories and renamed\nrepositories.  If there is no new activity, no e-mail is sent.\n\n\"New\" activity is, in the general case, anything that has happened since the\nlast time ``reponews`` was successfully run (specifically, since the last time\nthe state file was updated).  The first time ``reponews`` is run, it merely\nreports all the repositories that it is now tracking.  If ``reponews`` stops\ntracking a repository (usually because the repository listing in the config\nfile was edited) and then starts tracking it again, it will *not* pick up where\nit left off; instead, when it first starts tracking the repository again, it\nwill mark down that point in time and afterwards only report events occurring\nafter it.  Similar behavior occurs if ``reponews`` stops tracking a certain\ntype of activity and then starts tracking it again.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n-c PATH, --config PATH          Specify the configuration file to use.  See\n                                \"`Configuration`_\" below for the default config\n                                file location.\n\n--dump-repos                    Instead of fetching repository activity, dump\n                                the set of tracked repositories and their\n                                configured activity preferences as a JSON\n                                document\n\n-E FILE, --env FILE             Load environment variables from the given\n                                ``.env`` file.  By default, environment\n                                variables are loaded from the first file named\n                                \"``.env``\" found by searching from the current\n                                directory upwards.\n\n-l LEVEL, --log-level LEVEL     Set the log level to the given value.  Possible\n                                values are \"``CRITICAL``\", \"``ERROR``\",\n                                \"``WARNING``\", \"``INFO``\", \"``DEBUG``\" (all\n                                case-insensitive) and their Python integer\n                                equivalents.  [default: ``WARNING``]\n\n--print                         Cause ``reponews`` to output the e-mail (as a\n                                MIME document) instead of sending it\n\n--print-body                    Cause ``reponews`` to output the body of the\n                                e-mail instead of sending it\n\n--save, --no-save               Update/do not update the state file on\n                                successful completion [default: ``--save``]\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n``reponews`` is configured via a `TOML <https://toml.io>`_ file whose default\nlocation depends on your OS:\n\n=======  ==================================================================\nLinux    ``~/.local/share/reponews/config.toml``\n         or ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/reponews/config.toml``\nmacOS    ``~/Library/Application Support/reponews/config.toml``\nWindows  ``C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\jwodder\\reponews\\config.toml``\n=======  ==================================================================\n\nThis TOML file must contain a ``[reponews]`` table with the following keys &\nsubtables (all of which are optional unless stated otherwise).  Unknown keys\nresult in an error.\n\n``recipient`` : e-mail address\n    [Required when ``--print-body`` is not given] The e-mail address to which\n    ``reponews`` should send its reports.  This can be either a plain e-mail\n    address (e.g., ``\"me@example.com\"``) or a display name with an address in\n    angle brackets (e.g., ``\"Madam E <me@example.com>\"``).  Note that, if the\n    display name contains any punctuation, it needs to be enclosed in double\n    quotes, which then need to be escaped for use in the TOML string, e.g.,\n    ``\"\\\"Joe Q.  Recipient\\\" <jqr@example.net>\"``.\n\n``sender`` : e-mail address\n    The ``From:`` address to put on ``reponews``'s e-mails; specified the same\n    way as ``recipient``.  If ``sender`` is not specified, it is assumed that\n    the e-mail sending mechanism will automatically fill in the ``From:``\n    address appropriately.\n\n``subject`` : string\n    The subject to apply to ``reponews``'s e-mails; defaults to \"[reponews] New\n    activity on your GitHub repositories\".\n\n``auth-token`` : string\n    The GitHub OAuth token/personal access token to use for interacting with\n    the GitHub API.  If ``auth-token`` is not set, the token will be read from\n    the file specified by ``auth-token-file``; if that is also not set, the\n    environment variables ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` and ``GH_TOKEN`` will be consulted\n    for the token, in that order.  Environment variables can be either set\n    directly in the environment or else read from a ``.env`` file (See the\n    ``--env`` option under \"Options_\" above).\n\n``auth-token-file`` : path\n    The path to a file containing the GitHub OAuth token/personal access token\n    to use for interacting with the GitHub API.  The file must contain only the\n    token and possibly leading and/or trailing whitespace.\n\n    The path may start with a tilde (``~``) to indicate a file in the user's\n    home directory.  A relative path will be resolved relative to the directory\n    containing the config file.\n\n``state-file`` : path\n    The path to the file where ``reponews`` will store repository activity\n    state, used to determine the cutoff point for new activity.  The path may\n    start with a tilde (``~``) to indicate a file in the user's home directory.\n    A relative path will be resolved relative to the directory containing the\n    config file.\n\n    The default location for the state file depends on your OS:\n\n    =======  =================================================================\n    Linux    ``~/.local/state/reponews/state.json``\n             or ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/reponews/state.json``\n    macOS    ``~/Library/Application Support/reponews/state.json``\n    Windows  ``C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\jwodder\\reponews\\state.json``\n    =======  =================================================================\n\n``api-url`` : URL\n    The GraphQL endpoint to query; defaults to \"https://api.github.com/graphql\"\n\n``activity`` : table\n    A subtable describing what types of repository activity to fetch & track.\n    This table may contain the following keys:\n\n    ``issues`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new issues in tracked repositories; defaults to true\n\n    ``pull-requests`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new pull requests in tracked repositories; defaults\n        to true\n\n    ``discussions`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new `discussions`_ in tracked repositories; defaults\n        to true\n\n    ``releases`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new releases in tracked repositories; defaults to\n        true\n\n    ``tags`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new tags in tracked repositories; defaults to true\n\n    ``released-tags`` : boolean\n        This setting controls how to handle tags that are also made into\n        releases when both tags and releases are being tracked.  If true, such\n        tags are reported separately from the releases.  If false (the\n        default), such tags are not reported.\n\n    ``stars`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new stargazers for tracked repositories; defaults to\n        true\n\n    ``forks`` : boolean\n        Whether to report new forks of tracked repositories; defaults to true\n\n    ``my-activity`` : boolean\n        When false (the default), activity performed by the authenticated user\n        is not reported.\n\n    ``affiliated`` : table\n        A subtable describing what types of repository activity to fetch &\n        track for repositories affiliated with the authenticated user.  The\n        table's keys are the same as the boolean keys of\n        ``[reponews.activity]``.\n\n    ``repo`` : table\n        A subtable describing what types of repository activity to fetch &\n        track for specific repositories or repositories belonging to a given\n        user/organization.  The keys of the subtable must be of the form\n        ``\"owner/name\"`` (for a specific repository) or ``\"owner/*\"`` (for all\n        repositories belonging to a given user/organization), and the values\n        must be subtables with the same boolean keys as\n        ``[reponews.activity]``.\n\n        By default, all repositories and repository owners listed as keys in\n        ``[reponews.activity.repo]`` will be tracked by ``reponews`` just as if\n        they were listed under ``reponews.repos.include`` (see below).  This\n        can be disabled for a single key by setting ``include = false`` in the\n        key's subtable.\n\n    When determining the activity to fetch & track for a repository\n    ``owner/name``, each setting is looked up in the relevant tables in the\n    following order, from highest precedence to lowest precedence:\n\n    1. ``[reponews.activity.repo.\"owner/name\"]``\n    2. ``[reponews.activity.repo.\"owner/*\"]``\n    3. ``[reponews.activity.affiliated]`` (if the repository is affiliated with\n       the authenticated user)\n    4. ``[reponews.activity]``\n\n``repos`` : table\n    A subtable describing what repositories to track.  This table may contain\n    the following keys:\n\n    ``affiliations`` : list of strings\n        A list of repository affiliations describing which repositories\n        associated with the authenticated user should be automatically tracked.\n        The affiliations are ``\"OWNER\"`` (for tracking repositories that the\n        user owns), ``\"ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\"`` (for tracking repositories\n        belonging to an organization of which the user is a member), and\n        ``\"COLLABORATOR\"`` (for tracking repositories to which the user has\n        been added as a collaborator).  Unknown affiliations result in an\n        error.  When ``affiliations`` is not specified, it defaults to all\n        affiliation types.\n\n    ``include`` : list of strings\n        A list of repositories to track in addition to affiliated repositories.\n        Repositories can be specified as either ``\"owner/name\"`` (for a\n        specific repository) or ``\"owner/*\"`` (for all repositories belonging\n        to a given user/organization).\n\n    ``exclude`` : list of strings\n        A list of repositories to exclude from tracking, specified the same way\n        as for ``include``.  This option takes precedence over the\n        ``affiliations`` and ``include`` settings.\n\n.. _discussions: https://docs.github.com/en/discussions\n\n\nExample Configuration\n---------------------\n\n.. code:: toml\n\n    [reponews]\n    recipient = \"luser@example.com\"\n\n    sender = \"RepoNews Bot <reponews@example.net>\"\n\n    # Fetch the GitHub OAuth token from the \"token.txt\" file next to the config\n    # file:\n    auth-token-file = \"token.txt\"\n\n    state-file = \"~/.cache/reponews.json\"\n\n    [reponews.activity]\n    # Don't report new issues or tags:\n    issues = false\n    tags = false\n\n    [reponews.activity.affiliated]\n    # Do report new issues for affiliated repositories:\n    issues = true\n\n    [reponews.activity.repo.\"pypa/*\"]\n    # Don't report forks of pypa/* repositories:\n    forks = false\n    # Don't track all pypa/* repositories; only track those we're affiliated\n    # with and those listed under `reponews.repos.include`.\n    #\n    # Without this setting, the presence of `[reponews.activity.repo.\"pypa/*\"]`\n    # would cause reponews to track all repositories belonging to the pypa\n    # organization.\n    include = false\n\n    [reponews.repos]\n    affiliations = [\"OWNER\", \"ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\"]\n    include = [\n        \"pypa/packaging\",\n        \"pypa/pip\",\n        \"pypa/setuptools\",\n        \"some-user/*\",\n    ]\n    exclude = [\n        \"some-user/boring-repo\",\n    ]\n\n\nSending E-Mail\n==============\n\n``reponews`` uses outgoing_ for sending e-mail, allowing it to handle multiple\nsending methods like sendmail, SMTP, and more.  The `outgoing configuration`_\ncan be located in the ``reponews`` configuration file (as an ``[outgoing]``\ntable) or in ``outgoing``'s default configuration file.  See `outgoing's\ndocumentation <https://outgoing.rtfd.io>`_ for more information.\n\n.. _outgoing: https://github.com/jwodder/outgoing\n\n.. _outgoing configuration:\n   https://outgoing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html\n",
