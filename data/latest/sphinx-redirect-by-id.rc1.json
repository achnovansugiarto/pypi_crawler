    "description": "# Redirect By ID for Sphinx\n\nThis extension originated as part of the discussion in\nhttps://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9574.\n\nWhen building a Sphinx project into HTML, the permalinks on entities still\ncontains the specific page the entity is located on, along with the ID of the\nentity. If the pages are later restructured and entities are moved to different\npages, the old permalinks will be dead.\n\nThis extension adds a new page `redirect.html` which can be given an ID. The\npage will use the existing search index of the project to redirect to the page\nwhere the entity is located.\nFor example, if you have a page `api.html` where a Python function `f` is\ndocumented, then its permalink may be `https://example.com/api.html#f`. If you\nthen browse to `https://example.api.html?q=f` you will be redirected to \n`https://example.com/api.html#f`.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install the extension:\n\n     python3 -m pip install sphinx-redirect-by-id\n\n2. Add it to `conf.py`:\n\n   ```py\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx_redirect_by_id',\n   ]\n   ```\n",
