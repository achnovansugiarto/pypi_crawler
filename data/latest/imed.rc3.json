It solves some of the shortcommings of using the  pixel-wise Euclidean distance in classification or regression problems. Small displacements do not have as large an impact on the similarity measure when IMED is used over the ED. \n\nBelow, two binary 2D images are displayed, each in two versions. One image has white pixels that are _slightly displaced_ compared to the other.\nWith the original 'sharper' images, the ED between these two images is large, since ED does not take into account any surroundings of each pixel. This is despite the obvious similarity to the naked eye. The 'blurred' versions are standardizing transformed (ST) with a certain Gaussian filter. The displacement is not penalized as harshly by the ED on these images. \n\n**This is the IMED: The Euclidean distance evaluated on ST-images.**\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfelding/IMED/assets/readme_assets/L2_images/L2_imgs.png\" alt=\"Forward transform of 2D images alter the L2 distance, reduces noise\" width=\"500px\" style=\"horisontal-align:middle\">\n</p>\n\n## The IMED package\nThis package contains efficient python implementations of the IMED (distance, transforms) and adds robust inverse transforms for first-ever utility in regression problems e.g. spatio-temporal forecasting.\n\n`imed.legacy` contains legacy transforms, i.e. slower or less useful versions of the IMED, for historical reasons.\n\nImplementations are based on and extend the work of [On the translation‑invariance of image \ndistance metric](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40535-015-0014-6.pdf) [1].\n\nThe ST is a convolution-based transformation. This package therefore implements the transforms in frequency space. Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) methods are available, with slightly different edge effects as a result. The DCT is recommended for natural images since it performs _symmetric convolution_. The frequency-based methods allow parallelization and distributed computations if needed.\n\nIn the future, an even more efficient finite-support version of the transforms will be added (see [this issue](https://github.com/jfelding/IMED/issues/1))\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Classification\nIn [On the Euclidean distance of images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1453520) [2] the IMED was presented for ED-compatible classification and clustering methods. These only require a 'forward' transform to perform computations on the altered data set or images. \n\nMethods include: Any classification method applying an 'L2 loss function', Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), SVMs, Neural Networks, k-nearest neighbours, clustering methods.\n\n### Regression Problems\nThis package extends the IMED to use in regression problems. These problems require the default forward ST to be performed on the dataset. This is used an input in a predictor model that uses L2 loss (traditionally), and the predictions are 'blurred' like the augmented dataset. These predictions may not be satisfactory. \n\nThe inverse ST is used in this case, and called like:\n\n```python\nfrom imed import transform\n\n# forward transform\nimg_ST = transform(img,sigma=2, eps=1e-2, inv=False)\n\n# any L2 loss prediction method with image output\nimg_predicted_ST = predict(img_ST) \n\n# sharpen prediction using backwards/inverse ST\nimg_predicted = transform(img_predicted_ST, sigma=2, eps=1e-2, inv=True)\n```\nThe `eps` parameter is crucial in both the forward and backwards pass and must have the same value small, positive value in the two. Problems for which the inverse transform is not needed do not require `eps` to be non-zero. `eps` allows robust deconvolution. If it is not used, the inverse predictions may completely unusable due to noise amplification in inverse filtering.  \n\nBelow is an example of restoring a forward ST transformed sequence (right) to one that is almost identical to the original image in the sequence (left).\nThe forward transform had non-zero sigma only along the temporal axis in which the 'L2' motif moved around along the spatial axes.\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfelding/IMED/assets/readme_assets/L2_inverse_temporal_transform/l2_inverse_temporal.png\" alt=\"Restoration using inverse standardizing transform along temporal axis.\" width=\"750px\" style=\"horisontal-align:middle\">\n</p>\n\n\n### _n_-Dimensional Problems\nThe standardizing transform is a convolution-based method. It can therefore is sensible to perform it along any axes of correlation, and this is implemented by `imed.transform`. \n\nIn some problems, e.g. spatio-temporal ones, it is often advisable to use _different_ valStandardizingues of the Gaussian 'blurring parameter' `sigma` along some axes (time vs. spatial axes). For n-dimensional volumes for which the same value e.g. `sigma = 1` must not be used, an array-like `sigma` can be passed with axis-per-axis values.  `sigma = [0., 1., 1.]` may be proper for a 3D data volume (T, M, N) of T images. `sigma = [0.5., 1., 1.]` may be used for 'blurring' along the temporal axis, too.\n\n## Tunable Parameters\n\n* **`sigma`**: (int or array-like) Gaussian 'blurring' parameter (real-space interpretation). If int: ST uses same `sigma` value along all axes. If 0: ST is skipped along that axis (array-like argument). Each value of `sigma` defines a new IMED loss function. _IMED loss values should not be compared using different values of sigma_.\n* **`inv`**:  (bool.) Whether to perform the forward (False) transform or backwards (True). Other parameters should be matched when an inverse transform is required following the forward ST.\n* **`eps`** Should only be used when an inverse transform is required. In these case, use the same, small value of `eps` in the forward and backwards transforms.\n\n\n## Getting Started with the Standardizing Transform\n### Installation\nInstall the latest release from pypi:\n\n`pip install imed`\n\n### Image and Volume Standardizing Transforms\nThe standardizing transform as pictured in the introduction is easily computed for a single image, image sequence or general data volume.\nThe easiest way to get started is to run:\n\n```python\nimed.transform(volume, sigma, inv=False, eps=1e-2, method=\"DCT\")\n```\n\nThe function outputs a volume with the same shape that has been transformed according to the selected arguments.\n\nIn _regression problems_ the IMED is utilized as a loss function by transforming the data using a forward ST-transform with e.g. `eps=1e-2` (robustly). The prediction method is then applied to the transformed data, and outputs such 'blurred' predictions.\nWhen these are achived, the predictions can be 'unblurred' by performing the _inverse transform_:\n\n```python\nimed.transform(volume, sigma, inv=True, eps=1e-2, method=\"DCT\")\n```\n\nWhen one expects that an inverse transform of 'blurred' predictions will be necessary, the **same values of `eps` should be chosen in the forward and backwards standardizing transforms!** `eps = 0` should be chosen when an inverse transform is not needed.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->Distance Calculation\n\nTo compute the IMED score between two volumes, one may compute:\n\n```python\nimed.distance(volume1, volume2, sigma=1)\n```\n\nThe two data volumes must have identical shape. It may be a single image, a collection of images, or a high-dimensional volume. See the docstring for more details. The function allows the computation of a single volume-wide similarity score, or an array of similarity scores to be computed.\n\nThe function first performs the standardizing transform on the data volumes and compares the transformed volumes using the ED afterwards.\n\n\n## Parallelization of frequency methods and backend change\nThe IMED methods are implemented using the `scipy.fft` module.\nBy chopping up the transforms into smaller chunks, SciPy supports parallelization by specifying the _workers_ environment variable:\n    \n\n```python\nfrom scipy import fft\n\nwith fft.set_workers(-1):\n    imgs_ST = imed.transform(volume, sigma)\n```\n\nWhen the number of workers is set to a negative integer (like above), the number of workers is set to os.cpu_count().\n\nSciPy also supports computations using another backend. For example, we can use [pyFFTW](http://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as backend like so: \n     \n```python\n from scipy import fft\n import pyfftw\n\n with fft.set_backend(pyfftw.interfaces.scipy_fft):\n    \n    #faster if we enable cache using pyfftw\n    pyfftw.interfaces.cache.enable()\n    \n    # perform standardizing transform using frequency method of your choice\n    imgs_ST = imed.transform(volume, sigma)\n```\n\n## References\n[1] [Bing Sun, Jufu Feng, and Guoping Wang. “On the Translation-Invariance of Image\nDistance Metric”.
