    "description": "# crashbang\nA tool to aid in testing the stability of programs\n\nCrashbang is a tool that allows you to easily run a program through several \niterations, speeding up the process of testing a program's stability. It also \ngathers data about the iterations and can provide statistics about successful \nexits versus crashes. Data is presented upon test run completion and program \noutput can be saved to a file for later analysis. There are also facilities for \nlimited automated testing.\n\nCrashbang is essentially a beefed up loop. It runs a program through the \nspecified number of iterations and detects what status the program exited with. \nNon-zero exit status constitutes an error, so those are flagged as failures, \nwhile zero is counted as a success. If a timeout is specified and the program \ndoesn't exit before the timeout is reached, crashbang will automatically close \nthe program and the iteration is counted as a success. Crashbang can also detect \ncrashed caused by a signal (e.g. SIGIOT, Segmentation faults, etc.) and will \ndisplay the recieved signal in the output file. \n\n## Usage\nBasic usage is to prepend `crashbang` to the program you want to run. This will \nrun through 10 iterations of the program, waiting for the program to naturally \nterminate before proceeding to the next one. \n\n```\ncrashbang program-name\n```\n\n### Adding Arguments\nArguments to pass to the tested program are specified using the -a flag, and \nmust be wrapped in quotation marks.\n\n```\ncrashbang program-name -a \"--first-argument --second-argument=true\"\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### Iterations\nCrashbang supports any number of iterations. Iterations can be set using the \n`-i` flag. The default number of iterations is 10.\n\n```\ncrashbang program-name -i 100\n```\n\n#### Timeout\nA timeout can also be specified. This is helpful when creating large automated\ntesting runs. With the timeout specified, Crashbang waits for natural program \ntermination up to the specified timeout. If the timeout is reached, the program \nis stopped and the iteration is counted as a success, then a new iteration is \nstarted. If the program exits with 0 prior to the timeout, the iteration is also \nconsidered successful. Crashes before the timeout are still treated as failures, \nand if the program exits for any reason before the timeout is reached, the \nremainder of the timeout is skipped and the next iteration begins immediately.\n\nTimeouts can be specified in seconds with the '-t' flag:\n\n```\ncrashbang program-name -t 10\n```\n\n## Output\nUpon completion or termination of a test run, Crashbang will display the \ngathered statistics from the test run, including the program name, the total \nnumber of iterations, the number of successful iterations, the number of crashes \ndetected, and the failure percentage. \n\nCrashbang currently handles the KeyboardInterrupt exception to allow it to \ndisplay statistics for completed iterations if the user uses Ctrl-C to exit the \ntest run early. The output will reflect the total number of completed iterations \nin addition to the successes and crashes. \n\n### Output File\nCrashbang also outputs a file with the console output (stdout and stderr) of any \nfailed iterations. It also outputs the iteration number and the exit status ( or \nsignal, if the termination was caused by a signal). \n\n\n## Planned Features\nThe following features are currently not implemented, but are planned for \ninclusion:\n\n* Performance/timing information\n* Status and ETA for completion of a test run\n* Expanded output control\n* Hooks for other automated testing tools\n",
