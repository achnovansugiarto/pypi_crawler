    "description": "# cacholote\n\nEfficiently cache calls to functions\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```python\n>>> import cacholote\n>>> cacholote.config.set(cache_db_urlpath=\"sqlite://\")\n<cacholote.config.set ...\n\n>>> @cacholote.cacheable\n... def now():\n...     import datetime\n...     return datetime.datetime.now()\n\n>>> now() == now()\nTrue\n\n>>> with cacholote.config.set(use_cache=False):\n...     now() == now()\nFalse\n\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration settings can be accessed using `cacholote.config.get()` and modified using `cacholote.config.set(**kwargs)`. It is possible to use `cacholote.config.set` either as a context manager, or to configure global settings. See `help(cacholote.config.set)`.\n\nDefaults are controlled by environment variables and dotenv files. See `help(cacholote.config.reset)`.\n\n## Workflow for developers/contributors\n\nFor best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. DEVELOP) with Python 3.10:\n\n```\nconda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.10\nconda activate DEVELOP\n```\n\nBefore pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:\n\n1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`\n1. Install this package: `pip install -e .`\n1. Sync with the latest [template](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/cookiecutter-conda-package) (optional): `make template-update`\n1. Run quality assurance checks: `make qa`\n1. Run tests: `make unit-tests`\n1. Run the static type checker: `make type-check`\n1. Build the documentation (see [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/)): `make docs-build`\n\n## License\n\n```\nCopyright 2019, B-Open Solutions srl.\nCopyright 2022, European Union.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
