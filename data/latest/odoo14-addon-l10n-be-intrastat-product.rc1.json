Arrivals : Exempt, Standard or Extended\n  - Dispatches : Exempt, Standard or Extended\n  - Default Intrastat Region\n  - Default Intrastat Transaction\n  - Default Intrastat Transport Mode (Extended Declaration)\n  - Default Intrastat Incoterm (Extended Declaration)\n\n* Warehouse\n\n  Intrastat Region to cope with warehouses in different regions\n\n* Inrastat Codes, Supplementary Units, Transaction Tyoes, Transport Modes, Regions\n\n  Cf. menu Accounting / Configuration / Intrastat\n\n  The configuration data is loaded when installing the module.\n  We recommend no to change these settings.\n\n  A configuration wizard also allows to update the Intrastat Codes so that you can easily\n  synchronise your Odoo instance with the latest list of codes supplied with this module\n  (an update is published on an annual basis by the Belgian National Bank).\n\n* Product\n\n  You can define a default Intrastat Code on the Product or the Product Category.\n\n* Fiscal Positions\n\n  Check your Fiscal Positions and set the 'Intrastat' flag for transactations that\n  must be included in the intrastat declaration.\n  We recommend to set the 'VAT required' flag on the 'Intra Community Regime' Fiscal Position.\n\n  If you have B2C customers or B2B customers which are not subject to VAT you can create a\n  'Intra Community Regime NA' Fiscal Position on which the 'Intrastat' flag is set while the 'VAT required'\n  flag has been turned off.\n\n* Partner\n\n  Ensure that your B2B Customer records have a valid VAT Number.\n\n  Consider the use of the OCA **account_fiscal_position_vat_check module** to enforce the correct setting.\n  Cf. https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools.\n\n  If you have not set the 'Detect Automatically' flan on your Intra Community Fiscal Position(s) than you should\n  set the 'Intra Community Regime NA' Fiscal Position on B2B customer records who are not subject to VAT.\n  Alternatively you can also set 'NA' in the VAT number field of such a customer.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* The current version of the Belgian Intrastat reporting module is only based on invoices.\n  Since associated stock moves are not taken into consideration, it is possible that manual\n  corrections are required, e.g.\n  Product movements without invoices are not included in the current version\n  of this module and must be added manually to the report lines\n  before generating the ONEGATE XML declaration.\n\n* Refunds on invoices within the same reporting period are deducted from the declaration lines.\n  No controls are executed on Refunds that are not linked to an invoice\n  in the same reporting period.\n  Such Refunds are reported under the default transaction code for refunds.\n  It is recommend to manually set the correct transaction code while Credit Notes\n  are created.\n\n* The current version of the Belgian Intrastat reporting module does not perform a\n  cross-check with the VAT declaration.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nThis module is also available for olders Odoo versions:\n\n- Odoo 12.0 -
