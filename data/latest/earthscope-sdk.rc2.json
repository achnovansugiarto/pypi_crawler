    "description": "# EarthScope SDK\n\nAn SDK for authenticating with the EarthScope API\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### USAGE\n\n1. **(Optional) Suggest setting up and activating a python virtual environment so as not to clutter your system python**\n\n   ```shell\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   . venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Install earthscope-sdk**\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install earthscope-sdk\n   ```\n   For developers:\n   ```bash\n   pip -e install earthscope-sdk[dev]\n   ```\n   \n3. **Create/Use required subclasses**\n   \\\n   To use the **Device Authorization Flow** you will need to create a subclass of the DeviceCodeFlow class. Similarly, to use\n   the **Machine-to-Machine Client Credentials Flow** you will need to create a subclass of the ClientCredientialFlow class.\n\n   Simple subclasses exist for your use that you can import and use which will allow for locally loading and saving access tokens:\n   *DeviceCodeFlowSimple* and *ClientCredentialsFlowSimple* (see below for examples on useage)\n   <br/><br/>\n   Creating your own subclass:\n    \\\n   Implementing the following methods in the subclass is required:\n   * `load_tokens` should implement the ability to load saved tokens\n   * `save_tokens` should implement the ability to save tokens locally\n   \n   additionally for DeviceCodeFlow only:\n   * `prompt_user` should provide the user with the SSO authorization uri\n\n   You will need to instantiate your subclass with the following instance attributes:\n\n   For DeviceCodeFlow:\n   * `audience`, `domain`, `client_id`, and `scope`.\n\n   For ClientCredentialsFlow:\n   * `audience`, `client_credentials`, and `domain`.\n   \n      where client_credentials contains the machine-to-machine `client_id` and `client_secret`.\n\n   These values are all obtained from [Auth0](https://manage.auth0.com/).\n   <br/><br/>\n4. **Use the SDK**\n   \\\n   You can now use the subclasses to define actions such as logging in/out, retrieving or refreshing access tokens, etc...\n   \\\n   **NOTE: Never share your access token or refresh tokens**\n   \n   Additionally, once the subclasses have been instantiated, you can pass your access token as a parameter to retrieve\n   your user/anonymous user information using the earthscope_sdk.user.user *get_user* and *lookup_anon* functions.\n  \n \n5. **Example useages:**\n   \\\n   Note: To see an example of an application using this SDK (and creating custom subclass), check out the [EarthScope CLI Repository](https://gitlab.com/earthscope/public/earthscope-cli).\n   <br/><br/>\n   How to use the existing simple subclass for device code flow:\n   \\\n   *simple example python code*:\n    ```\n    import requests\n    from pathlib import Path\n     \n    from earthscope_sdk.auth.device_code_flow import DeviceCodeFlowSimple\n    from earthscope_sdk.auth.auth_flow import NoTokensError\n    \n   # choose where you want the token saved - the default file name is sso_tokens.json\n   # if you want to keep the default name, set the path to a directory. Include a file name to rename. \n   token_path = \"/Users/my_user/token_dir\"\n   \n   url = \"https://data-idm.unavco.org/path/to/data_file\"\n   # example: \"https://data-idm.unavco.org/archive/gnss/rinex/obs/2022/298/ar272980.22d.Z\"\n   \n    # instantiate the device code flow subclass\n    device_flow = DeviceCodeFlowSimple(Path(token_path))\n    try:\n        # get access token from local path\n        device_flow.get_access_token_refresh_if_necessary()\n    except NoTokensError:\n        # if no token was found locally, do the device code flow\n        device_flow.do_flow()\n    token = device_flow.access_token\n     \n    # request a file and provide the token in the Authorization header\n   file_name = Path(url).name\n   directory_to_save_file = Path.cwd() # where you want to save the downloaded file \n   \n    r = requests.get(url, headers={\"authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\"})\n    if r.status_code == requests.codes.ok:\n        # save the file\n        with open(Path(directory_to_save_file / file_name), 'wb') as f:\n            for data in r:\n                f.write(data)\n    else:\n        #problem occured\n        print(f\"failure: {r.status_code}, {r.reason}\")\n     ```\n   \n   Instantiate the subclass and set the token_path where you want to load/save the token. \n   If you provide only a directory, the file will be saved as sso_tokens.json. \n   We hard-code this variable in this simple example, but we recommend setting this path as an environment variable and \n   reading the environment varibale in your code.\n\n\n   the **get_access_token_refresh_if_necessary** method will retrieve the token and refresh the token if it is expired. \n   If there is no token, then the **do_flow** method will begin the device code flow and once you complete the flow, \n   the token will be saved at the token_path. You can use the **requests** library to download the file you want \n   (or files in a loop) and pass in the access token in the Authorization header. \n   \nLearn more about [data access methods](https://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/data-access-methods/data-access-methods.html).\n",
