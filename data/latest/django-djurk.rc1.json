    "description": "djurk\n=====\n(pronounced: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jerk#Pronunciation)\n\nThe *djurk* project is a Django app that interfaces with and uses *Amazon's\nMechanical Turk* Service as a requester (http://mturk.com/). If you're just\nstarting to use *Mechanical Turk*, and want to try it out without getting bogged\ndown with the APIs, this **will be** (but isn't yet) a great place to\nstart.\n\nOver time, you will grow your skills, learn about the *Boto* project\n(http://code.google.com/p/boto/) which is a python interface to *Mechanical\nTurk* and many more *Amazon Web Services* (AWS). At that point, you may say\n\"Wait!?!  Most of this work has been done by *Amazon* and the *Boto* project.\nThis is nothing but a set of wrappers and high level libraries that let me\naccess this data without having to go too deep.\" You would be right. Until\nthen, \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.\"[1]\n\nThe *djurk* project is currently in the pre-alpha stage. This means that,\nuntil this note is changed, this project is not any more helpful than using\n*Boto* to create a few Django models, wade through the Amazon\nDocumentation yourself (http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/mturk/) and get\nwhat you need done. The goal is to present this in a Django specific way so\nthat you as a reader can \"plug and play\" without getting bogged down much with\nthe implementation specifics. Because documentation and clear/predictable\ndesign are the two most important factors to make this happen and \"fit in your\nbrain,\" this can always be more challenging than it seems. Until then, consider\nthis a pipedream (That is; bookmark it and come back later).\n\nWhy make this so public if it's little more than a few README files? Because\ntransparency is good. A lot can grow from a little seed like this is now.\n\nGet started with Quick Start Guide:\n[https://github.com/glenjarvis/djurk/wiki/Quick-Start](https://github.com/glenjarvis/djurk/wiki/Quick-Start)\n\n[1] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/quotes",
