It currently only supports AMQP 0-9-1 and integrates with the\nZope Tool Kit (ZTK) so you can use adapters, utilities and all the buzz.\n\n.. contents:: :depth: 1\n\n\nBasic concepts and terms\n========================\n\n* A *message handler* is a function which is bound with a routing key to\n  exactly one queue. It is called for each message on that queue, and may\n  return a list of messages as a result.\n\n* The result messages of one handled message are sent in one transaction\n  together with the ACK of the handled message.\n\n* When an exception is raised during message processing, the transaction is\n  aborted. (The received message would be NACKed if RabbitMQ was supporting\n  it.)\n\n* A message handler handles exactly one message at a time. Multiple messages\n  can be processed at the same time using multiple processes. (Each process is\n  single-threaded.)\n\n\nThings you don't need to take care of\n=====================================\n\n* Socket handling and locking for communicating with the AMQP broker\n\n* Transaction handling\n\n* Message ids\n\n  * Each outgoing message gets an email-like message id.\n\n  * The correlation id of each outgoing message is set to the message id of\n    the incoming message.\n\n  * Each outgoing message gets a custom references header which is set to the\n    incoming message's reference header plus the incoming message's message\n    id.\n\n\nGetting started: receiving messages\n===================================\n\nTo get started, define a function which does the work. In this example, we log\nthe message body and send a message. The ``declare`` decorator takes two\narguments, the queue name and the routing key (you can also pass in a list to\nbind the function to multiple routing keys). The ``declare`` decorator also\nsupports an optional ``arguments`` argument that is a dictionary to be passed\nto the AMQP queue_declare call to, e.g., support mirrored queues on RabbitMQ.\nThe optional argument ``principal`` specifies to wrap the handler call into a\nzope.security interaction using the given principal id (you need the\n``[security]`` setup.py extra to use this integration functionality).\n\n::\n\n    import logging\n    import gocept.amqprun.handler\n    import gocept.amqprun.message\n\n    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    @gocept.amqprun.handler.declare('test.queue', 'test.routing')\n    def log_message_body(message):\n        log.info(message.body)\n        msg = gocept.amqprun.message.Message(\n            header=dict(content_type='text/plain'),\n            body=u'Thank you for your message.',\n            routing_key='test.thank.messages')\n        return [msg]\n\n\nThe handler function needs to be registered as a named utility. With ZCML this\nlooks like this [#grok]_::\n\n    <configure xmlns=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/zope\">\n      <utility component=\"your.package.log_message_body\" name=\"basic\" />\n    </configure>\n\nTo set up a server, it's recommended to create a buildout. The following\nbuildout creates a config file for ``gocept.amqprun`` as well as a ZCML file\nfor the component configuration and uses ZDaemon to daemonize the process::\n\n    [buildout]\n    parts =\n            config\n            zcml\n            app\n            server\n\n    [deployment]\n    name = queue\n    recipe = gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox\n    root = ${buildout:directory}\n\n    [config]\n    recipe = lovely.recipe:mkfile\n    path = ${deployment:etc-directory}/queue.conf\n\n    amqp-hostname = localhost\n    amqp-username = guest\n    amqp-password = guest\n    amqp-virtualhost = /\n\n    eventlog =\n        <eventlog>\n          level DEBUG\n          <logfile>\n            formatter zope.exceptions.log.Formatter\n            path STDOUT\n          </logfile>\n        </eventlog>\n    amqp-server =\n        <amqp-server>\n          hostname ${:amqp-hostname}\n          username ${:amqp-username}\n          password ${:amqp-password}\n          virtual_host ${:amqp-virtualhost}\n        </amqp-server>\n\n    content =\n        ${:eventlog}\n        ${:amqp-server}\n        <worker>\n          component-configuration ${zcml:path}\n        </worker>\n        <settings>\n          your.custom.settings here\n        </settings>\n\n    [zcml]\n    recipe = lovely.recipe:mkfile\n    path = ${deployment:etc-directory}/queue.zcml\n    content =\n        <configure xmlns=\"http://namespaces.zope.org/zope\">\n          <include package=\"your.package\" />\n        </configure>\n\n    [app]\n    recipe = zc.recipe.egg:script\n    eggs =\n       gocept.amqprun\n       your.package\n       zope.exceptions\n    arguments = '${config:path}'\n    scripts = server=app\n\n    [server]\n    recipe = zc.zdaemonrecipe\n    deployment = deployment\n    program = ${buildout:bin-directory}/app\n\n\n.. [#grok] It's likely that there will be a special ZCML statement and/or grok\n   support to make registering of handlers easier.\n\n\nSending messages\n================\n\nIf all you want to do is send messages, you don't have to register any\nhandlers, but can use ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server.send()`` directly. While\nthe handlers usually run in their own process, started by the ``server``\nentrypoint (as described above), if you're just sending messages, you can also\nskip the extra process and run the ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server`` in your\noriginal process. Here is some example code to do that::\n\n    def start_server(**kw):\n        server = gocept.amqprun.server.Server(kw, setup_handlers=False)\n        server.connect()\n        return server\n\n(When you're using the ZCA, you'll probably want to register the ``Server`` as\na utility at that point, too, so clients can access it to send messages\neasily.)\n\n\nSettings\n========\n\nFor application-specific settings gocept.amqprun makes the ``<settings>``\nsection from the configuration available via an ``ISettings`` utility::\n\n    settings = zope.component.getUtility(\n        gocept.amqprun.interfaces.ISettings)\n    settings.get('your.settings.key')\n\n\nLimitations\n===========\n\n* Currently all messages are sent and received through the `amq.topic`\n  exchange. Other exchanges are not supported at the moment.\n\n\nInterfacing with the file system\n================================\n\nReading\n-------\n\nThere is a ``send_files`` entrypoint in the setup.py. It can be configured with\nthree arguments: The path of the zconfig file, a watch path and a routing key.\nIt reads new files in the directory named ``new`` in the watch path and sends\na message with its content as the body and the filename as an X-Filename header\nto the route. Sent files are moved to the directory called ``cur`` in the\nwatch path.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nYou can set the AMQP server parameters for running the tests via environment\nvariables:\n\n:AMQP_HOSTNAME:\n    default: localhost\n\n:AMQP_USERNAME:\n    default: guest\n\n:AMQP_PASSWORD:\n    default: guest\n\n:AMQP_VIRTUALHOST:\n    default: None, so a vhost with a temporary name is created and\n    deleted automatically (using ``AMQP_RABBITMQCTL`` command)\n\n:AMQP_RABBITMQCTL:\n   default: 'sudo rabbitmqctl'\n\nThe source code is available in the mercurial repository at\nhttps://github.com/gocept/gocept.amqprun\n\nPlease report any bugs you find at\nhttps://github.com/gocept/gocept.amqprun/issues\n\n\nbin/test_sender and bin/test_server\n-----------------------------------\n\n``test_sender`` and ``test_server`` are scripts that provide basic sender and\nhandler capabilities to smoke test the behaviour of our current implementation.\nWhen started ``test_sender`` emits 10 messages routed to ``test.routing``.\n``test.server`` declares a ``test.queue`` which all messages from\n``test.routing`` are sent to and a handler logging every incoming message from\n``test.queue``.\n\nbin/test_send_files\n-------------------\n``test_send_files`` starts a server that watches the ./testdir/new directory\nand sends files copied into it as an amqp message to ``test.routing``. Its\nentrypoint is ``gocept.amqprun.readfiles:main``.\n\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n3.0 (2020-10-06)\n----------------\n\nBreaking changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.7.\n\n- Drop no longer used exception ``.interfaces.CounterBelowZero``.\n\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Retry errors which happen during a transaction.commit and are configured for\n  reraise.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.9.\n\n\n2.1 (2020-09-18)\n----------------\n\n- Let the Server exit in case of an ``socket.error``. We lost the re-connection\n  feature in 2.0 already.\n\n\n2.1a1 (2020-04-17)\n------------------\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.\n\n\n2.0 (2020-04-15)\n----------------\n\n- Add support for ``zope.interface >= 5``.\n  (`#13 <https://github.com/NativeInstruments/gocept.amqprun/pull/13>`_)\n\n- Change CI pipeline from Travis to GitHub Actions.\n\n\n2.0a1 (2020-03-20)\n------------------\n\nBreaking changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Use kombu/py-amqp instead of pika for basic abstraction over amqp methods.\n\n- Remove multithreading – servers and workers run in the current process.\n\n- Remove gocept.amqprun.main.main_server as main loop.\n\n- Remove ``configure.zcml`` and ``meta.zcml``.\n\n- Remove writing messages in files and the amqp:writefile directive.\n\n- Remove writefiles extra in setup.py.\n\n- Remove amqp:readfile zcml directive and add send_files entrypoint for\n  readfiles process. It takes three parameters: a configuration file path, a\n  watch directory path and a route to send the file to.\n  (see bin/test_send_files, details are in the README.rst).\n\n- Remove ``.channel.Channel`` and use ``amqp.channel.Channel`` instead.\n\n- Remove ``.interfaces.IChannelManager``.\n\n- Remove ``.interfaces.ProcessStarted``.\n\n- Remove ``.interfaces.ProcessStopping``.\n\n- Remove ``.connection.Connection`` and use ``kombu.Connection`` instead.\n\n- Rename conf key ``heartbeat_interval`` to ``heartbeat`` in zconfig\n  configuration.\n\n- Remove ``amount`` from worker zconfig.\n\n- Enforce content_encoding header for Message bodies that are unicode.\n\n- Rename ``.message.Message.header.headers`` to\n  ``.message.Message.header.application_headers``.\n\n- Rename ``.testing.ZCML_LAYER`` to ``.testing.ZCA_LAYER``.\n\n- Remove ``.testing.LoopTestCase``, use ``unittest.TestCase`` instead.\n\n- Remove ``.testing.MainTestCase.wait_for_response``, use ``wait_for_message``\n  instead.\n\n- Remove ``.testing.SettingsLayer`` as it is not used here.\n\n- Move ``.connection.Parameters`` to ``.server``, it now returns a dict.\n\nFeatures\n++++++++\n\n- Add ``bin/test_sender`` and ``bin/test_server`` scripts to smoke test sending\n  and receiving behaviour. See README.rst.\n\n- Add representation for ``.handler.Handler`` class.\n\n\n1.8 (2019-09-11)\n----------------\n\n- Update to current bootstrap.py\n\n- Improve forward compatibility with Python 3.\n\n- Fix deprecation warning.\n\n- Prevent using pytest >= 5 to keep Python 2 compatibility.\n\n- Migrate repository to github.\n\n\n1.7.1 (2016-08-22)\n------------------\n\n- Fix bug, when a string is passed as a port number to\n  ``gocept.amqprun.connection.Parameters``.\n\n\n1.7 (2016-05-31)\n----------------\n\n- Fix possible unresponsiveness of message handlers which occurred after an\n  exception in the worker. The exception caused a counter under-run which\n  prevents switching channels. The counter is no longer bound to the\n  transaction but to the message handling.\n\n- Add a save guard which kills the whole process if the reference counter on\n  the channel falls below zero.\n\n- Acquire the channel before putting a task to the worker queue to prevent a\n  possible race condition.\n\n- Release the commit lock if ``tpc_abort()`` fails. So the next ``tpc_begin()``\n  does not wait forever while trying to acquire the lock and thus blocking the\n  whole process.\n\n1.6 (2016-04-04)\n----------------\n\n- Allow arbitrary keywords in ``.testing.QueueTestCase.send_message()`` to be\n  passed to generated message.\n\n1.5 (2016-02-01)\n----------------\n\n- Add a ``testing`` extra which can be used to reuse the test infrastructure of\n  this package to develop tests on top of it.\n\n1.4 (2015-11-20)\n----------------\n\n- Acknowledge message in ``ErrorHandlingHandler`` on non recoverable error.\n  This got lost in 0.17.0.\n  Fixes: https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.amqprun/issue/5\n\n\n- The error message of ``ErrorHandlingHandler`` on a non recoverable error\n  references the original message using its correlation_id again.\n  This got lost in 0.17.0.\n  Fixes: https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.amqprun/issue/6\n\n\n1.3 (2015-09-11)\n----------------\n\n- Update the test infrastructure to be able to run with newer RabbitMQ versions\n  than 3.1.5.\n\n\n1.2 (2015-09-11)\n----------------\n\n- Add `py.test` as test runner.\n\n- Add `settings` attribute to `IHandler` to ease accessing `ISettings`.\n\n1.1 (2015-09-01)\n----------------\n\n- ``.connection.Parameters`` no longer accepts arbitrary keyword parameters.\n\n\n1.0 (2015-04-10)\n----------------\n\n- Notify ``IConfigFinished`` event after `gocept.amqprun` is fully configured\n  but before the workers are started. This event can be used to open database\n  connections for instance.\n\n- Bump version to 1.0 as this package is used in production for years.\n\n\n0.17.0 (2015-04-09)\n-------------------\n\n- Abort transaction in ``ErrorHandlingHandler`` on non recoverable error.\n  Fixes: https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.amqprun/issue/4\n\n\n0.16.0 (2015-03-25)\n-------------------\n\n- Raise ``RuntimeError`` if connection is not alive after connect. (This can\n  happen when the credentials are wrong.)\n\n\n0.15.2 (2015-02-24)\n-------------------\n\n- Fix error reporting in ``.testing.QueueLayer.rabbitmqctl()``.\n\n\n0.15.1 (2015-01-21)\n-------------------\n\n- Moved code to and bug tracker to Bitbucket_.\n\n.. _Bitbucket : https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.amqprun\n\n\n0.15.0 (2014-10-08)\n-------------------\n\n- Pretend to support savepoints so we can work together with other systems that\n  support (and require) them.\n\n\n0.14.0 (2014-09-09)\n-------------------\n\n- Introduce ``gocept.amqprun.handler.ErrorHandlingHandler`` base class.\n\n- Run integration tests (MainTestCase) in a separate ZCA, isolated from any\n  registrations that might have been done by other tests.\n\n- Create temporary virtualhost on the rabbitmq server per test run.\n\n- Improved test-case method ``send_message`` to take headers as a parameter.\n\n\n0.13.0 (2014-04-16)\n-------------------\n\n- Introduce ``IResponse`` for transaction-integrated exception handling.\n\n- Fix timing bug: when the remote side closes the socket and at the same time a\n  channel switch is triggered, this used to break down (since the socket is\n  closed). We now ignore the channel switch attempt and simply wait for the\n  reconnect, which opens a new channel anyway.\n\n\n0.12.2 (2014-02-20)\n-------------------\n\n- Add ``xfilename`` variable to the ``<amqp:writefiles pattern=\"\">`` setting.\n\n\n0.12.1 (2014-02-20)\n-------------------\n\n- Add safeguard that two handlers cannot bind to the same queue.\n\n\n0.12 (2014-02-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Include <amqp:writefiles> into the transaction handling, i.e. write to file\n  only on commit. Previously, when an error occurred e.g. inside the\n  MessageStored event, duplicate files would be written (each time the message\n  was processed again on retry after the error).\n\n\n0.11 (2014-01-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Crash the process on filesystem errors for <amqp:readfiles>. Previously only\n  the file reading thread crashed, but the process kept running, unaware that\n  it now was not doing its job anymore, since the thread had died.\n\n\n0.10 (2013-05-28)\n-----------------\n\n- Support more than one Server in a single process.\n\n- Introduce ``setup_handlers`` parameter for Server so clients can disable\n  setting up handlers.\n\n- Fix a bug in the <amqp:readfiles> transaction implementation that caused\n  crash when aborting a transaction (#12437).\n\n- Allow test server to take longer time for startup on slow computers.\n\n\n0.9.5 (2013-04-16)\n------------------\n\n- Refactor Session / DataManager responsibilities (#9988).\n\n\n0.9.4 (2012-09-07)\n------------------\n\n- Fix IDataManager implementation: abort() may be called multiple times,\n  regardless of transaction outcome. Only release the channel refcount once.\n\n\n0.9.3 (2012-09-07)\n------------------\n\n- Improve logging of IDataManager.\n\n\n0.9.2 (2012-09-07)\n------------------\n\n- Improve logging of IChannelManager.acquire/release.\n\n\n0.9.1 (2012-09-06)\n------------------\n\n- Fix IDataManager implementation: tpc_abort() may also be called without a\n  prior tpc_begin() (happens for errors in savepoints, for example).\n- Fix method signature of Connection.close().\n\n\n0.9 (2012-08-31)\n----------------\n\n- Introduce optional integration with zope.security: handlers can declare a\n  principal id with which an interaction will be created.\n- Use a separate channel for sending messages that are not a response to a\n  received message.\n- Introduce SETTINGS_LAYER for tests relying on ISettings.\n\n\n0.8 (2012-04-04)\n----------------\n\n- Fix race condition that caused messages to be acknowledged on a different\n  channel than they were received on (#10635).\n\n- Fix race condition that caused attempts at sending messages before the\n  server was started properly (#10620).\n\n\n0.7 (2012-03-22)\n----------------\n\n- Fix race condition between getting the current channel in the DataManager and\n  switching the current channel in the Server (#10521).\n- Make AMQP server configurable for tests (#9232).\n\n\n0.6.1 (2012-02-23)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed bug in creating references header when parent message has no references\n  (#10478).\n\n\n0.6 (2012-02-22)\n----------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Changed FileStoreReader from its own process to a thread that uses\n  gocep.amqprun for sending (previously it used amqplib). Introduced\n  ``amqp:readfiles`` ZCML directive. (#10177)\n\n- Changed `filestore` extra to `readfiles` extra.\n\n- Transmit filename as ``X-Filename`` header from ``amqp:readfiles``.\n\n- Introduced ``ISender`` utility.\n\nBugs\n~~~~\n\n- Fixed bug with acknowledging messages that was introduced in 0.5 (#10030).\n\nInternal\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Changed API for MainTestCase from ``create_reader`` to ``start_server``.\n\n\n0.5.1 (2012-01-09)\n------------------\n\n- Bugfix to support unicode arguments for queue declaration as pika\n  only supports bytestrings here.\n- Bugfix to make ``arguments`` parameter of ``amqp:writefiles`` work (#10115).\n\n\n0.5 (2011-12-08)\n----------------\n\nGeneral\n~~~~~~~\n\n- Added `writefiles` extra to make ZCML directive ``amqp:writefiles`` optional.\n\n- Added `filestore` extra to make ``gocept.amqprun.filestore`` optional.\n\n- Moved declaration of ``amqp:writefiles`` from ``configure.zcml`` to\n  ``meta.zcml``.\n\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Renamed ``gocept.amqprun.server.MessageReader`` into\n  ``gocept.amqprun.server.Server`` and added a ``send`` method so it can\n  initiate sending of messages.\n\n- Add support for arguments for queue_declare e.g to support x-ha-policy\n  headers for RabbitMQ mirrored queue deployments (#10036).\n\n\nInternal\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Internal API change in ``server.AMQPDataManager.__init__``: the `message`\n  parameter is now optional, so it was moved to the end of the list of\n  arguments.\n\n- Use plone.testing for layer infrastructure.\n\n\n0.4.2 (2011-08-23)\n------------------\n\n- Add helper methods for dealing with header files to FileWriter (for #9443).\n\n\n0.4.1 (2011-08-22)\n------------------\n\n- Log Message-ID.\n\n\n0.4 (2011-07-25)\n----------------\n\n- The message id of outgoing messages is set.\n- The correlation id of outgoing messages is set to the incoming message's\n  message id (if set).\n- A custom header ``references`` is set to the incoming message's reference\n  header + the incomming message's message id (like `References` in RFC5322).\n- Fixed broken tests.\n- Allow upper case in settings keys.\n- Extend AMQP server configuration for FileStoreReader to include credentials\n  and virtual host.\n- Allow specifying multiple routing keys (#9326).\n- Allow specifying a filename/path pattern (#9327).\n- The FileWriter stores the headers in addition to the body (#9328).\n- FileWriter sends IMessageStored event (#9335).\n\n\n0.3 (2011-02-05)\n----------------\n\n- Renamed decorator from ``handle`` to ``declare``.\n- Added helper method ``wait_for_response`` to MainTestCase.\n- Added an IProcessStarting event which is sent during startup.\n- Added the <amqp:writefiles/> directive that sets up a handler that writes\n  incoming messages into files.\n- Added handling of <logger> directives\n\n\n0.2 (2010-09-14)\n----------------\n\n- Added a decorator ``gocept.amqprun.handler.handle(queue_name, routing_key)``.\n\n\n0.1 (2010-08-13)\n----------------\n\n- first release.\n\n\n",
