It has been packaged for distribution via PyPi on launch.\n\n  1. install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)\n\n  2. install conda virtual environment and required packages\n      + Create an environment with: `conda create -n gap python==3.7 jupyter pip`  \n      + Activate: `source activate gap`\n      + `pip install gapml`\n\n      Dependencies for **Linux** or **Mac**:  \n      + Tesseract:    `conda install -c conda-forge tesseract`  \n      + Ghostscript:  `conda install -c conda-forge ghostscript`  \n      + Imagemagick:  `conda install -c conda-forge imagemagick`\n\n      Dependencies for **Windows** executables in the following links:  \n      + Ghostscript:  https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html  \n      + Imagemagick:  https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php  \n      + Tesseract:    https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki\n\n  3. exiting conda virtual environment:\n      + Windows: `deactivate`\n      + Linux/macOS: `source deactivate`\n\n## Setup.py Installation:\n\nTo install GapML via setup.py:\n\n  1. clone from the Github repo.  \n      + `git clone git@github.com:andrewferlitsch/Gap.git`\n\n  2. install the GapML setup file. \n      + `python setup.py install`\n\n## Modules\n\nThe framework provides the following pipeline of modules to support your data and knowledge extraction from both digital and scanned PDF documents, TIFF facsimiles and image captured documents.\n\n#### <span style='color: saddlebrown'>SPLITTER</span>\n\nThe splitter module is the NLP entry point into the pipeline. It consists of a Document and Page class. The Document class handles the splitting of PDF documents into PDF pages, TIFF facsimiles into TIFF pages, OCR and raw text extraction. PDF splitting and image extraction is handled by the open source Artifex’s Ghostscript ©, and TIFF splitting by open source Image Magic’s Magick ©. OCR is handled by the open source Google’s Tesseract ©. The Document object stores the individual PDF/TIFF/image pages and corresponding raw text and optionally page images (when scanned PDF, TIFF or images) in the specified storage path. The splitting process can be done synchronously or asynchronously, where in the latter case an event handler signals when the splitting/OCR has been completed and the page table is accessible.\n\nFor OCR, the resolution of the image extraction is settable, which will affect the quality of the OCR, and corresponding processing time. If the resolution of the original scanned page is lower than the setting, it will be up-sampled, and conversely if it is higher it will be down-sampled.\n\nThe Page class handles access to the individual pages, via the page table of the document class. Access is provided to the individual PDF, TIFF or image page, the scanned image (when scanned PDF, TIFF or images), raw text and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) processed tokens (when SYNTAX module is installed).\n\nNLP processing of the raw text is deferred until first access (JIT), and then preserved in memory as long as the corresponding page object is referenced. The NLP processed tokens may be further segmented into regions, consisting of tables, paragraphs, columns, etc. when the SEGMENTATION module is installed.\n\nThe document and corresponding pages may be classified (i.e., category of the content) when the CLASSIFICATION module is installed.\n\n[Specification](specs/splitter_spec.docx)\n\n#### <span style='color: saddlebrown'>SYNTAX</span>\n\nThe syntax module follows the splitter module in the pipeline. It consists of the Words and Vocabulary classes. The Words class handles natural language processing (NLP) of the extracted text. The NLP processing can be configured for tokenization, stemming, lemmatizing, stop word removal, syntax analysis and word classification, with Unicode support.\n\nThe word classifier recognizes:\n\n  - Syntax Units: Articles, Demonstratives, Prepositions, Pronouns, Conjunctions, Quantifiers, Questions\n  - Abbreviations\n  - Acronyms\n  - Gender (inclusive of Transgender)\n  - Date of Birth\n  - USA and Canadian Addresses\n  - USA and Canadian Telephone Numbers\n  - USA Social Security numbers\n  - USA and ISO Standard for Dates\n  - USA and ISO Standard for Numbers and units of measure.\n  - Geographic Locations\n  - Sentiment\n\nDates, numbers and units of measure can be converted to either USA Standard or ISO Standard.  USA and Canadian postal addresses are converted to the USPO standard for address matching.\n\nAlong with the builtin stemmer and lemmatizer, the module can optionally be configured to use the NLTK (open source) stemmers, lemmatizer and parts of speech annotations.\n\n[Specification](specs/syntax_spec.docx)\n\n\n#### <span style='color: saddlebrown'>SEGMENTATION</span>\n\nThe segmentation module was introduced as part of the pre-launch of Gap v0.9. It currently is in the demonstration stage, and not ready for commericial-product code ready. The segmentation module examines the whitespace layout of the text to identify 'human' layout of text and corresponding context, such as paragraphs, headings, columns, page numbering, letterhead, etc. The text is then separated into segments based on recognized layout and within the segments the text is NLP preprocessed. In this mode, the NLP preprocessed text is hierarchical. At the top level are the segments, with corresponding segment tag, and the child is the NLP preprocessed text within the segment.\n\n[Specification](specs/segment_spec.docx)\n\n#### <span style='color: saddlebrown'>VISION</span>\n\nThe splitter module is the CV entry point into the pipeline. It consists of a Images and Image class. The Images class handles the storage and (random access) batch retrieval of CV machine learning ready data, using open source openCV image processing, numpy high performance arrays (tensors) and HDF5 high performance disk (tensor) access. The Image class handles preprocessing of individual images into CV machine learning ready data. The batch and image preprocessing can be done synchronously or asynchronously, where in the latter case an event handler signals when the preprocessing of an image or batch has been completed and the machine learning ready data is accessible.\n\nThe vision module handles:\n\n  - Mixed image size, format, resolution, number of channels\n  - Decompression, Resizing, Normalizing, Flattening\n\n[Specification](specs/vision_spec.docx)\n\n## User's Guide\n\nThe User's (Programming) Quick Start Guide can be found [here](specs/quick%20start%20guide.docx)\n\n## Releases\n\n\n## Testing\n\nThe GAP framework is developed using Test Driven Development methodology. The automated unit tests for the framework use pytest, which is a xUnit style form of testing (e.g., jUnit, nUnit, jsUnit, etc).\n\n#### Installation and Documentation\n\nThe pytest application can be installed using pip:\n\n    pip install pytest\n\nOnline documentation for [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)\n\n#### Execution\n\nThe following are the pre-built automated unit tests, which are located under the subdirectory tests:\n\n    document_test.py    # Tests the Document Class in the Splitter Module\n    page_test.py        # Tests the Page Class in the Splitter Module\n    words_test.py       # Tests the Words and Addresses Class in the Syntax Module\n    segment_test.py     # Tests the Segment Class in the Segment Module\n    image_test.py       # Tests the Image and Images Class in the Vision Module\n\nThe automated tests are executed as follows:\n  \n  1. From directory root enter `cd tests`\n\n  2. Tests can be run by:\n\n    pytest -v document_test.py\n    pytest -v page_test.py\n    pytest -v words_test.py\n    pytest -v segment_test.py\n    pytest -v image_test.py\n\n#### Code Coverage\n\nInformation on the percent of code that is covered (and what source lines not covered) by the automated tests is obtained using pytest-cov. This version of pytest is installed using pip:\n\n    pip install pytest-cov\n\n  1. From directory root enter `cd tests`\n\n  2. To run tests with coverage: \n\n    pytest --cov=gapml.splitter document_test.py page_test.py\n\n        Statements=456, Missed=60, Percent Covered: 87%\n\n    pytest --cov=gampml.syntax words_test.py\n\n        Statements=456, Missed=60, Percent Covered: 93%\n\n    pytest --cov=gampml.address words_test.py\n\n        Statements=456, Missed=60, Percent Covered: 90%\n\n    pytest --cov=gampml.vision image_test.py\n\n        Statements=652, Missed=56, Percent Covered: 91%",
