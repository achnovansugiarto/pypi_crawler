    "description": "# φtorch: spark up your physics\n#### *utilities for computational physics based on PyTorch*\n\n---\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/phytorch?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/phytorch/)\n[![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/phytorch/badge/?version=latest)](https://phytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n![license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/phytorch)\n\n---\n\n`phytorch` (φtorch) is a package for doing physics using\n[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the backend for computations, which allows\nparallelisation on GPUs and automatic differentiation.\n[Check out the docs](https://phytorch.readthedocs.org) to see what's on offer!\n\n## Installation\n\nφtorch consists of Python modules and a PyTorch extension written in C++/CUDA.\nTherefore, installation has two steps, but should otherwise be fully automatic.\n\n1. First, clone (or download) the source code, then `cd` into the root directory\n    and run\n    ```shell\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n    This will automatically install the few dependencies and the pure-Python \n    code (in developer mode, which means that it won't be installed in the\n    `site-packages` but will run out of the current directory). If you are not\n    interested in special functions and differentiable cosmographic distances,\n    you’re good to go!\n   > **Note**\n   > In that case, you can also now install the pure-Python components from\n   > PyPI using\n   > ```shell\n   > pip install phytorch\n   > ```\n\n2. Then, to compile the extensions,\n    ```shell\n    cd phytorch-extensions\n    python setup.py build_ext\n    ```\n   > **Warning**\n   > *Building the extensions currently requires you to have a CUDA compiler,\n   > which, I realise, sucks. I’m working on making a cpu-only version possible.*\n\n    Finally, the extensions, which have now been built in a folder like\n    `phytorch-extensions/build/lib*`, need to be linked to `phytorch/extensions`:\n    ```shell\n    cd ../phytorch/extensions\n    ln -s ../../phytorch-extensions/build/lib*/* .\n    ```\n\n---\n*This program is free software and comes with no warranty except that which can\nbe reasonably expected of computer logic. It is, however, licensed under the\nGNU General Public Licence v3.0, which disallows closed source re-distribution\nand any such foul nonsense.*\n",
