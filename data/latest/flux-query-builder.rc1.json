    "description": "# Flux Query Builder\n\nVersion: 1.0.0\n\n\nA python querybuilder for the flux query language used by InfluxDB\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\n```shell\n$ pip install flux-query-builder\n ```\n\n ### Building Queries\n\n ```py\nfrom flux_query_builder import FluxQuery\nfrom flux_query_builder.utility import S\nimport flux_query_builder.functions as fn\n\t\nq = (\n\tFluxQuery() \n\t| fn.From(bucket=S(\"bucket-name\")) \n\t| fn.Range(start=S(\"-1d\"))\n\t| fn.AggregateWindow(every=S(\"30m\"),fn=fn.Mean)\n)\n\nprint(q.get_query())\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```flux\nfrom(bucket:\"bucket-name\")\n|> range(start: \"-1d\")\n|> aggregateWindow(every: \"30m\", fn: mean)\n```\n\n\n## Creating your custom Functions\n\nIt is sometimes usefull to create and save a custom function for later use\n\nFor most use cases the `InlineFn` class is sufficent if you want to do something more custom you can inherit the `FluxQueryFunction` class. \n\n```py\nfrom flux_query_builder.functions.base import FluxQueryFunction\nfrom flux_query_builder.functions import InlineFn\n\nclass MeasurementFilter(FluxQueryFunction):\n\n    name = \"measurementFilter\"\n    package=None\n\n    def __init__(self, measurement ):\n            super().__init__(measurement=measurement)\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        return f\"(r) => r._measurement == \\\"{self.params.get('measurement')}\\\")\"\n\n```\n\n## Fluid API\n\nThe FluxQuery class exposes all functions as it's own methods via a metaclass. Unfortunetly Intellisense is not aware of the methods but if you prefer, instead of using the pipe operator, you can use the Fluid API\n\n__Some functions in the flux langauge are python keywords because of this they are suffixed with a `_`__\n\n__The query will still throw if the required parameters are not given!__\n\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nq = (\n\tFluxQuery()\n\t.from_(bucket=\"bucket\", start=S(\"-30m\"))\n\t.filter(fn=\"(r) => r._measurement = 'meas'\")\n\t.count()\n)\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n### FluxQuery\n\nThe querybuilder class. FluxQueries are __immutable__ every operation like piping a new function with `|` or even adding an import creates a clone of the class\n\n### The `S` Utility Class\n\nSome times you want to add parameters to functions you pipe and want them to be strings. In that case the S class is a wrapper to add qoutes to the string\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nfrom flux_query_builder import FluxQuery\nfrom flux_query_builder.utility import S\nimport flux_query_builder.functions as fn\n\nq = FluxQuery()\n\nq = (\n\tq \n\t| fn.Filter(fn=\"(r) => r._measurement = 'meas'\")\n\t| fn.AggregateWindow(every=S(\"30m\"),fn=fn.Mean)\n)\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```flux\nfrom(bucket:\"bucket-name\")\n|> range(start: \"-1d\")\n|> aggregateWindow(every: \"30m\", fn: mean)\n```\n\nIn this case the `fn` argument will be taken as is and the `S(\"30m\")` will be in quoutes.\n\nThe rational behind this is that there still needs to be a way to add non string values\n\n\n### InlineFn\n\nA Utility class for creating inline functions like those in the filter function\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nfrom flux_query_builder.functions import InlineFn\nfrom flux_query_builder import FluxQuery\nfrom flux_query_builder.utility import S\n# Create a function that filters out all measurements that are not \"meas\"\nmeas_filter = InlineFn(\"r\", \"r._measurement == 'meas'\")\nprint(meas_filter)\n\nq = FluxQuery(bucket_name=\"bucket-name\", start=S(\"-1d\")) | fn.Filter(fn=meas_filter)\n\nprint(q.get_query())\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```flux\n(r) => r._measurement == 'meas'\n\nfrom(bucket:\"bucket-name\", start: \"-1d\")\n|> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == 'meas')\n```\n\n### FluxTime\n\nFlux time is a utlility class to deal with flux durations and dates and pythons datetimes and timedeltas\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nfrom flux_query_builder.utility import FluxTime\n\n# Create a flux duration\nduration = FluxTime(duration=\"1d\")\nprint(duration)\n\n\n# Create a flux duration from a timedelta\nduration = FluxTime(duration=timedelta(days=1))\nprint(duration)\n\n# Create a flux date from a datetime\ndate = FluxTime(date=datetime(2020,1,1))\nprint(date)\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```flux\n1d\n1d\n2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\n```\n\n\n### FilterBuilder\n\nThe FilterBuilder makes it easy building filters for your query by generating a InlineFunction that respects all the given conditions\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nfrom flux_query_builder import FluxQuery\nfrom flux_query_builder.utility import S\nfrom flux_query_builder.functions import FilterBuilder\nimport flux_query_builder.functions as fn\n\nq = FluxQuery(bucket_name=\"bucket-name\", start=S(\"-1d\"))\n\n# Create a filter that filters out all measurements that are not \"meas\" and all fields that are not \"field\"\nbuild_filter = FilterBuilder().measurement(\"meas\").field(\"field\").build()\n\nq = q | fn.Filter(fn=build_filter)\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```flux\nfrom(bucket:\"bucket-name\", start: \"-1d\")\n|> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == 'meas' and r._field == 'field')\n```\n",
