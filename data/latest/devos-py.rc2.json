Devos is built on top of [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax which is a Markdown-inspired tool that renders text in diagrams and it uses **[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) Query Language** over the ontology generating a visual summary. It's based on three approaches.\n\n1. OntMet. Uses Ontology Meta Data to find matching classes.\n2. ClaFreq. Relies on Class Frequency in the ontology as the importance signal.\n3. LabLen. Utilizes Label Length of the classes as the importance signal. The intuition is that importance classes have richer metadata than less important classes.\n\n\n## Main Features\n* Generate summary diagrams.\n  * Allows the user to use the summarisation technique (e.g., using meta data, class frequency, or label length)\n* Enrich ontologies with labels for the classes that are missing them.\n\n## Dependencies\n* [owl2diagram](https://github.com/jatoledo/owl2diagram)\n* [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt)\n\n## Install\n```pip install devos-py```\n\n# Usage\nThere are three main ways to use Devos. Web application, Python Library, and as a standalone application (CLI).\n\n## Web Application\nThe web application is built using Flask. To run it, you can use the following command: ```python -m web.app```. This will start the server on `127.0.0.1:5000`. You can also pass the port as a parameter.\n\n\n## As a library\n  You have three main functions: `meta_workflow`, `freq_workflow`, and `leng_workflow`. The all expects the path to the ontology, the output path to the summary diagram, and the maximum number of classes `topn` (referred to it in paper as `k`).\n\n\n\n## CLI Tutorial\n1. Use meta data as the signal for importance\n```\npython -m devos.gister -i data/ieswc/cocoon.ttl --freq\npython -m devos.gister -i data/ieswc_enriched/ck.ttl -t -d -a  \n\n\npython -m devos.gister -i data/ieswc_enriched/explanation-ontology.owl  -t -d -a --topn 7\n\n\npython -m devos.gister -i data/ieswc_enriched/devops/core.ttl   --freq --topn 7\n\npython -m devos.gister -i data/ieswc_enriched/devops/core.ttl   --freq --topn 7\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example**:\n\n\n```mermaid\n\tclassDiagram\n\nAgent  --> Document   :interest  \n\nPerson  --> Document   :publications  \n\nThing  --> Document   :page  \n\n\nAgent  --> Thing   :topic_interest  \n\nThing  --> Agent   :maker  \n\nGroup  --> Agent   :member  \n```\n\n## Experimentation\n\n[Experiments](experiments/README.md)\n\n\n\n## Tests\nTo run unit tests\n```\npython -m unittest discover tests \n```\n\n## Authors\n\n- [Ahmad Alobaid](https://github.com/ahmad88me) - (Ontology Engineering Group - UPM)\n- [Jhon Toledo](https://github.com/jatoledo) - (Ontology Engineering Group - UPM)\n- [María Poveda Villalón] - (Ontology Engineering Group - UPM)\n- [Oscar Corcho] - (Ontology Engineering Group - UPM)\n\n*[Ontology Engineering Group](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/)*, *[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/internacional)*.\n\n## License\n\nDeVoS is available under the permissive **[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Devos/blob/main/LICENSE)**.\n\n## PyPi\n```\npython -m build\ntwine check dist/*\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n\n",
