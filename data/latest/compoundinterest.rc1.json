    "description": "# **COMPOUND INTEREST FACTORS**\nThis is a module of compound interest factors which includes single payment, uniform payment series, and arithmetic gradient calculations\n### **By Zaafirrahman**\n\n## **Installation**\n\nThis library can be installed by the pip command, open your terminal and type in the following command...\n\n```python\npip install compoundinterest\n```\n\n## **Functions of this library**\n\nFirst import the library using this command \n```python\nimport compoundinterest as ci\n```\n and then proceed to call the functions\n\n## Single Payment\n\n## `ci.fp()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of future value based on present value\n\n## `ci.pf()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on future value\n\n\n## Uniform Payment Series\n\n## `ci.fa()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of future value based on annual value\n\n## `ci.af()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on future value\n\n## `ci.pa()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on annual value\n\n## `ci.ap()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on present value\n\n\n## Arithmetic Gradient\n\n## `ci.pg()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on gradient value\n\n## `ci.ag()`\n\nThis function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on gradient value\n\n\n## **The parameters**\n\n**i (interest rate)** - Interest rate (without percent) used in the calculation\n\n**n (time period)** - Investment time period (in year/s) used in the calculation\n\n### **Example :**\n\nYou are saving $ 30,000 USD in the bank at an interest rate of 10% annually. How much will it be worth when you take it in 5 years?\n\nIn this case, the variables that you already know are present value ($ 30,000 USD), interest rate (10%), and investment period (5 years). Whereas the variable that you are looking for is the future value. So you will need the `ci.fp()` function with the following calculations:\n\n```python\n>>> import compoundinterest as ci\n>>> ci.fp(10,5)*30000\n\n48315.30000000002\n```\n\nSo, your money in the next 5 years is $ 48,315.3 USD",
