    "description": "This plugin for `PieCrust`_ lets you import a `Wordpress`_ website directly\nfrom its SQL database, unlike the Wordpress importer that ships with PieCrust\nand can only import from an XML archive.\n\nMost of the time, your SQL database will only accept connections from\n``localhost``, in which case you'll have to make an SSH tunnel between your\nmachine and your server's machine::\n\n    ssh username@myserver.com -L 3307:localhost:3306 -N\n\nHere, ``username`` is a user that has SSH access to the machine running the SQL\nserver -- *not* the SQL user.\n\nThis command creates a \"tunnel\" between port 3307 on your local machine and\nport 3306 on your SQL server's machine.\n\nThen, you can run the importer by going through the tunnel::\n\n    chef import wordpress-sql mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost:3307/dbname\n\nHere, ``user`` and ``password`` *are* the credentials to the user with access\nto the SQL databse. ``dbname`` is the name of the SQL database. You may also\nwant to pass ``--prefix`` to specify what table name prefix your Wordpress\nwebsite is using.\n\n\n.. _piecrust: http://bolt80.com/piecrust/\n.. _wordpress: http://www.wordpress.org",
