The role of **SquAd** is to provide a simple and lightweight\nData Manager (and Account Server) *monitor*, with administrator-only\nfeatures not available in the UI.\n\n*Importantly* **SquAd** should be a \"rapid development\" platform where we\ncan add features quickly using a lightweight display framework.\n**SquAd** fails if we spend too much time battling with the UI.\n\nWe chose `Textual`_ because it...\n\n- has had some favorable reviews\n- works\n- is extremely lightweight\n- is under active development\n\n.. _data manager ui: https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/mini-apps-data-tier-ui\n.. _k9s: https://k9scli.io\n.. _squonk2-python-client: https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/squonk2-python-client\n.. _textual: https://github.com/Textualize/textual\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\n**SquAd** is a Python application, written with Python 3.10 and published\nto `PyPI`_ and is easily installed using ``pip``::\n\n    pip install im-squad\n\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.org/project/im-squad/\n\n*********\nExecution\n*********\n\nBefore running **SquAd** you must have access to a Squonk2 environment.\n**SquAd** obtains details of the environment through a YAML-based\n*environments* file. An example file, ``environments``, is located in the root\nof this project:\n\n..  code-block:: yaml\n\n    ---\n    # An example SquAd environments file.\n    #\n    # It provides all the connection details for one or more Squonk2 environments.\n    # It is expected to be found in the user's home directory\n    # as '~/.squad/environments' or the user can 'point' to it by setting\n    # 'SQUAD_ENVIRONMENT_FILE', e.g. 'export SQUAD_ENVIRONMENT_FILE=~/my-env'\n\n    # The 'environments' block defines one or more environments.\n    # Each has a name. Here we define an environment called 'site-a'\n    # but environments can be called anything YAML accepts as a key,\n    # although it would aid consistency if you restrict your names to letters\n    # and hyphens.\n    environments:\n      site-a:\n        # The hostname of the keycloak server, without a 'http' prefix\n        # and without a '/auth' suffix.\n        keycloak-hostname: example.com\n        # The realm name used for the Squonk2 environment.\n        keycloak-realm: squonk2\n        # The Keycloak client IDs of the Account Server and Data Manager.\n        # The Account Server client ID is optional.\n        keycloak-as-client-id: account-server-api\n        keycloak-dm-client-id: data-manager-api\n        # The hostnames of the Account Server and Data Manager APIs,\n        # without a 'http' prefix and without an 'api' suffix.\n        # If you have not provided an Account Server client ID its\n        # hostname value is not required.\n        as-hostname: as.example.com\n        dm-hostname: dm.example.com\n        # The username and password of an admin user that has access\n        # to the Account Server and Data Manager.\n        # The user *MUST* have admin rights.\n        admin-user: dlister\n        admin-password: blob1234\n\n    # The final part of the file is a 'default' property,\n    # which SquAd uses to select the an environment from the block above\n    # when all else fails. It's simply the name of one of the environment\n    # declarations above.\n    default: site-a\n\nWhen **SquAd** starts it will look for the environments file in your home\ndirectory, in the file ``~/.squonk2/environments``. If you place your populated\nenvironments file there you need do nothing else prior to running **SquAd**.\nIf you prefer to put your ``environments`` file elsewhere, or have multiple\nfiles, set the path to your file using the environment variable\n``SQUONK2_ENVIRONMENTS_FILE``::\n\n    export SQUONK2_ENVIRONMENTS_FILE=~/my-squonk2-environments\n\nWith an environments file in place you can run **SquAd**::\n\n    squad\n\nAs an alternative to having separate ``environments`` files for each Squonk2\nenvironment, you can populate the file with the details of more than one\nSquonk2 environment, giving each a unique name. If you do this\nyou can select them when you launch **SquAd** by providing the\nthe name of the environment on the command-line.\n\nFor example, if you have an ``environments`` file with details of two\nenvironments called ``site-a`` and ``site-b`` you can run **SquAd** with\nthe command::\n\n    squad site-a\n\nor::\n\n    squad site-b\n\nOne environment has be be named in the ``environments`` ``deafult`` property\n(maybe your *go to* environment) but using this technique you can quickly\nswitch between environments, or have multiple **SquAd** applications running,\nusing a single file.\n\nLogging\n-------\n\nYou can enable logging from **SquAd** and the underlying textual framework by\nsetting the environment variable ``SQUONK2_LOGFILE`` when running the\napplication::\n\n    SQUONK2_LOGFILE=./squad.log squad\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\n`Textual`_ doesn't like anything being written to the console so printing\n(even to ``stderr``) will topple the display. That's why ``stderr`` is\ndiverted when the application is running and nothing is printed.\nThere comes a time, though, when you need to see the error log.\nFor these times you can run **SquAd** without stderr diverted::\n\n    squad --enable-stderr\n",
