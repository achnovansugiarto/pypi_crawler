    "description": "# SimCem thermodynamic and process simulation package\n\nThis package uses the [stator Comptational Algebra System\n(CAS)](https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/stator) to treat\nthermodynamics in an equation-oriented way. This is important in\n**applied** thermodynamics as often additional constraints such as\nheat transfer, kinetics, or multi-stage processes need to be\nincluded.\n\nYou may be familiar with Gibb's free energy minimisation, but this on\nits own can only consider a single temperature and pressure. Other\nconstraints need the minimisation of other free energies, for example\nincluding heat loss/gain needs the maximisation of the system entropy.\n\nUsing an equation-oriented approach reduces the required iterations to\nsolve these problems and can lead to better optimisation as the whole\nproblem is exposed to the optimiser; however, it makes the setting up\nof such problems significantly more complex. The idea of SimCem is to\nhide as much of this complexity as possible.\n\nUltimately the thermodynamic problems are reduced to a constrained\nminimisation problem which is solved with the\n[IPOPT](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt) library. Using a CAS allows\nthese problems to be easily exported into other systems, such as\nMatlab/Mathematica, for verification.\n\n# Setup\n\nThis library is developed on Linux, but should compile on Windows\n(which is still being developed). You will need to install git, Python\n3, IPOPT, CMake, and sundials yourself. You can then clone the\nrepository and its other dependencies (Eigen, sundials, pybind11) like\nso:\n\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/toastedcrumpets/SimCem\n```\n\n## Current windows issues\n\nThe real challenge on windows is getting all the\ndependencies. Sundials and IPOPT are the two blockers preventing this\nat this time. Once the code is released, CI services such as\nTravis/Appveyor will be used to build packages for windows to save\neverybody this effort.\n\n# Building\n\nTo build the package, run\n\n```\n./setup.py build\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the package, run\n\n```\n./setup.py install\n```\n\n# Usage/Database\n\nYou will need a thermodynamic database to use SimCem. A free one\ncontaining data from NASA is available on request from\nm.campbellbannerman@abdn.ac.uk. This will be released for free in a\nseparate repository shortly.",
