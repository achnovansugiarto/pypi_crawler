    "description": "======================================================\nTippy : another Toolbox for Image Processing in PYthon\n======================================================\n\n\nTippy is a set of functions and methods designed to reduce as much as possible the code needed to deploy an <Image Processing> or <Computer Vision> algorithm. It is based on the famous <OpenCV> library and its Python bindings.\n\nOpenCV is one of the most famous Computer Vision library in the world, and surely the most famous one in the open-source one. It provides more than 500 functions, from basic one to complete and complex methods. \nIt is mainly implemented in C code, but now supports lots of languages and platforms (C++, java, iphone and android, ...). \n\nThis project aims at magnifying the power of OpenCV in using the power of Python. The idea is to get as much results as possible with as little code as possible. \nIn this way, this code will keep using well known OpenCV structures (such as cvMat or IplImage) while simplifying its use. \n\n\nLet's imagine we have an RGB image, and we want to display the histogram of its blue channel values.\nTypical usage often looks like this::\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n\timport cv\n\tfrom tippy import statistics as st\n\tfrom tippy import display_operations as do\n\t\n\t# test with 8 bits color image\n\timg_name = \"tippy/data/tippy.jpg\"\n\timg = cv.LoadImage(img_name, cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR)\n\thist = st.Histogram(img)\n\t    \n\timgs = hist.to_images() # list of Red, Green, Blue channels\n\tdo.display_single_image(imgs[2], \"Blue channel histogram of the tippy image\")\n\n\n**Please note that the library is in current development, and is only available as source code for now. This explains why the bin folder is still empty.**\n\n\nA Installation\n==============\n\nTo use Tippy, you will need the last OpenCV version with Python bindings. A descriptive tutorial for Linux systems can be found `here <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide%20%3A%20Debian>`_.\n\nTo be sure that you can use tippy, simply run python in command line and try to import OpenCV ::\n\n\tPython 2.7.2+ (default, Oct  4 2011, 20:03:08) \n\t[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2\n\tType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\t>>> import cv\n\nIf no error appears, Tippy shouold be installed without problems. \t\n\n\nBeing in the very beginning of its development, Tippy yet is not available in packaged version. To use it, you will need to download the source file and include them in your application. \n\nThe action is pretty straightforward though:\n* Download the tippy folder of the Tippy project\n* Place it in your working directory.\n* import parts of the library as you wish by using 'import file' in your Python code. \n\nB Hints and Usage\n=================\n\nImportant points of Tippy are documentation and examples. \nAn example will be create for every single function present in the Tippy package, so that it can easily be used by everyone. \nIn addition, tests should be carried out so that the code contain as few hidden bugs as possible.\n\nFinally, functions should be heavily documented to help users dig in without encounter language problems. \n\nI am currently thinking about generating a more complete and readable documentation, such as html output. It should come soon.\n\nC Copyright\n===========\n\nCopyright Â© 2011 Julien Lengrand-Lambert\n\nFiles are licensed under the under the BSD License.
