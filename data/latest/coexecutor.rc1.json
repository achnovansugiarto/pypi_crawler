    "description": "Though CoExecutor uses 1 CPU core at any time,\n\nlimitations such as 'max_workers' are needed for\nlimiting concurrent asyncio connections.\n\nThis is useful when you are building a asyncio-based web crawler.\n\nIt is designed to have exactly same result with respect to\npython's ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor.\n\nAlso, CoExecutor supports additional features like\n'limit' or 'out_of_order'.\n\ncoexecutor.map(..., limit=X) limits the number of pending futures\n(done, but not collected yet).\n\ncoexecutor.map(..., out_of_order=True) ignores the input iterator's ordering.\n\nThe results are collected by the termination order of the jobs.\n\nCoExecutor constructor requires a loop to rely on.\n\nWith debug=True, it will print the number of active coroutines per second.\n\nWorks with Python3.5+.",
