    "description": "# Neural-ILT\nNeural-ILT is an end-to-end learning-based mask optimization tool developed by the research team supervised by Prof. Evangeline F.Y. Young in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Neural-ILT attempts to replace the conventional end-to-end ILT (inverse lithography technology) correction process under a holistic learning-based framework. It conducts on-neural-network ILT correction for the given layout under the guidiance of a partial coherent imaging model and directly outputs the optimized mask at the convergence.\n\nCompared to the conventional academia ILT solutions, e.g., [MOSAIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6881379) (Gao *et al.*, DAC'14) and [GAN-OPC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8465816) (Yang *et al.*, TCAD'20), Neural-ILT enjoys:\n- much faster ILT correction process (20x ~ 70x runtime speedup)\n- better mask printability at convergence\n- modular design for easy customization and upgradation\n- ...\n\nMore details are in the following papers:\n* Jiang, Bentian, Lixin Liu, Yuzhe Ma, Hang Zhang, Bei Yu, and Evangeline FY Young. \"[Neural-ILT: migrating ILT to neural networks for mask printability and complexity co-optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9256592)\", in 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference On Computer Aided Design (ICCAD), pp. 1-9. IEEE, 2020.\n* Jiang, Bentian, Xiaopeng Zhang, Lixin Liu, and Evangeline FY Young. \"[Building up End-to-end Mask Optimization Framework with Self-training](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3439706.3447050)\", in Proceedings of the 2021 International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD), pp. 63-70. 2021.\n* Jiang, Bentian, Lixin Liu, Yuzhe Ma, Bei Yu, and Evangeline FY Young. \"[Neural-ILT 2.0: Migrating ILT to Domain-specific and Multi-task-enabled Neural Network.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9526856)\" IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (2021).\n\n## Requirements\n-   python: [3.7.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n-   pytorch: [1.8.0](https://pytorch.org/)\n-   torchvision: [0.2.2](https://pytorch.org/)\n-   cudatoolkit: [11.1.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)\n-   pillow: [6.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)\n-   GPU: >= 10GB GPU memory for pretrain, >= 7GB for Neural-ILT\n\n## Usage\n**Step 1:** Download the source codes. For example,\n~~~bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/cuhk-eda/neural-ilt.git\n~~~\n\n**Step 2:** Go to the project root and unzip the environment\n~~~bash\n$ cd Neural-ILT/\n$ unzip env.zip\n~~~\n(Optional) To replace the ICCAD'20 training dataset with the ISPD'21 training dataset (last batch)\n~~~bash\n$ cd Neural-ILT/dataset/\n$ unzip ispd21_train_dataset.zip\n~~~\n\n**Step 3:** Conduct Neural-ILT on [ICCAD 2013 mask optimization contest benchmarks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6691131)\n~~~bash\n$ cd Neural-ILT/\n$ python neural_ilt.py\n~~~\nNote that we observed minor variation (±0.5%) on mask printability score (L2+PVB, [statistics of 50 rounds](./stat/variation_test_neural_ilt.xlsx)). We haven't yet located the source of non-determinism. We would appreciate any insight from the community for resovling this non-determinism :sparkles:.\n\n**Step 4 (optional):** Backbone model pre-training\n~~~bash\n$ cd Neural-ILT/\n$ python pretrain_model.py\n~~~\n\n**Evaluation:** Evaluate the mask printability\n~~~bash\n$ cd Neural-ILT/\n$ python eval.py --layout_root [root_to_layout_file] --layout_file_name [your_layout_file_name] --mask_root [root_to_mask_file] --mask_file_name [your_mask_file_name]\n~~~\n\n### Parameters\n```angular2html\n |── neural_ilt.py\n |   ├── device/gpu_no: the device id\n |   ├── load_model_name/ilt_model_path: the pre-trained model of Neural-ILT\n |   ├── lr: initial learning rate\n |   ├── refine_iter_num: maximum on-neural-network ILT correction iterations\n |   ├── beta: hyper-parameter for cplx_loss in the Neural-ILT objective\n |   ├── gamma: lr decay rate\n |   ├── step_size: lr decay step size\n |   ├── bbox_margin: the margin of the crop bbox\n |\n |── pretrain_model.py\n |   ├── gpu_no: the device id\n |   ├── num_epoch: number of training epochs\n |   ├── alpha: cycle loss weight for l2\n |   ├── beta: cycle loss weight for cplx\n |   ├── lr: initial learning rate\n |   ├── gamma: lr decay rate\n |   ├── step_size: lr decay step size\n |   ├── margin: the margin of the crop bbox\n |   ├── read_ref: read the pre-computed crop bbox for each layout\n |\n |── End\n```\n\nExpolre your own recipe for model pretraining and Neural-ILT. Have fun! :smile:\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\nWe wolud like to thank the authors of [GAN-OPC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8465816) (Yang *et al.*, TCAD'20) for providing the [training layouts](https://github.com/phdyang007/GAN-OPC) used in our ICCAD'20 paper. Based on which, we further generated the ISPD'21 training layouts following the procedure described in [Jiang *et al.*, ISPD'21](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3439706.3447050).\n\n\n## Contact\n[Bentian Jiang](https://infamousmega.github.io/) (btjiang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk) and [Lixin Liu](https://liulixinkerry.github.io) (lxliu@cse.cuhk.edu.hk)\n\n\n\n## Citation\nIf Neural-ILT is useful for your research, please consider citing the following papers:\n```angular2html\n@inproceedings{jiang2020neural,\n  title={Neural-ILT: migrating ILT to neural networks for mask printability and complexity co-optimization},\n  author={Jiang, Bentian and Liu, Lixin and Ma, Yuzhe and Zhang, Hang and Yu, Bei and Young, Evangeline FY},\n  booktitle={2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference On Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)},\n  pages={1--9},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n@inproceedings{jiang2021building,\n  title={Building up End-to-end Mask Optimization Framework with Self-training},\n  author={Jiang, Bentian and Zhang, Xiaopeng and Liu, Lixin and Young, Evangeline FY},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2021 International Symposium on Physical Design},\n  pages={63--70},\n  year={2021}\n}\n@article{jiang2021neural,\n  title={Neural-ILT 2.0: Migrating ILT to Domain-specific and Multi-task-enabled Neural Network},\n  author={Jiang, Bentian and Liu, Lixin and Ma, Yuzhe and Yu, Bei and Young, Evangeline FY},\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## License\nREAD THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT.
