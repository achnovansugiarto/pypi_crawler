With this industry-focused SDK,\nyou can curate text datasets, and train and deploy\nlanguage models.\n\n.. inclusion-marker-1-ending-do-not-remove\n\n.. inclusion-marker-1-1-starting-do-not-remove\n\nIn particular, for the financial services industry, you can use a new set of\nmultimodal (long-form text, tabular) financial analysis tools within Amazon\nSageMaker JumpStart. With these new tools, you can enhance your tabular ML\nworkflows with new insights from financial text documents and help save weeks\nof development time. By using the SDK, you can directly retrieve financial documents\nsuch as SEC filings, and further process financial text documents with\nfeatures such as summarization and scoring for sentiment, litigiousness,\nrisk, and readability.\n\nIn addition, you can access language models pretrained\non financial texts for transfer learning, and use example notebooks for data\nretrieval, feature engineering of text data, enhancing the data into multimodal datasets,\nand improve model performance.\n\nSageMaker JumpStart Industry also provides prebuilt solutions for specific use cases\n(for example, credit scoring), which are fully customizable and showcase the use of\nAWS CloudFormation templates and reference architectures to accelerate your\nmachine learning journey.\n\n.. inclusion-marker-1-1-ending-do-not-remove\n\nFor detailed documentation, including the API reference,\nsee `ReadTheDocs <https://sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-pack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\n.. inclusion-marker-2-starting-do-not-remove\n\n\nInstalling the SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK is released to PyPI and\ncan be installed with pip as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install smjsindustry\n\n\nYou can also install from source by cloning this repository and running\na pip install command in the root directory of the repository:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-python-sdk.git\n    cd sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-python-sdk\n    pip install .\n\n\nSupported Operating Systems\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK supports Unix/Linux and Mac.\n\nSupported Python Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK is tested on:\n\n- Python 3.6\n- Python 3.7\n- Python 3.8\n\n\nAWS Permissions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK runs on Amazon SageMaker. As a managed service, Amazon SageMaker performs operations on your behalf\non the AWS hardware that is managed by Amazon SageMaker.\nAmazon SageMaker can perform only operations that the user permits.\nYou can read more about which permissions are necessary in the\n`Amazon SageMaker Documentation\n<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html>`__.\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK should not require any additional permissions aside from what is required for using SageMaker.\nHowever, if you are using an IAM role with a path in it, you should grant permission for ``iam:GetRole``.\n\n\nLicensing\n~~~~~~~~~\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK is licensed\nunder the Apache 2.0 License.\nIt is copyright Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.\nAll Rights Reserved. The license is available at\n`Apache License <http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/>`_.\n\n\nLegal Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. The SageMaker JumpStart Industry solutions, notebooks, demos, and examples are for demonstrative purposes only. It is not financial advice and should not be relied on as financial or investment advice.\n2. The SageMaker JumpStart Industry solutions, notebooks, demos, and examples\n   use data obtained from the SEC EDGAR database. You are responsible for complying\n   with EDGARâ€™s access terms and conditions located in the\n   `Accessing EDGAR Data <https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data>`_ page.\n\n\nRunning Tests\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe SageMaker JumpStart Industry SDK has unit tests and integration tests.\n\nYou can install the libraries needed to run the tests by running :code:`pip install --upgrade .[test]` or, for Zsh users: :code:`pip install --upgrade .\\[test\\]`\n\n**Unit tests**\n\nWe use tox to run Unit tests. Tox is an automated test tool that helps you run unit tests easily on multiple Python versions, and also checks the\ncode sytle meets our standards. We run tox with all of our supported Python versions(Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Python 3.8). In order to run unit tests\nwith the same configuration as we do, you need to have interpreters for those Python versions installed.\n\nTo run the unit tests with tox, run:\n\n::\n\n    tox tests/unit\n\n**Integrations tests**\n\nTo run the integration tests, you need to first prepare an AWS account with certain configurations:\n\n1. AWS account credentials are available in the environment for the boto3 client to use.\n2. The AWS account has an IAM role named :code:`SageMakerRole`.\n   It should have the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached as well as a policy with `the necessary permissions to use Elastic Inference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei-setup.html>`__.\n\nWe recommend selectively running just those integration tests you would like to run. You can filter by individual test function names with:\n\n::\n\n    tox -- -k 'test_function_i_care_about'\n\n\nYou can also run all of the integration tests by running the following command, which runs them in sequence, which may take a while:\n\n::\n\n    tox -- tests/integ\n\n\nBuilding Sphinx Docs Locally\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInstall the dev version of the library:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install -e .\\[all\\]\n\nInstall Sphinx and the dependencies listed in ``sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-python-sdk/docs/requirements.txt``:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install sphinx\n    pip install -r sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-python-sdk/docs/requirements.txt\n\nThen ``cd`` into the ``sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-python-sdk/docs`` directory and run:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    make html && open build/html/index.html\n\n\n.. inclusion-marker-2-ending-do-not-remove\n\n\n",
