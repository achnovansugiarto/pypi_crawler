Your file should include a few mandatory entries:\n```\nAPI_URL=http://my-api.myhost.com\nLAT=48.88\nLON=2.38\nCAM_USER=my_dummy_login\nCAM_PWD=my_dummy_pwd\n```\n\nAdditionally, you'll need a `./data` folder which contains:\n- `credentials.json`: a dictionary with the IP address of your cameras as key, and dictionary with entries `login` & `password` for their Alert API credentials\n- `model.onnx`: optional, will overrides the model weights download from HuggingFace Hub\n- `config.json`: optional, will overrides the model config download from HuggingFace Hub\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://pyronear.org/pyro-engine/) for detailed specifications.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease refer to [`CONTRIBUTING`](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you wish to contribute to this project.\n\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is developed and maintained by the repo owner and volunteers from [Data for Good](https://dataforgood.fr/).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the Apache 2 License.
