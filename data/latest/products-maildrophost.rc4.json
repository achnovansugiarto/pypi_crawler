    "description": "=======================\n Products.MaildropHost\n=======================\n\n.. contents::\n\nThe MaildropHost product provides support for sending email from\nwithin the Zope environment using MaildropHost objects. Unlike the \nbuilt-in MailHost object, the sending is done asynchronously from \na separate process. Furthermore, MaildropHost can optionally\nintegrate with the Zope transaction machinery to ensure that \nretried transactions do not lead to multiple emails being created.\n\nThe advantage is that sending mail from within web pages becomes \nmuch faster because invoking the mail machinery can be slow. With \nMaildropHost the web page will return immediately.\n\nMaildropHost uses a separate Python process to monitor the mail \nspool inside the product and handle mail in intervals that can be\nset by the administrator. There are separate start scripts included\nwith the product which can be used to start this monitor process. \n\nMails that cannot be sent successfully stay in the internal spool. \nEvery attempt to send email is logged to a log file kept by the \nmonitor process. This log file is closed after each maildrop run,\nso it is safe to rotate it without sending any special signals to\nthe maildrop daemon.\n\nThe maildrop daemon that delivers mail supports StartTLS and even\nauthenticated SMTP.\n\nStarting with Zope version 2.11.0-beta the standard MailHost \nimplementation does asynchronous mail handling as well. If you run \nZope 2.11 and up you should look at the standard MailHost product \nfirst and see if it fits your requirement before installing the \nMaildropHost product.\n\nBug tracker\n===========\n\nPlease post questions, bug reports or feature requests to the bug tracker\nat http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/\n\nSVN version\n===========\n\nYou can retrieve the latest code from Subversion using setuptools or\nzc.buildout via this URL:\n\nhttp://svn.dataflake.org/svn/Products.MaildropHost/trunk#egg=Products.MaildropHost\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nFollow these steps to use the product after installation:\n\n- edit the \"config\" configuration script in the toplevel\n  MaildropHost folder to reflect your particular needs, or\n  (optionally) add your own config file in a different location\n  on the filesystem. See below for how to use a configuration\n  file from a non-standard location.\n\n- start the mail spool checker by running the \"start_maildrop\"\n  script or with the other start scripts included in the package,\n  which can be found in maildrop/bin underneath the toplevel\n  MaildropHost folder. Edit the startup script to point to your\n  chosen configuration file.\n\n- instantiate a MaildropHost instance in your ZODB; if you\n  created a config file in a different location, specify the\n  filesystem path using the 'Configuration file path' setting\n  on the ZMI 'Edit' tab.\n\n- Now you can create emails using e.g. the dtml-sendmail tag and \n  point the sendmail tag to the MaildropHost instance using the \n  mailhost=\"XYZ\" argument inside the sendmail tag, or by using\n  the MailHost API (see the Zope Help System).\n\nInstead of using dtml-sendmail and a MaildropHost instance you can\ncreate email messages any way you like. As long as the formatting is\ncorrect (so that the mail spool checker can parse it, see the file\nSAMPLE_MAIL.txt for an example) and you write it to the spool\ndirectory which is at $MAILDROP_HOME/spool (or $MAILDROP_SPOOL if\ndefined) then the mail spool checker will pick it up and try to\ndeliver it.\n\nTo add more choices to the 'Configuration file path' option in \nthe ZMI, you need to add them to your Zope instance configuration\nfile, zope.conf. You need to create a section named 'product-config\nmaildrophost' and list paths as keys starting with 'config-path'::\n\n <product-config maildrophost>\n   config-path-1 /tmp/myconfig\n   config-path-2 /usr/local/mail/maildropconfig\n </product-config>\n\nThe keys must be unique since ZConfig does not allow duplicate keys in\na 'product-config' configuration section. You have to restart Zope\nfor those changes to be visible in the ZMI.\n\nIf you use different MaildropHost configurations you will need to \ncopy the start/stop scripts found in maildrop/bin and adjust the \nconfiguration file path accordingly.\n\n\nMail file format\n================\n\nThe format for a mail file (see SAMPLE_MAIL.txt) is very simple. The\nfirst line contains the recipient address, prefixed by \"##To:\". The\nsecond line is the sender address, prefixed by \"##From:\". These are\nequivalent to the \"envelope\" sender and receiver addresses.\n\nThe next few lines are headers that become part of the message body, \nthey are \"To: <recipient>\", \"From: <sender>\" and \"Subject: <subject>\".\n\nThe actual message is separated from the headers by a blank line.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation requirements\n=========================\n\n- a working SMTP server\n\n- Zope 2.8.0 or higher\n\n- A UNIX operating system to run the maildrop daemon. It does not work\n  on Windows.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIf you do not install MaildropHost as an egg, you can manually copy the \nMaildropHost folder from Products.MaildropHost/Products/MaildropHost\ninto a place where Zope can find it, like the \"Products\" directory:\n\n $ cp -r Products.MaildropHost/Products/MaildropHost <zope>/lib/python/Products/\n\nDo not forget to restart Zope afterwards.\n\nYou will find a file named \"config\" in the MaildropHost folder. \nThis file contains all site-specific settings and you must\nedit it to suit your needs. IMPORTANT: Since this file is also\nsourced by a few shell scripts you must not put any whitespace\naround equal (=) signs!\n\nStartup scripts for the standalone maildrop daemon, which processes\nmail items generated by the MaildropHost Zope product, can be found\ninside the <MaildropHost>/maildrop/bin-folder. What these scripts\ndo and how to use them is described in a separate README inside that\nfolder.\n\n\nUpgrade notes\n=============\n\n- 1.21 to 1.22: The configuration file parsing mechanism changed, it's no\n  longer a Python import. The code will now look for a file named `config`\n  instead of `config.py`. However, the file contents have not changed, your\n  existing MaildropHost configuration file contents remain valid.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaildropHost change log\n=======================\n\n2.3 (2009-10-09)\n----------------\n\n- Feature: Added a method for extending the list of configuration\n  file paths programatically.\n  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00649)\n\n\n2.2 (2009-05-29)\n----------------\n\n- Bug: If a configuration file path has been set, but the file is \n  removed later, Zope would no longer start up as the \n  MaildropHost code attempts to load the file but fails. Now it\n  will fall back to the default file path in this case.\n  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00642)\n\n- Bug: Replace file paths pointing to config.py as opposed to \n  the new config in stop_maildrop and testing/start_maildrop\n  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00641)\n\n- Remove a few extraneous log file close calls in maildrop.py\n  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00636)\n\n- fix testing to detect Zope trunk\n\n\n2.1 (2008-11-03)\n----------------\n\n- compatibility work for Zope 2.11\n\n\n2.0 (2008-11-01)\n----------------\n\n- Switch to releasing MaildropHost as egg\n\n- clean up Python module preambles based on the standard set by Zope\n  itself.\n\n- clean up Subversion keyword tagging to use the Id tag all over\n\n- major test refactoring and simplifications\n\n- The MaildropHost class is now marked to implement IMailHost, just\n  like the standard Zope 2 MailHost.\n\n- The configuration file for each MaildropHost instance can now be selected \n  in the ZMI on the 'Edit' tab. By default, the dropdown will show the file\n  'config' in the MaildropHost directory. The site administrator can add\n  more paths using the Zope instance configuration file zope.conf. Please \n  see README.txt to find out how.\n\n- cleaned up the help system content and use the name \"MaildropHost\" as \n  opposed to \"Maildrop Host\" wherever possible.\n\n\nPrevious releases\n-----------------\n\nSee HISTORY.txt\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownload\n========",
