    "description": "tiny_gnupg - A small-as-possible solution for handling GnuPG ed25519 ECC keys.\n==============================================================================\n\nA linux specific, small, simple & intuitive wrapper for creating, using\nand managing GnuPG's Ed25519 curve keys. In our design, we favor\nreducing code size & complexity with strong, bias defaults over\nflexibility in the api. Our goal is to turn the powerful, complex,\nlegacy gnupg system into a fun and safe tool to develop with.\n\nThis project is currently in unstable beta. It works like a charm, but\nthere's likely, and often bugs floating around, and the api is subject\nto change. Contributions are welcome.\n\n\n\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/tiny-gnupg.svg\n    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/tiny-gnupg\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/rmlibre/tiny_gnupg\n    :alt: GitHub\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n    :target: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/rmlibre/tiny_gnupg/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/rmlibre/tiny_gnupg/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg\n\n\n\n\nTable Of Contents \n----------------- \n\n#)  `Install`_ \n\n#)  `Basic Commands`_ \n\n#)  `Networking Examples`_ \n\n#)  `About Torification`_ \n\n#)  `More Commands`_ \n\n#)  `Retiring Keys`_ \n\n\n\n\n_`Install` \n---------- \n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    sudo apt-get install tor torsocks gnupg2 gpg-agent \n\n    pip install --user --upgrade tiny_gnupg \n\n\n\n\n_`Basic Commands` \n----------------- \n\nThe ``GnuPG`` class's instances are the primary interface for running commands & managing keys using the gpg2 executable. \n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG, run \n\n\n    PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY = \"/usr/bin/gpg2\" \n\n    gpg = GnuPG( \n\n        email_address=\"bob@user.net\", \n\n        passphrase=\"bobs's passphrase\", \n\n        executable=PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY, \n\n    ) \n\n\n    # This will generate a primary ed25519 ECC certifying key, and three \n\n    # subkeys, one each for the authentication, encryption, and signing \n\n    # functionalities. \n\n    gpg.generate_key() \n\n\n    # Now this fingerprint can be used with arbitrary gpg2 commands. \n\n    gpg.fingerprint \n\n\n    # But the key is stored in the package's local keyring. To \n\n    # talk to the package's gpg environment, an arbitrary command \n\n    # can be constructed like this -> \n\n    options = [\"--armor\", \"--encrypt\", \"-r\", gpg.fingerprint] \n\n    command = gpg.encode_command(*options) \n\n    inputs = gpg.encode_inputs(\"Message to myself\") \n\n    encrypted_message = gpg.read_output(command, inputs) \n\n\n    # If a command would invoke the need for a passphrase, the \n\n    # with_passphrase kwarg should be set to True -> \n\n    command = gpg.encode_command(*options, with_passphrase=True) \n\n\n    # The passphrase then needs to be the first arg passed to \n\n    # encode_inputs -> \n\n    inputs = gpg.encode_inputs(gpg.user.passphrase, *other_inputs) \n\n\n    # The list of keys in the package's environment can be accessed \n\n    # from the list_keys() method, which returns a dict -> \n\n    gpg.list_keys() \n    >>> {fingerprint: email_address, ...} \n\n\n    # Or retrieve a specific key where a searchable portion of its uid \n\n    # information is known, like an email address or fingerprint -> \n\n    gpg.list_keys(\"bob@user.net\") \n    >>> {\"EE36F0584971280730D76CEC94A470B77ABA6E81\": \"bob@user.net\"} \n\n\n    # Let's try encrypting a message to Alice, whose public key is \n\n    # stored on keys.openpgp.org/ \n\n\n    # First, we'll import Alice's key from the keyserver (This requires \n\n    # a Tor system installation. Or an open TorBrowser, and the tor_port \n\n    # attribute set to 9150) ->\n\n    # Optional: gpg.keyserver.network.tor_port = 9150\n\n    run(gpg.network_import(uid=\"alice@email.domain\")) \n\n\n    # Then encrypt a message with Alice's key and sign it -> \n\n    msg = \"So, what's the plan this Sunday, Alice?\" \n\n    encrypted_message = gpg.encrypt( \n\n        message=msg, uid=\"alice@email.domain\", sign=True \n\n    ) \n\n\n    # The process of encrypting a message to a peer whose public key \n\n    # might not be in the local package keyring is conveniently available \n\n    # in a single method. It automatically searches for the recipient's \n\n    # key on the keyserver so it can be used to encrypt the message -> \n\n    run(gpg.auto_encrypt(msg, \"alice@email.domain\"))  # Signing is automatic \n\n\n    # We could directly send a copy of our key to Alice, or upload it to \n\n    # the keyserver. Alice will need a copy so the signature on the \n\n    # message can be verified. So let's upload it to the keyserver -> \n\n    run(gpg.network_export(uid=\"bob@user.net\")) \n\n\n    # Alice could now import our key (after we do an email verification \n\n    # with the keyserver) -> \n\n    run(gpg.network_import(\"bob@user.net\")) \n\n\n    # Then Alice can simply receive the encrypted message and decrypt it -> \n\n    decrypted_msg = gpg.decrypt(encrypted_message) \n\n\n    # The process of decrypting a encrypted & signed message from a peer \n\n    # whose public key might not be in the local package keyring is \n\n    # conveniently available in a single method.

That's because GnuPG will throw an error immediately upon trying to import keys with their uid information stripped off.\n\nThe package no longer comes with its own gpg2 binary. Your system gpg2 executable is probably located at: /usr/bin/gpg2. You could also type: ``whereis gpg2`` to find it. If it's not installed, you'll have to install it with your system's equivalent of: ``sudo apt-get install gnupg2``\n\n.. _GnuPG: https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393\n\n\n\n\n_`Networking Examples` \n---------------------- \n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # Since we use SOCKSv5 over Tor for all of our networking, as well \n\n    # as the user-friendly aiohttp + aiohttp_socks libraries, the Tor \n\n    # networking interface is also available to users. These utilities \n\n    # allow arbitrary POST and GET requests to clearnet, or onionland, \n\n    # websites -> \n\n    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG, Network, run \n\n\n    client = Network(tor_port=9050)\n\n\n    async def read_url(client, url): \n        \"\"\" \n        Use the instance's interface to read the page located at the url \n        with a wrapper around an `aiohttp.ClientSession` context manager. \n        \"\"\" \n        async with client.context_get(url) as response: \n\n            return await response.text() \n\n\n    # Now we can read webpages with GET requests -> \n\n    page_html = run(read_url(client, \"https://keys.openpgp.org/\")) \n\n\n    # Let's try onionland -> \n\n    url = \"http://zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion/\" \n\n    onion_page_html = run(read_url(client, url)) \n\n\n    # Check your ip address for fun -> \n\n    ip_addr = run(read_url(client, \"https://icanhazip.com/\")) \n\n\n    # There's a convenience function built into the class that \n\n    # basically mimics read_url() -> \n\n    ip_addr = run(client.get(\"https://icanhazip.com/\")) \n\n\n    # POST requests can also be sent with the context_post() method. \n\n    # Let's use a POST request to send the keyserver a new key we \n\n    # create -> \n\n    async def post_data(client, url, payload=\"\"): \n        \"\"\" \n        Use the instance's interface to post the api payload to the \n        keyserver with a wrapper around an `aiohttp.ClientSession` \n        context manager. \n        \"\"\" \n        async with client.context_post(url, json=payload) as response: \n\n            return await response.text() \n\n\n    gpg = GnuPG(email_address=\"bob@user.net\", passphrase=\"bobs's passphrase\")\n\n    gpg.generate_key() \n\n    url = gpg.keyserver._key_export_api_url \n\n    payload = {\"keytext\": gpg.text_export(uid=gpg.fingerprint)} \n\n    api_token_json = run(post_data(client, url, payload)) \n\n\n    # There's also a convenience function built into the class that \n\n    # mimics post_data() -> \n\n    api_token_json = run(client.post(url, json=payload)) \n\n\n    # Of course, this is just for demonstration. The method that should \n\n    # be used for uploading a key to the keyserver is network_export ->\n\n    run(gpg.network_export(gpg.fingerprint))\n\n\n    # And there we have it, it's super simple. And these requests have \n\n    # the added benefit of being completely routed through Tor. The \n\n    # keyserver here also has a v3 onion address which we use to query, \n\n    # upload, and import keys. This provides a nice, default layer of \n\n    # privacy to our communication needs. \n\n\nThese networking tools work off instances of aiohttp.ClientSession. To learn more about how to use their POST and GET requests, you can read the docs here_.\n\n.. _here: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#client-session\n\n\n\n\n_`About Torification` \n--------------------- \n\nA user can make sure that any connections the gnupg binary makes with the network are always run through Tor by setting ``torify=True`` during initialization. \n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG\n\n\n    gpg = GnuPG(**user_details, torify=True) \n\n\nThis is helpful because there are gnupg settings which cause certain commands to do automatic connections to the web. For instance, when encrypting, gnupg may be set to automatically search for the recipient's key on a keyserver if it's not in the local keyring. This doesn't normally effect `tiny_gnupg` because it doesn't use gnupg's networking interface. It ensures Tor connections through the `aiohttp_socks` library. But, if gnupg does make these kinds of connections silently, using torify can prevent a user's IP address from being inadvertently revealed. \n\nUsing torify requires a Tor installation on the user system. If the user is running Debian / Ubuntu, then this guide_ could be helpful. \n\n.. _guide: https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en\n\n\n\n\n_`More Commands` \n---------------- \n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # An instance can also be constructed from lower-level objects -> \n\n    from tiny_gnupg import BaseGnuPG, User, GnuPGConfig, run \n\n\n    PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY = \"/usr/bin/gpg2\" \n\n\n    # Passphrases can contain any characters, even emojis -> \n\n    user = User(email_address=\"bob@user.net\", passphrase=\"✅🐎🔋📌\") \n\n    config = GnuPGConfig(executable=PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY, torify=True) \n\n    gpg = BaseGnuPG(user, config=config) \n\n\n    # It turns out that the encrypt() method automatically signs the \n\n    # message being encrypted. So, the `sign=False` flag only has to be \n\n    # passed when a user doesn't want to sign a message -> \n\n    encrypted_unsigned_message = gpg.encrypt( \n\n        message=\"sending message as an unidentified sender\", \n\n        uid=\"alice@email.domain\",  # sending to alice, \n\n        sign=False,  # no sender identification \n\n    ) \n\n\n    # It also turns out, a user can sign things independently from \n\n    # encrypting -> \n\n    message_to_verify = \"maybe a hash of a file?\"\n\n    signed_data = gpg.sign(target=message_to_verify) \n\n    assert message_to_verify == gpg.decrypt(signed_data)\n\n\n    # And verify a signature without checking the signed value -> \n\n    gpg.verify(message=signed_data)  # throws if invalid \n\n\n    # Or sign a key in the package's keyring -> \n\n    gpg.sign(\"alice@email.domain\", key=True) \n\n\n    # Importing key files is also a thing -> \n\n    path_to_file = \"/home/user/keyfiles/\" \n\n    gpg.file_import(path=path_to_file + \"alices_key.asc\") \n\n\n    # As well as exporting public keys -> \n\n    gpg.file_export(path=path_to_file, uid=gpg.user.email_address) \n\n\n    # And secret keys, but really, keep those safe! -> \n\n    gpg.file_export(\n\n        path=path_to_file, uid=gpg.user.email_address, secret=True\n\n    ) \n\n\n    # The keys don't have to be exported to a file. Instead they can \n\n    # be exported as strings -> \n\n    my_key = gpg.text_export(uid=gpg.fingerprint) \n\n\n    # So can secret keys (Be careful!) -> \n\n    my_secret_key = gpg.text_export(gpg.fingerprint, secret=True) \n\n\n    # And they can just as easily be imported from strings -> \n\n    gpg.text_import(key=my_key) \n\n\n\n\n_`Retiring Keys` \n---------------- \n\nAfter a user no longer considers a key useful, or wants to dissociate from the key, then they have some options:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG, run \n\n\n    PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY = \"/usr/bin/gpg2\" \n\n    gpg = GnuPG( \n\n        email_address=\"bob@user.net\", \n\n        passphrase=\"bobs's passphrase\", \n\n        executable=PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY, \n\n    ) \n\n\n    # They can revoke their key then distribute it publicly (somehow) \n\n    # (the keyserver can't currently handle key revocations) -> \n\n    revoked_key = gpg.revoke(gpg.fingerprint)  # <--  Distribute this! \n\n\n    # Uploading the revoked key will only strip the user ID information \n\n    # from the key on the keyserver. It won't explicitly let others know \n\n    # the key has been retired. However, this action cannot be undone -> \n\n    run(gpg.network_export(gpg.fingerprint)) \n\n\n    # The key can also be deleted from the package keyring like this -> \n\n    gpg.delete(uid=\"bob@user.net\") \n\n\n.. _key revocations: https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid/issues/137\n\n\n\n\n``Known Issues``\n=================\n\n-  Because of Debian `bug #930665`_, & related GnuPG `bug #T4393`_,\n   importing keys from the default keyserver `keys.openpgp.org`_ doesn’t\n   work automatically on all systems. Not without email confirmation, at\n   least. That’s because the keyserver will not publish uid information\n   attached to a key before a user confirms access to the email address\n   assigned to the uploaded key. And, because GnuPG folks are still\n   holding up the merging, & back-porting, of patches that would allow\n   GnuPG to automatically handle keys without uids gracefully. This\n   effects the ``network_import()`` method specifically, but also the\n   ``text_import()`` & ``file_import()`` methods, if they happen to be\n   passed a key or filename argument which refers to a key without uid\n   information. The gpg2 binary in this package can be replaced manually\n   if a user’s system has access to a patched version.\n-  Because of GnuPG `bug #T3065`_, & related `bug #1788190`_, the\n   ``--keyserver`` & ``--keyserver-options http-proxy`` options won’t\n   work with onion addresses, & they cause a crash if a keyserver\n   lookup is attempted. This is not entirely an issue for us since we\n   don’t use gnupg’s networking interface. In fact, we set these\n   environment variables anyway to crash on purpose if gnupg tries to\n   make a network connection. And in case the bug ever gets fixed (it\n   won’t), or by accident the options do work in the future, then a tor\n   SOCKSv5 connection will be used instead of a raw connection.\n-  This program may only be reliably compatible with keys that are also\n   created with this program. That’s because our terminal parsing is\n   reliant on specific metadata to be similar across all encountered\n   keys. It seems most keys have successfully been parsed with recent\n   updates, though more testing is needed.\n-  The tests don’t currently work when a tester’s system has a system\n   installation of tiny_gnupg, & the tests are being run from a local\n   git repo directory. That’s because the tests import tiny_gnupg, but\n   if the program is installed in the system, then python will get\n   confused about which keyring to use during the tests. This will lead\n   to crashes & failed tests. Git clone testers probably have to run\n   the test script closer to their system installation, one directory up\n   & into a tests folder. Or pip uninstall tiny_gnupg. OR, send a pull\n   request with an import fix.\n-  Currently, the package is part synchronous, & part asynchronous.\n   This is not ideal, so a decision has to be made: either to stay mixed\n   style, or choose one consistent style.\n-  We’re still in unstable beta & have to build out our test suite.\n   Contributions welcome.\n-  The tests seems to fail on some systems because of a torsocks \n   filter [1_][2_] which blocks some syscalls. This may be patched or not\n   applicable on non-linux operating systems.\n\n.. _bug #930665: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=930665\n.. _bug #T4393: https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393\n.. _keys.openpgp.org: https://keys.openpgp.org/\n.. _bug #T3065: https://dev.gnupg.org/T3065#111023\n.. _bug #1788190: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2/+bug/1788190\n.. _1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46634215/torsocks-and-unsupported-syscalls\n.. _2: https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/28861\n\n\n\n\n``Changelog`` \n============= \n\n\nChanges for version 0.9.0 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  The ``passphrase`` keyword argument is now processed through the \n   ``hashlib.scrypt`` function before being stored within a ``User`` instance \n   & used within the ``GnuPG`` & ``BaseGnuPG`` classes. The ``GnuPG`` & ``BaseGnuPG`` \n   classes also accept an optional ``salt`` keyword-only argument. These \n   changes secure user keys & passwords by default with a memory-hard \n   key derivation function & the uniqueness of the user-specified random \n   salt. These changes provide better security & aren't backwards \n   compatible. \n-  The ``email`` keyword argument to the ``User``, ``BaseGnuPG`` & ``GnuPG`` \n   classes was changed to ``email_address``. The attributes in the ``User`` \n   class have also mirrored this change. As well, the ``key_email`` method \n   on the ``GnuPG`` & ``BaseGnuPG`` classes is now ``key_email_address``. \n-  The ``User`` class now does type & value checking on the ``username``, \n   ``email_address`` & ``passphrase`` strings passed into the ``__init__``, \n   as well as whenever their associated property attributes are set. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Documentation improvements. \n-  Various refactorings & code cleanups. \n-  More type hinting was added & improved upon. \n-  Removed the improper usage of the ``NoneType`` for type hinting. \n-  New constants were added to the ``tiny_gnupg.py`` module to specify \n   problematic control & whitespace characters that shouldn't be used in \n   various user-defined inputs & credentials. \n-  The ``file_export`` methods of the ``GnuPG`` & ``BaseGnuPG`` classes now \n   saves key files with either ``\"public-key_\"`` or ``\"secret-key_\"`` strings \n   prepended to them to better specify for users the context of files \n   saved to their filesystems. \n-  Removed the svg image file which didn't accurately report the line \n   coverage with the new changes to the package. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.8.2 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Documentation improvements. \n-  The ``username`` keyword-only argument to the ``User`` & ``GnuPG`` classes \n   was given a default empty string. This change allows the ``username`` \n   to be optional & ignorable by the user. When generating a key with an \n   instance which doesn't have a ``username`` specified, then the associated \n   key will also not contain a username field. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.8.1 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Documentation improvements & typo fixes.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.8.0 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  The new ``GnuPGConfig`` & ``Keyserver`` classes were extracted from \n   the ``GnuPG`` class. ``GnuPGConfig`` holds onto each instance's path \n   strings to the system resources (like the gpg2 binary, the .conf \n   file, & the home directory), as well as other static constants &\n   instance specific settings (like the torify boolean flag). And, the \n   ``Keyserver`` class separates the Tor networking & key upload, \n   download, & searching logic. \n-  The ``GnuPG`` class was given a super class, ``BaseGnuPG``, which is \n   initialized using ``User`` & ``GnuPGConfig`` objects instead of the \n   strings & booleans which have until now been used to initialize a \n   ``GnuPG`` instance.  This allows users to choose between initializing \n   instances using the package's higher-level types or python built-in \n   types. \n-  The ``gen_key`` method of ``GnuPG`` & ``BaseGnuPG`` was changed to \n   ``generate_key``. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Docstring, documentation & type annotation fixes. \n-  Improved the clarity of error messages & the UX of error handling. \n-  Improved various GnuPG terminal output parsing logics. \n-  Heavy factorings to improve clarity & better organize the codebase. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.9 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Docstring & type annotation fixes. \n-  Small internal refactorings. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.8 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Security Alert: Users' separate ``GnuPG`` instance's with the same \n   home directory, which represent distinct & different secret keys, \n   can only be considered to represent separate identities during \n   runtime if the ``passphrase`` for each instance is distinct & \n   different. Past updates of the package have mentioned separate \n   identities as if one instance won't be able to access another's \n   secret keys, and this is **not** true unless their passphrases are \n   different. This is how GnuPG itself is designed, where all public & \n   secret keys are stored together in the home directory, & an identity \n   is more strongly considered to be the current operating system's user. \n   A more effective way a user can separate identities is by setting a \n   unique home directory for each identity. However, the GnuPG program \n   wasn't designed safely as it regards anonymity, so gaining confidence \n   in its ability to respect more nuanced identity boundaries is dubious \n   at best. \n-  The values that are inserted into raised exceptions were renamed to \n   be declarative of exactly what has been inserted. I.e., instead of \n   calling all the inserted exception object attributes something as \n   generic as ``value``, they are now ``inputs``, ``uid``, ``output``, \n   etc. This helps improve readability & clarity. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Various documentation improvements & fixes. \n-  Various code cleanups & refactorings. \n-  Added type hints to many of the codebase's parameters.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.7 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Some documentation improvements & refactorings. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.6 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Added the new ``Issue`` class. It takes care of raising exceptions \n   & giving error messages to the user for issues which aren't caused \n   by calling the gpg2 binary. This comes with some refactorings. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Various code cleanups & refactorings. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.5 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  New ``Terminal``, ``MessageBus`` & ``Error`` classes were created to \n   assist in some heavy refactorings of the codebase. Separating error \n   handling logic & sending commands to the terminal into their own \n   classes & methods. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Removed the ``import-drop-uids`` option from the package's import \n   commands for several reasons. First, this option doesn't work on most \n   systems. Second, if it did work, the result would be problematic, as \n   that would mean all uid information would always be dropped from \n   imported keys. This option was intended to keep GnuPG from crashing \n   when importing keys which don't have uid information, but it's an \n   unideal hack around the root problem. \n-  Some changes to function signatures for a better ux, & various code \n   cleanups. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.4 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  The ``homedir``, ``options``, ``executable``, ``_base_command``, \n   & ``_base_passphrase_command`` attributes are now all properties. This \n   keeps their values in-sync even after a user changes a ``GnuPG`` \n   instance's configurations. This also backtracks the last update's \n   solution of reseting static values after every mutation, to a \n   solution which reads attributes live as they're queried. The reduced\n   efficiency of not using cached values is not noticeable in comparison\n   to the many milliseconds it takes to run any gpg2 command.\n-  Reordering of the methods in the ``GnuPG`` class to better follow a \n   low-level to high-level overall semantic structure, with positional \n   groupings of methods which have related functionalities. \n-  Some other code refactorings, cleanups & docstring fixes. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.3 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Now, after either the paths for the executable, homedir or config \n   file are changed by the user, the ``_base_command`` & \n   ``_base_password_command`` string attributes are reset to mirror those \n   changes. This keeps the  instance's state coherent & updated \n   correctly. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.2 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Changed the default directory for the gpg executable to ``/usr/bin/gpg2``. \n   This isn't going to be appropriate for all users' systems. But, now \n   many users on linux installations won't need to pass in a path \n   manually to get the package to work. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.1 \n========================= \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Some interface refactorings for the ``Network`` class. \n-  Some docstring & readme fixes. \n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.7.0 \n========================= \n\n\nMajor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  The package no longer comes with its own gpg2 binary. The ``GnuPG`` class \n   was altered so that a user can set the path to the binary that exists \n   on their system manually. The path to the config file & to the home \n   directory can also be set independently now as well. Although, the \n   home directory & config file still default to the one's in the \n   package. These changes should allow users to more easily utilize the \n   package even if they aren't using Debian-like operating systems. \n-  The interface for the ``GnuPG`` class was also made a bit smaller by \n   making some methods private. \n-  The asynchronous file import & export functions were switched to \n   synchronous calls. This is a push towards a more sycnhronous focus, as \n   the gpg2 binary & gpg-agent processes don't play well with threaded \n   or truly asynchronous execution. The networking asynchrony will \n   remain. \n-  Heavy refactoring for method names to make the interface more unified \n   & conherent. \n-  The ``GnuPG`` class now only receives keyword-only arguments. The \n   ``username``, ``email`` & ``passphrase`` parameters no longer use \n   empty default string values. \n-  Removed the ``network_sks_import`` method which was no longer working. \n   The onion sks server seems to change its onion address to frequently \n   to maintain support within the package. \n-  Created ``Network`` & ``User`` classes to better separate concerns \n   to dedicated & expressive objects. \n\n\nMinor Changes \n------------- \n\n-  Various refactorings. \n-  Some bug fixes in the html parsing of the keyserver responses. \n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.6.1\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Edits to ``test_tiny_gnupg.py``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Cause of CI build failures found. The sks/pks keyserver's onion address\n   was not accessible anymore. They seemed to have switched to a new onion\n   address available here: http://pgpkeysximvxiazm.onion.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.6.0\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Changes to deduce bug causing CI failure.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Switch from ``aiohttp_socks``'s deprecated ``SocksProxy`` to the newer\n   and supported ``ProxyConnector``.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.9\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Add checks in ``network_sks_import()`` for html failute sentinels.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Spread out the amount of queries per key in ``test_tiny_gnupg.py`` so\n   the keyserver's rate limiting policies don't cause the CI build to\n   fail as often.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.8\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fix ``setup`` attribution kwargs in ``setup.py``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new ``network_sks_import()`` method which allows users to query the\n   sks infrastructure for public keys as well. We use an onion address mirror\n   of the sks/pks network available here: http://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion.\n-  Added new ``manual`` kwarg to ``command`` which simplifies the process\n   of using the ``GnuPG()`` class to manage gpg2 non-programmatically.\n   Passing ``manual=True`` will allow users to craft commands and interact\n   directly with the gpg2 interface.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.7\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Tests added to include checks for instance-isolated identities.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  ``reset_daemon()`` calls added to ``decrypt()``, ``verify()``, ``sign()``\n   & ``encrypt()``. This call kills the gpg-agent process & restarts it,\n   which in turn wipes the caching of secret keys available on the system\n   without a passphrase. This is crucial for users of applications with\n   multiple GnuPG objects that handle separate key identities. That's\n   because these methods will now throw ``PermissionError`` or ``LookupError``\n   if a private key operation is needed from an instance which is already\n   assigned to another private key in the keyring. This gives some important\n   anonymity protections to users.\n-  More improvements to error reporting.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.6\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added newly developed ``auto_decrypt()`` & ``auto_encrypt()`` methods\n   to the ``README.rst`` tutorial.\n-  Allow keyserver queries with spaces by replacing ``\" \"`` with url\n   encoding ``\"%20\"``.\n-  ``packet_fingerprint(target=\"\")`` & ``list_packets(target=\"\")`` methods\n   now raise ``TypeError`` when ``target`` is clearly not OpenPGP data.\n-  Tests added to account for new error handling in ``tiny_gnupg.py``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  ``--no-tty`` seems to keep most of the noise from terminal output while\n   also displaying important banner information. For instance, signature\n   verification still produces detailed signature information. Because it\n   automatically seems to behave as desired, it's here to stay.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.5\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added to Known Issues. Our package can't build on Github (Or most any\n   CI service) for many reasons related their build environments using\n   Docker & an issue in GnuPG itself.\n-  Removed Above known issue as a fix was found for using the Github CI\n   tool.\n-  Added ``_home``, ``_executable``, & ``_options`` attributes which\n   store the ``pathlib.Path.absolute()`` representation of the associated\n   files & directories.\n-  Added ``options`` attribute with is the str value of the ``_options``\n   ``pathlib`` path to the configuration file used by the package.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added ``\"--no-tty\"`` option to ``command()`` method which conveniently\n   tells gpg2 not to use the terminal to output messages. This has lead to\n   a substantial, possibly complete, reduction in the amount of noise gpg2\n   prints to the screen. Some of that printed information is helpful to\n   see, though. We would add it back in places where it could be informative,\n   but passing ``\"--no-tty\"`` has the added benefit of allowing Docker not\n   to break right out of the gate of a build test. More thought on this\n   is required.\n-  Removed ``pathlib`` from imports. That module has been in the standard\n   library since c-python3.4. This package isn't looking to be supported\n   for anything older than 3.6.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.4\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Style edits to ``PREADME.rst``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a major bug in ``decrypt()`` which miscategorized a fingerprint scraped\n   from a message as the sender's, when in fact it should be the recipient's.\n   Getting the sender's fingerprint requires successfully decrypting the\n   message & scraping the signature from inside if it exists. We do this\n   now, raising ``LookupError`` if the signature inside has no corresponding\n   public key in the package keyring.\n-  Added new ``auto_encrypt()`` method which follows after ``auto_decrypt()``\n   in allowing a user to attempt to encrypt a message to a recipient's\n   key using the value in the ``uid`` kwarg. If there's no matching key\n   in the package keyring, then the keyserver is queried for a key\n   that matches ``uid`` where then ``message`` is encrypted if found, or\n   ``FileNotFoundError`` is raised if not.\n-  Added better exception raising throughout the ``GnuPG`` class:\n\n   -  Now, instead of calling ``read_output()`` when the supplied ``uid``\n      has no key in the package keyring, a ``LookupError`` is raised.\n   -  The best attempt at deriving a 40-byte key fingerprint from ``uid`` is\n      returned back through the ``LookupError`` exception object's ``value``\n      attribute for downstream error handling.\n   -  ``verify()`` raises ``PermissionError`` if verification cannot be\n      done on the ``message`` kwarg. Raises ``LookupError`` instead if\n      a public key is needed in order to attempt verification. ``verify``\n      can't be used on an encrypted messages in general, unless ``message``\n      is specifcally a signature, not encrypted plaintext. This is just\n      not how verify works. Signatures are on the inside on encrypted\n      messages. So ``decrypt()`` should be used for those instead, it\n      throws if a signature is invalid on a message.\n   -  A rough guide now exists for what exceptions mean, since we've given\n      names & messages to the most likely errors, & helper functions\n      to resolve them. Users can now expect to run into more than just\n      the in decript ``CalledProcessError``. Exceptions currently being\n      used include: ``LookupError``, ``PermissionError``, ``TypeError``,\n      ``ValueError``, ``KeyError``, & ``FileNotFoundError``.\n\n-  ``ValueError`` raised in ``text_export()`` & ``sign()`` switched to\n   ``TypeError`` as it's only raised when their ``secret`` or ``key``\n   kwargs, respectively, are not of type ``bool``.\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.3\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixing PyPi ``README.rst`` rendering.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.2\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Futher test cleanups. We're now at 100% line coverage & 99% branch\n   coverage.\n-  Code cleanups. ``raw_packets()`` now passes the uid information it's\n   gathered through the ``KeyError`` exception, in the ``value`` attribute\n   instead of copying ``subprocess``'s ``output`` attribute naming convention.\n-  License, coverage, package version badges added to ``README.rst``.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.1\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed inaccuracies & mess-ups in the tests. Added tests for parsing\n   some legacy keys' packets with ``raw_packets()``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Bug in the packet parser has been patched which did not correctly\n   handle or recognize some legacy key packet types. This patch widens\n   the pool of compatible OpenPGP versions.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.5.0\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Removed coverage.py html results. They are too big, & reveal device\n   specific information.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.9\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Various code cleanups.\n-  Added to test cases for auto fetch methods & packet parsing.\n-  Documentation improvements: ``README.rst`` edits. ``CHANGES.rst``\n   Known Issues moved to its own section at the top. Docstrings now\n   indicate code args & kwargs in restructured text, double tick\n   format.\n-  Added ``use-agent`` back into the gpg2.conf file to help gnupg to not\n   open the system pinentry window. This may have implications for\n   anonymity since multiple instances runnning on a user machine will\n   be able to use the same agent to decrypt message's, even if the\n   decrypting instance wasn't the **intended** recipient. This may be\n   removed again. A factor in this decision is that, it's not clear\n   whether removing it or adding ``no-use-agent`` would even `have an impact`_\n   on the gpg-agent's decisions.\n-  ``_session``, ``_connector``, ``session`` & ``connector`` contructors\n   were renamed to title case, since they are class references or are\n   class factories. They are now named ``_Session``, ``_Connector``,\n   ``Session`` & ``Connector``.\n-  Added some functionality to ``setup.py`` so that the ``long_description``\n   on PyPI which displays both ``README.rst`` & ``CHANGES.rst``, will\n   also be displayed on github through a combined ``README.rst`` file.\n   The old ``README.rst`` is now renamed ``PREADME.rst``.\n\n.. _have an impact: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47273922/purpose-of-gpg-agent-in-gpg2\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  100% test coverage!\n-  Fixed bug in ``raw_packets()`` which did not return the packet\n   information when gnupg throws a \"no private key\" error. Now the\n   packet information is passed in the ``output`` attribute of the\n   ``KeyError`` exception up to ``packet_fingerprint()`` and\n   ``list_packets()``. If another cause is determined for the error, then\n   ``CalledProcessError`` is raised instead.\n-  ``packet_fingerprint()`` now returns a 16 byte key ID when parsing\n   packets of encrypted messages which would throw a gnupg \"no private\n   key\" error. The longer 40 byte fingerprint is not available in the\n   plaintext packets.\n-  New ``list_packets()`` method added to handle the error scraping of\n   ``raw_packets()`` & return the ``target``'s metadata information in\n   a more readable format.\n-  Fixed bug in ``format_list_keys()`` which did not properly parse\n   ``raw_list_keys(secret=False)`` when ``secret`` was toggled to ``True``\n   to display secret keys. The bug would cause the program to falsely\n   show that only one secret key exists in the package keyring,\n   irrespective of how many secret keys were actually there.\n-  Added a second round of fingerprint finding in ``decrypt()`` and\n   ``verify()`` to try at returning more accurate results to callers and\n   in the raised exception's ``value`` attribute used by ``auto_decrypt()``\n   & ``auto_verify()``.\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.8\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed typos across the code.\n-  Added to test cases.\n-  Documentation improvements. ``CHANGES.md`` has been converted to\n   ``CHANGES.rst`` for easy integration into ``README.rst`` and\n   ``long_description`` of ``setup.py``.\n-  ``README.rst`` tutorial expanded.\n-  Condensed command constructions in ``set_base_command()`` and\n   ``gen_key()`` by reducing redundancy.\n-  Fixed ``delete()`` method's print noisy output when called on a key\n   which doesn't have a secret key in the package's keyring.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added a ``secret`` kwarg to ``list_keys()`` method which is a boolean\n   toogle between viewing keys with public keys & viewing keys with\n   secret keys.\n-  Added a reference to the asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete\n   function in the package. It is now importable with\n   ``from tiny_gnupg import run`` or ``from tiny_gnupg import *``. It\n   was present in all of the tutorials, & since we haven’t decided to\n   go either all async or sync yet, it’s a nice helper.\n-  Added ``raw_packets(target=\"\")`` method which takes in OpenPGP data,\n   like a message or key, & outputs the raw terminal output of the\n   ``--list-packets`` option. Displays very detailed information of all\n   the OpenPGP metadata on ``target``.\n-  Added ``packet_fingerprint(target=\"\")`` method which returns the\n   issuer fingerprint scraped off of the metadata returned from\n   ``raw_packets(target)``. This is a very effective way to retrieve\n   uid information from OpenPGP signatures, messages & keys to\n   determine beforehand whether the associated sender's key is or isn't\n   already in the package's keyring.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.7\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed typos across the code.\n-  Added to test cases.\n-  Added tests explanation in ``test_tiny_gnupg.py``.\n-  Documentation improvements.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added exception hooks to ``decrypt()`` & ``verify()`` methods. They\n   now raise ``KeyError`` when the OpenPGP data they’re verifying\n   require a signing key that’s not in the package’s keyring. The\n   fingerprint of the required key is printed out & stored in the\n   ``value`` attribute of the raised exception.\n-  Added new ``auto_decrypt()`` & ``auto_verify()`` async methods\n   which catch the new exception hooks to automatically try a torified\n   keyserver lookup before raising a KeyError exception. If a key is\n   found, it’s downloaded & an attempt is made to verify the data.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.6\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added to test cases.\n-  Changed the project long description in the ``README.rst``.\n-  Added docstrings to all the methods in the ``GnuPG`` class, & the\n   class itself.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Turned off options in gpg2.conf ``require-cross-certification`` and\n   ``no-comment`` because one or both may be causing a bug where using\n   private keys raises an “unusable private key” error.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.5\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Updated package metadata files to be gpg2.conf aware.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added support for a default package-wide gpg2.conf file.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.4\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new tests. We’re at 95% code coverage.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Changed the default expiration date on generated keys from never to 3\n   years after created. This is both for the integrity of the keys, but\n   also as a courtesy to the key community by not recklessly creating\n   keys that never expire.\n\n-  Added ``revoke(uid)`` method, which revokes the key with matching\n   ``uid`` if the secret key is owned by the user & the key passphrase\n   is stored in the instance’s ``passphrase`` attribute.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.3\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Changed package description to name more specifically the kind of ECC\n   keys this package handles.\n-  Removed the trailing newline character that was inserted into the end\n   of every ``encrypt()`` & ``sign()`` message.\n-  Added new tests.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed bug in ``__init__()`` caused by the set_base_command() not\n   being called before the base commands are used. This leading to the\n   fingerprint for a persistent user not being set automatically.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.2\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added some keyword argument names to ``README.rst`` tutorials.\n-  Added section in ``README.rst`` about torification.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added a check in ``encrypt()`` for the recipient key in the local\n   keyring which throws if it doesn’t exist. This is to prevent gnupg\n   from using wkd to contact the network to find the key on a keyserver.\n-  Added a new ``torify=False`` kwarg to ``__init__()`` which prepends\n   ``\"torify\"`` to each gpg2 command if set to ``True``. This will make\n   sure that if gnupg makes any silent connections to keyservers or the\n   web, that they are run through tor & don’t expose a users ip\n   address inadvertently.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.1\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed typos in ``tiny_gnupg.py``.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.4.0\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added keywords to ``setup.py``\n-  Added copyright notice to LICENSE file.\n-  Code cleanups.\n-  Updated ``README.rst`` tutorials.\n-  Added new tests.\n-  Include .gitignore in MANIFEST.in for PyPI.\n-  Made all path manipulations more consistent by strictly using\n   pathlib.Path for directory specifications.\n-  Added strict truthiness avoidance to ``sign()`` for the ``key``\n   boolean kwarg.\n-  Added strict truthiness avoidance to ``text_export()`` for the\n   ``secret`` boolean kwarg.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added ``key`` kwarg to the ``sign(target=\"\", key=False)`` method to\n   allow users to toggle between signing arbitrary data & signing a\n   key in the package’s local keyring.\n-  Changed the ``message`` kwarg in ``sign(message=\"\")`` to ``target``\n   so it is also accurate when the method is used to sign keys instead\n   of arbitrary data.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.9\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new tests.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed new crash caused by ``--batch`` keyword in ``encrypt()``. When\n   a key being used to encrypt isn’t ultimately trusted, gnupg raises an\n   error, but this isn’t a desired behavior. So, ``--batch`` is removed\n   from the command sent from the method.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.8\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new tests.\n-  Removed ``base_command()`` method because it was only a layer of\n   indirection. It was merged into ``command()``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added the ``--batch``, ``--quiet`` & ``--yes`` arguments to the\n   default commands contructed by the ``command()`` method.\n-  Added the ``--quiet`` & ``--yes`` arguments to the command\n   constructed internally to the ``gen_key()`` method.\n-  Added a general uid —> fingerprint uid conversion in ``delete()`` to\n   comply with gnupg limitations on how to call functions that\n   automatically assume yes to questions. The Up-shot is that\n   ``delete()`` is now fully automatic, requiring no user interaction.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.7\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new tests.\n-  Typos & inaccuracies fixed around the code & documentation.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new ``secret`` kwargs to ``text_export(uid, secret=bool)`` and\n   ``file_export(path, uid, secret=bool)`` to allow secret keys to be\n   exported from the package’s environment.\n-  Added new ``post(url, **kw)`` & ``get(url, **kw)`` methods to allow\n   access to the networking tools without having to manually construct\n   the ``network_post()`` & ``network_get()`` context managers. This\n   turns network calls into one liners that can be more easily wrapped\n   with an asyncio ``run`` function.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.6\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added new tests for networking methods.\n-  Documentation updates & accuracy fixes.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Removed a check in ``network_import()`` which wasn’t useful and\n   should’ve been causing problems with imports, even though the tests\n   didn’t seem to notice.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.5\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Switched the aiocontext package license with the license for\n   asyncio-contextmanager.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  The packaging issues seem to be resolved. Packaging as v0.3.5-beta,\n   the first release that did not ship completely broken through pip\n   install –user tiny_gnupg.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.4\n=========================\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixing a major bug in the parameters passed to ``setup()`` which did\n   not correctly tell setuptools to package the gpghome folder & gpg2\n   binary. This may take a few releases to troubleshoot & bug fix\n   fully.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.3\n=========================\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a big bug where the wrong package was imported with the same\n   name as the intended module. AioContext was imported in setuptools,\n   but the package that is needed is asyncio-contextmanager for its\n   aiocontext module. This lead to the program being un-runable due to\n   an import error.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.2\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Rolled back the changes in ``trust()`` that checked for trust levels\n   on keys to avoid sending an unnecessary byte of data through the\n   terminal. Mostly because the attempted fix did not fix the issue. And\n   the correct fix involves a wide branching of state & argument\n   checking. That runs contrary to the goal of the package for\n   simplicity, so it isn’t going to be addressed for now.\n-  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fix bug in ``file_import()`` method where await wasn’t called on the\n   keyfile.read() object, leading to a crash.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.1\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a bug in ``trust()`` which caused an extra ``b“y\\n”``\n   to be sent to the interactive prompt when setting keys as anything\n   but ultimately trusted. This was because there’s an extra terminal\n   dialog asking for a “y” confirmation that is not there when a key is\n   being set as ultimately trusted. This didn’t have a serious effect\n   other than displaying a “Invalid command (try ‘help’)” dialog.\n-  Removed ``local_user`` kwarg from the ``raw_list_keys()`` and\n   ``trust()`` methods, as it doesn’t seem to matter which “user”\n   perspective views the list of keys or modifies trust. It is very\n   likely always displaying keys from the perspective of the global\n   agent.\n-  Typos, redundancies & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Tests updated & added to.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a bug in ``encrypt()`` which caused a ``“y\\n”`` to be\n   prepended to plaintext that was sent to ultimately trusted keys. This\n   was because there’s an extra terminal dialog asking for a “y”\n   confirmation that is not there when a key is ultimately trusted.\n-  Added a ``key_trust(uid)`` method to allow easy determination of\n   trust levels set on keys in the local keyring.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.3.0\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Changed MANIFEST.in to a more specific include structure, & a\n   redundant exclude structure, to more confidently keep development\n   environment key material from being uploaded during packaging.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Overhauled the ``gen_key()`` which now creates a different set of\n   default keys. We are no longer creating one primary key which does\n   certifying & signing, with one subkey which handles encryption.\n   Instead, we create one certifying primary key, with three subkeys,\n   one each for handling encryption, authentication, & signing. This\n   is a more theoretically secure default key setup, & represents a\n   common best-practice.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.9\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials\n-  Changed ``file_import()``\\ ’s ``filename`` kwarg to ``path`` for\n   clarity.\n-  Fixed bug in ``trust()`` which would allow a float to be passed to\n   the terminal when an integer was needed.\n-  Changed the way the email address in displayed in\n   ``network_export()``, removing the surrounding list brackets.\n-  Changed the FILE_PATH global to HOME_PATH for clarity.\n-  Changed the ``id_link`` variable in ``network_import()`` to\n   ``key_url`` for clarity.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a bug in ``format_list_keys()`` which would imporperly split\n   the output string when uid information contained the ``\"pub\"``\n   string.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.8\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed a bug in the ``trust()`` method which caused it to never\n   complete execution.\n-  Fixed a bug in the ``trust()`` method which falsely made 4 the\n   highest trust level, instead of 5.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.7\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Fixed statement in ``README.rst`` describing bug #T4393.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.6\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Typos, redundancies & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Added a new POST request tutorial to the ``README.rst``.\n-  Added ``\"local_user\"`` kwarg to some more methods where the output\n   could at least be partially determined by the point of view of the\n   key gnupg thinks is the user’s.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added a signing toggle to the ``encrypt(sign=True)`` method. Now, the\n   method still automatically signs encrypted messages, but users can\n   choose to turn off this behavior.\n-  Added a ``trust(uid=\"\", level=4)`` method, which will allow users to\n   sign keys in their keyring on a trust scale from 1 to 4.\n-  Fixed a bug in ``set_fingerprint(uid=\"\")`` which mistakenly used an\n   ``email`` parameter instead of the locally available ``uid`` kwarg.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.5\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Typos, redundancies & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Tests updated & added to.\n-  Changed ``raw_network_export()`` & ``raw_network_verify()`` methods\n   into ``raw_api_export()`` & ``raw_api_verify()``, respectively.\n   This was done for more clarity as to what those methods are doing.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Added ``sign(message)`` & ``verify(message)`` methods.\n-  Changed the ``keyserver`` & ``searchserver`` attributes into\n   properties so that custom ``port`` attribute changes are now\n   reflected in the constructed url, & the search string used by a\n   custom keyserver can also be reflected.\n-  Moved all command validation to the ``read_output()`` method which\n   simplifies the construction of ``command()`` & will automatically\n   ``shlex.quote()`` all commands, even those hard-coded into the\n   program.\n-  Fixed bug in ``set_homedir()`` which did not construct the default\n   gpghome directory string correctly depending on where the current\n   working directory of the calling script was.\n-  Added ``local_user`` kwarg to ``encrypt()`` & ``sign()`` so a user\n   can specify which key to use for signing messages, as gnupg\n   automatically signs with whatever key it views as the default user\n   key. Instead, we assume mesasges are to be signed with the key\n   associated with the email address of a GnuPG class instance, or the\n   key defined by the ``local_user`` uid if it is passed.\n-  Fixed –list-keys terminal output parsing. We now successfully parse\n   & parameterize the output into email addresses & fingerprints, of\n   a larger set of types of keys.\n-  Added ``delete()`` method for removing both public & private keys\n   from the local keyring. This method still requires some user\n   interaction because a system pinentry-type dialog box opens up to\n   confirm deletion. Finding a way to automate this to avoid user\n   interaction is in the work.\n-  Added automating behavior to the ``sign()`` & ``encrypt()`` methods\n   so that keys which haven’t been verified will still be used. This is\n   done by passing “y” (yes) to the terminal during the process of the\n   command.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.4\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Updated ``setup.py`` with more package information.\n-  Typos, redundancies & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Tests updated & added to.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.3\n=========================\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Typos & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Added package to `git repo`_\n-  Added git repo url to ``setup.py``.\n-  The ``port`` attribute is currently unused. It may be removed if it\n   remains purposeless.\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.2\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Typos & naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and\n   documentation.\n-  Switched the internal networking calls to use the higher level\n   ``network_get()`` & ``network_post()`` methods.\n-  Removed redundant ``shlex.quote()`` calls on args passed to the\n   ``command()`` method.\n-  Tests updated & added to.\n\n.. _git repo: https://github.com/rmlibre/tiny_gnupg.git\n\n\n\n\nChanges for version 0.2.1\n=========================\n\n\nMinor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  The names of some existing methods were changed. ``parse_output()``\n   is now ``read_output()``. ``gpg_directory()`` is now\n   ``format_homedir()``. The names of some existing attributes were\n   changed. ``gpg_path`` is now ``executable``, with its parent folder\n   uri now stored in ``home``. ``key_id`` is now ``fingerprint`` to\n   avoid similarities with the naming convention used for the methods\n   which query the package environment keys for uid information,\n   i.e. ``key_fingerprint()`` & ``key_email()``.\n\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n-  Good riddance to the pynput library hack! We figured out how to\n   gracefully send passphrases & other inputs into the gpg2\n   commandline interface. This has brought major changes to the package,\n   & lots of increased functionality.\n-  Many added utilities:\n\n   -  Keys generated with the ``gen_key()`` method now get stored in a\n      local keyring instead of the operating system keyring.\n   -  aiohttp, aiohttp_socks used to power the keyserver queries and\n      uploading features. All contact with the keyserver is done over\n      tor, with async/await syntax. ``search(uid)`` to query for a key\n      with matches to the supplied uid, which could be a fingerprint or\n      email address. ``network_import(uid)`` to import a key with\n      matches to the supplied uid. ``network_export(uid)`` to upload a\n      key in the package’s keyring with matches to the supplied uid to\n      the keyserver. Also, raw access to the aiohttp.ClientSession\n      networking interface is available by using\n      ``async with instance.session as session:``. More info is\n      available in the `aiohttp docs`_\n   -  New ``text_import(key)``, ``file_import(filename)``,\n      ``text_export(key)``, & ``file_export(path, uid)`` methods for\n      importing & exporting keys from key strings or files.\n   -  New ``reset_daemon()`` method for refreshing the system gpg-agent\n      daemon if errors begin to occur from manual deletion or\n      modification of files in the package/gpghome/ directory.\n   -  New ``encrypt(message, recipient_uid)`` & ``decrypt(message)``\n      methods. The ``encrypt()`` method automatically signs the message,\n      therefore needs the key passphrase to be stored in the\n      ``passphrase`` attribute. The same goes for the ``decrypt()``\n      method.\n   -  The ``command(*options)``, ``encode_inputs(*inputs)``, and\n      ``read_output(commands, inputs)`` methods can be used to create\n      custom commands to the package’s gpg2 environment. This allows for\n      flexibility without hardcoding flexibility into every method,\n      which would increase code size & complexity. The ``command()``\n      method takes a series of options that would normally be passed to\n      the terminal gpg2 program (such as –encrypt) & returns a list\n      with those options included, as well as, the other boiler-plate\n      options (like the correct path to the package executable, & the\n      package’s local gpg2 environment.). ``encode_inputs()`` takes a\n      series of inputs that will be needed by the program called with\n      the ``command()`` instructions, & ``bytes()`` encodes them with\n      the necessary linebreaks to signal separate inputs.\n      ``read_output()`` takes the instructions from ``command()`` and\n      inputs from ``encode_inputs()`` & calls\n      ``subprocess.check_output(commands, input=inputs).decode()`` on\n      them to retrieve the resulting terminal output.\n\n.. _aiohttp docs: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#client-session\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
