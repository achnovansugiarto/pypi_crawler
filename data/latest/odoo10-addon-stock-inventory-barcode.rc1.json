It is designed for the\nfollowing use case:\n\n* no tracking via Serial Numbers\n\n* the stock location of the inventory doesn't have children locations.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOn the form view of an inventory, once the inventory has been started\n(State = *In Progress*), you will see a button *Start Barcode\nInterface*. It will open a pop-up window that allows the user to easily\nenter the inventory quantity (or update the inventory quantity, in case\nthe product is found a second time at a different place during the\ninventory).\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/150/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* No tracking via Serial Number (I tried to implement it, but it makes\n  the interface more complex and/or slower to use: you can't get/create\n  the inventory line on the onchange of the Product field, you need to\n  the Serial Number to get/create the inventory line... but you also need\n  to handle the case of products that are not tracked by Serial Number,\n  etc...). I have tought in depth about it, and I think that it's better\n  to leave support for Serial Number outside of this module, to keep it\n  simple and easy-to-use for users that don't do any tracking via Serial\n  Numbers (which is the case of the point of sales).\n\n* Doesn't support inventory on locations that have children locations.\n  It is easy to add support for this, but it adds one field in the wizard,\n  thus make it slower to use for the user.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode/issues>`_.
