    "description": "# Flux: A State Machine\n\n[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/badges/dev/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/commits/dev) [![coverage report](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/badges/dev/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/commits/dev)\n\nFlux is a lightweight library that provides an API for implementing a state machine in \nPython. It is a work-in-progress, but has some really cool features (see below) and unit tested.\n\nState machines are a great way to manage complexity in your application and Flux provides \nyou with an elegant API for implementing state machines in your project.\n\n## Features\n- Supports an arbitrary number of States and Events.\n- States and Events support callbacks for responding to state transitions.\n- Transitions support the inclusion of arbitrary user data, making it easy to broadcast metadata across callbacks.\n- No dependencies for normal usage.\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the cheese shop:\n\n    pip install Flux\n\nFrom source:\n\n    pip install -e .\n\n## Usage\n\nA simple definition of a state machine is that any *machine* that has a set of *states* and *events* (also referred to as *transitions*) defined between them. The state machine pattern **enforces** only events that are allowed in the particular state can be triggered. However, this requires us to spend a bit of time upfront figuring out what are our states and which events can be triggered from these states.\n\nHere, we are going to create a simple water bottle filling machine. There are three states, Waiting, Filling, Done. There are three events that lets us transition from one state to the next. A diagram of this state machine looks like:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    Waiting --> Filling;\n    Filling --> Done;\n    Done --> Waiting;\n```\n\nWe start by importing in the main components of Flux:\n\n```python\nfrom flux.machine import StateMachine\nfrom flux.state import State, StateInfo\nfrom flux.event import Event, EventCallback\nfrom flux.errors import StateMachineError, StateMachineEventError, StateMachineStateError\n```\n\n```python\n# Callbacks for states\ndef did_enter_state(transition):\n    print(f'==> FSM::Did enter {transition.destination_state}')\n\ndef did_exit_state(transition):\n    print(f'<== FSM::Did exit {transition.source_state}')\n\ndef will_enter_state(transition):\n    print(f'--> FSM::Will enter {transition.destination_state} from {transition.source_state}')\n\ndef will_exit_state(transition):\n    print(f'<-- FSM::Will exit {transition.source_state}')\n\n# Callbacks for events\ndef did_fire_event(transition):\n    print(f'=> FSM::Did fire {transition.event} in state {transition.source_state}')\n\ndef will_fire_event(transition):\n    print(f'=> FSM::Will fire {transition.event} in state {transition.source_state}')\n\n# State configuration\nwaiting = State(name='waiting', info=StateInfo(did_enter_state=did_enter_state, \n                                               did_exit_state=did_exit_state,\n                                               will_enter_state=will_enter_state,\n                                               will_exit_state=will_exit_state))\n\nfilling = State(name='filling', info=StateInfo(did_enter_state=did_enter_state, \n                                               did_exit_state=did_exit_state,\n                                               will_enter_state=will_enter_state,\n                                               will_exit_state=will_exit_state))\n\ndone    = State(name='done', info=StateInfo(did_enter_state=did_enter_state, \n                                            did_exit_state=did_exit_state,\n                                            will_enter_state=will_enter_state,\n                                            will_exit_state=will_exit_state))\n\n# Event configuration\nstart_filling = Event(name='start_filling', info=EventInfo(source_states=[waiting], \n                                                           destination_state=filling,\n                                                           will_fire_event=will_fire_event,\n                                                           did_fire_event=did_fire_event))\n\nbottle_full   = Event(name='bottle_full', info=EventInfo(source_states=[filling], \n                                                         destination_state=done,\n                                                         will_fire_event=will_fire_event,\n                                                         did_fire_event=did_fire_event))\n\nremove_bottle = Event(name='remove_bottle', info=EventInfo(source_states=[done], \n                                                           destination_state=waiting,\n                                                           will_fire_event=will_fire_event,\n                                                           did_fire_event=did_fire_event))\n\n# Let build and use our water bottle filling state machine!\ntry:\n    fsm = StateMachine(states=[waiting, filling, done], \n                       events=[start_filling, bottle_full, remove_bottle], \n                       initial_state=waiting)\n\n    print('Adding a bottle to fill.')\n    fsm.activate()\n\n    time.sleep(1.0)\n    print('')\n    fsm.fire_event(start_filling)\n    time.sleep(1.0)\n    print('')\n    fsm.fire_event(bottle_full)\n    print('')\n    fsm.fire_event(remove_bottle)\n    print('✨ 🍰 ✨')\nexcept StateMachineEventError as e:\n    print(e.message)\nexcept StateMachineError as e:\n    print(e.message)\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nIn order to run all of unit tests, you will need `pytest` and `pytest-cov` installed. These can be\ninstalled using:\n\n    pip install -r flux/requirements.txt\n\nOnce installed you can run all unit tests using:\n\n    pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=flux tests/\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more information.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOur contributor code of conduct can be found in the `code-of-conduct.md` file.\n\n## License\n\nFlux is licensed under a three clause BSD License.
