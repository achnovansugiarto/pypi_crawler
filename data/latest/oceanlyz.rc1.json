    "description": ".. YA LATIF\n\nOCEANLYZ\n========\n\nOCEANLYZ, Ocean Wave Analyzing Toolbox, is a toolbox for analyzing the wave time series data collected by sensors in open body of water such as ocean, sea, and lake or in a laboratory.\n\nThis toolbox contains functions that each one is suitable for a particular purpose. Both spectral and zero-crossing methods are offered for wave analysis. This toolbox can calculate wave properties such as zero-moment wave height, significant wave height, mean wave height, peak wave period and mean period. This toolbox can correct and account for the pressure attention (pressure loss) in the water column for data collected by a pressure sensor. This toolbox can separate wind sea and swell energies and reports their properties.\n\n:Name: OCEANLYZ\n:Description: Ocean Wave Analyzing Toolbox\n:Version: 2.0\n:Requirements: MATLAB, or GNU Octave, or Python (3 or later)\n:Developer: Arash Karimpour (http://www.arashkarimpour.com)\n:Documentation: https://oceanlyz.readthedocs.io\n:Tutorial Video: `YouTube Playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcrFHi9M_GZRTCshcgujlK7y5ZPim6afM>`_\n:Source Code: https://github.com/akarimp/oceanlyz\n:Report Issues: https://github.com/akarimp/oceanlyz/issues\n\n\nInstallation (MATLAB Version)\n-----------------------------\n\nTo use MATLAB version of OCEANLYZ toolbox:\n\n* Install MATLAB or GNU Octave\n* Download OCEANLYZ:\n\n    * Version 2.0 (GitHub): https://github.com/akarimp/oceanlyz/releases/download/2.0/oceanlyz_2_0.zip\n    * Version 1.5 (CNET): https://download.cnet.com/Oceanlyz/3000-2054_4-75833686.html\n    * Version 1.5 (GitHub): https://github.com/akarimp/oceanlyz/releases/download/1.5/oceanlyz_1_5.zip\n    * Version 1.4 (GitHub): https://github.com/akarimp/oceanlyz/releases/download/1.5/oceanlyz_1_4.zip\n\n* Unzip OCEANLYZ in any location you choose such as “C:\\\\”\n\n\nInstallation (Python Version)\n-----------------------------\n\nTo use Python version of OCEANLYZ toolbox:\n\n* Install Python\n* Install OCEANLYZ\n\n**1) Install Python**\n\nFirst, we need to install Python programming language.\n\n* Method 1:\n    Install pure Python from https://www.python.org and then use the **pip** command to install required packages\n* Method 2 (Recommended):\n    Install Anaconda Python distribution from https://www.anaconda.com and then use the **conda** command to install required packages\n\n**2) Install OCEANLYZ**\n\nAfter Python is installed, we need to install OCEANLYZ package.\n\nTo install OCEANLYZ via pip (https://pypi.org/project/oceanlyz):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    pip install oceanlyz\n\nTo install OCEANLYZ via Anaconda cloud (https://anaconda.org/akarimp/oceanlyz):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n     conda install -c akarimp oceanlyz\n\n\nOperating System\n----------------\n\nThis code can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux. However, make sure any given path is compatible with a running operating system. In particular, “\\\\” is used in Windows path, while “/” is used in Mac or Linux path. For example, if a path is “C:\\\\” on Windows machine, it would be “C:/” on Mac or Linux.\n\n\nRequired Programing Language\n----------------------------\n\nThis toolbox can be run by using MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com), GNU Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave), or Python (https://www.python.org). \n\n\nRequired Package for MATLAB\n---------------------------\n\nMATLAB users need to install MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox for running the Oceanlyz spectral analysis. It gives Oceanlyz access to MATLAB Welch's power spectral density calculation. However, MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox it is not required for zero-crossing analysis. \n\n\nRequired Package for GNU Octave\n-------------------------------\n\nGNU Octave users need to install/load GNU Octave Signal Package for running the Oceanlyz spectral analysis. It gives Oceanlyz access to GNU Octave Welch's power spectral density calculation. However, GNU Octave Signal Package it is not required for zero-crossing analysis.\n\nGNU Octave Signal Package can be loaded inside GNU Octave by using a following command in a command window (This should be done every time GNU Octave is opened):\n\n\n.. code:: octave\n    \n    >> pkg load signal\n\n\nIf GNU Octave Signal Package is not already installed, it should be first installed from Octave Forge (octave.sourceforge.io), and then get loaded by using the following commands in a command window:\n\n.. code:: octave\n\n    >> pkg install -forge signal\n    >> pkg load signal\n\n\nRequired Package for Python\n---------------------------\n\nFollowing packages are required:\n\n* NumPy (https://numpy.org)\n* SciPy (https://www.scipy.org)\n* Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org)\n\n\nQuick Start (MATLAB Version)\n----------------------------\n\n* Open MATLAB or GNU Octave\n* Change a current folder (current directory) to a folder that contains OCEANLYZ toolbox, for example “C:\\\\oceanlyz”, in MATLAB or GNU Octave.\n* Open a file named “oceanlyzinput.m” in MATLAB or GNU Octave editor and modify it based on the properties of the collected dataset and required analysis.\n* Run a file named “RunOceanlyz.m” in MATLAB or GNU Octave to start calculations.\n\n\nQuick Start (Python Version)\n----------------------------\n\n* Open Python\n* Import OCEANLYZ package by using \"import oceanlyz\" \n* Create OCEANLYZ object such as “ocn=oceanlyz.oceanlyz()” in Python and set/modify its properties based on the dataset and required analysis.\n* Run a method as “ocn.runoceanlyz()” in Python to start calculations.\n\n\nRecommended Book\n----------------\n\n* | **Ocean Wave Data Analysis**\n  | Introduction to Time Series Analysis, Signal Processing, and Wave Prediction.\n  | Order at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692109978\n  |\n* | **Principles of Data Science with Python**\n  | Introduction to Scientific Computing, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.\n  | Order at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1735241008\n  |\n* | **Fundamentals of Data Science with MATLAB**\n  | Introduction to Scientific Computing, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.\n  | Order at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1735241016\n\nCitation\n--------\n\nCite this toolbox as:\n\nKarimpour, A., & Chen, Q.
