Account information to access\nthe Avatax dashboard can be obtained through the Avalara website here:\nhttps://www.avalara.com/products/avatax/\n\nOnce configured, the module operates in the background and performs\ncalculations and reporting seamlessly to the AvaTax server.\n\nThis guide includes instructions for the following elements:\n\n- Activating your organization's AvaTax account and downloading the product\n- Entering the AvaTax credentials into your Odoo database and configuring it\n  to use AvaTax services and features within Odoo\n\nNote: Test the module before deploying in live environment.\nAll changes to the AvaTax settings must be performed by a user with\nadministrative access rights.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT - resolving name conflict with Odoo EE**\n\nAvatax support was added to Odoo EE 14 and 15.\nUnfortunately the module names used are the same as the OCA ones,\nand because of this name collision the OCA modules were forced to change name.\n\nThe main module was renamed from ``account_avatax`` (now used by Odoo EE) to\n``account_avatax_oca``.\n\nTo apply this change in your odoo database and continue using the OCA Avalara certified\nconnector:\n\n  1. Ensure you have the latest version from the OCA, and you see ``account_avatax_oca``\n       in your Apps list.\n  2. Install the new ``account_avatax_oca`` module\n  3. Unistall the ``account_avatax`` module\n  4. Confirm that your configurations were kept safe, in particular:\n       Avatax API, \"Avatax\" default Fiscal Position, and \"Avatax\" default Tax record.\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install this app:\n\n- Download the AvaTax Module\n- Extract the downloaded file\n- Upload the extracted directory into your Odoo module/add-on directory\n- Restart your instance of Odoo\n- Log in as an Administrator\n- Navigate to 'Apps' and search 'AvaTax' in the search field\n- Click Install button\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo Configure AvaTax API:\n\n- Navigate to: Accounting or Invoicing App >> Configuration >> AvaTax >> AvaTax API\n- Click the Create button.\n- Uncheck the Disable AvaTax Calculation box\n- Fill out the form with your Company Code, Account Number, and License Key\n   as provided with your Avalara account\n- Select the proper service URL provided to you by Avalara: test or production.\n- Click the Test Connection button\n- Click the Save button\n\nOther Avatax API advanced configurations:\n\n- Adapter\n\n  - Request Timeout -- default is 300ms\n  - Enable Logging -- enables detailed AvaTax transaction logging within application\n\n- Address Validation\n\n  - Disable Address Validation\n  - Address Validation on save for customer profile -- automatically attempts\n    to validate on creation and update of customer profile,\n    last validation date will be visible and stored\n  - Force Address Validation -- if validation for customer is required but not valid,\n    the validation will be forced\n  - Return validation results in upper case -- validation results\n    will return in upper case form\n  - Automatically generate customer code -- generates a customer code\n    on creation and update of customer profile\n\n- Avalara Submissions/Transactions\n\n  - Disable Avalara Tax Commit -- validated invoices will not be sent to Avalara\n  - Enable UPC Taxability -- this will transmit Odoo's product ean13 number\n    instead of its Internal Reference.

If no address is assigned to the warehouse\n  the module will automatically use the address of the company as its origin.\n  Location code will automatically populate with the warehouse code\n  but can be modified if needed.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nThe development of this module was driven by US companies to compute Sales Tax.\n\nHowever the Avatax service supports more use cases, that could be added:\n\n- Add support to EU VAT\n- Add support to US Use Tax on Purchases / vendor Bills\n\nOther improvements that could be added:\n\n- Detect and warn if customers State is not a nexus available for the current account\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues/new?body=module:%20account_avatax_oca%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Open Source Integrators\n* Fabrice Henrion\n* Sodexis\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo SA\n\n  * Fabrice Henrion\n\n* Open Source Integrators (https://opensourceintegrators.com)\n\n  * Daniel Reis <dreis@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Bhavesh Odedra <bodedra@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Sandip Mangukiya <smangukiya@opensourceintegrators.com>\n\n* Serpent CS\n\n  * Murtuza Saleh\n\n* Sodexis\n\n  * Atchuthan Ubendran\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module was originally developed by Fabrice Henrion at Odoo SA,\nand maintained up to version 11.\n\nFor version 12, Fabrice invited partners to migrate this modules to\nlater version, and maintain it.\n\nOpen Source Integrators performed the migration to Odoo 12\n, and later added support for the more up to date REST API\n, alongside with the legacy SOAP API.\n\nWith the addition of the REST API, a deep refactor was introduced,\nchanging the tax calculation approach, from just setting the total\ntax amount, to instead adding the tax rates to each document line\nand then having Odoo do all the other computations.\n\nFor Odoo 13, the legacy SOAP support was supported, and\nadditional refactoring was done to contribute the module\nto the Odoo Community Association.\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-dreispt| image:: https://github.com/dreispt.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/dreispt\n    :alt: dreispt\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-dreispt| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-fiscal-rule <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/tree/14.0/account_avatax_oca>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
