    "description": "# IdleMypyExtension\nPython IDLE extension to preform mypy analysis on an open file\n\n## What does this extension do?\nThis IDLE extension hooks into the mypy daemon to type check the currently\nopen file or provide a function signature suggestion for the nearest function\nto the top from the current input cursor location. When type checking the\ncurrently open file with the \"Type Check File\" command, it will add comments\nto your code wherever mypy had something to say about about that line.\nYou can remove type comments from the currently selected text with the\n\"Remove Type Comments\" command.\nAdditionally, you can jump to the next comment this extension created in\nyour file with the \"Find Next Type Comment\" command. Finally, you can add\nan inferred function signature to your file with the \"Suggest Signature\"\ncommand when you are close by a function definition.\n\nNote: On use, creates folder `mypy` within the idle user directory.\nOn linux systems, this is usually `~/.idlerc/mypy`.\n\n## Installation\n1) Go to terminal and install with `pip install idlemypyextension`.\n2) Run command `idlemypyextension`. You will likely see a message saying\n`idlemypyextension not in system registered extensions!`. Run the command\ngiven to add idlemypyextension to your system's IDLE extension config file.\n3) Again run command `idlemypyextension`. This time, you should see the\nfollowing output: `Config should be good!`.\n4) Open IDLE, go to `Options` -> `Configure IDLE` -> `Extensions`.\nIf everything went well, alongside `ZzDummy` there should be and\noption called `idlemypyextension`. This is where you can configure how\nidlemypyextension works.\n\n\n## Information on options\n`action_max_sec` controls how long an action is allowed to take at most,\nin seconds.\nValues under 5 will make no effect\n\nFor `daemon_flags`, see `mypy --help` for a list of valid flags.\nThis extension sets the following flags to be able to work properly:\n```\n    --hide-error-context\n    --no-color-output\n    --show-absolute-path\n    --no-error-summary\n    --cache-dir=\"~/.idlerc/mypy\"\n```\n\nIf you add the `--show-column-numbers` flag to `daemon_flags`, when using the\n\"Type Check File\" command, it will add a helpful little `^` sign\nin a new line below the location of the mypy message that provided a column\nnumber, as long as that comment wouldn't break your file's indentation too much.\n\nIf you add the `--show-error-codes` flag to `daemon_flags`, when using the\n\"Type Check File\" command, when it puts mypy's comments in your code, it will\ntell you what type of error that comment is. For example, it would change the\nerror comment\n```python\n# types: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"int\")\n```\nto\n```python\n# types: assignment error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"int\")\n```\n\n`search_wrap` toggles weather searching for next type comment will wrap\naround or not.\n\n`suggest_replace` toggles weather Suggest Signature will replace the\nexisting function definition or just add a comment with the suggested\ndefinition\n\n`timeout_mins` controls how long the mypy daemon will time out after,\nin minutes.\n",
