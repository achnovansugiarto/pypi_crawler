    "description": "ocookie - a comprehensive cookie library for Python\n===================================================\n\nThe goal of ocookie is to provide a comprehensive API for working\nwith cookies.\n\ncookielib provides cookie management functionality, but the client and\nserver parts are separate and not easily convertible from one to the other.\nUsing cookielib is complicated because it expects httplib request and\nresponse objects in order to parse cookies. Lastly, cookielib's API\nitself can be improved.\n\nocookie should satisfy the needs of any application dealing with cookies.\nSpecifically it aims to address the following use cases:\n\n- HTTP clients/crawlers/scrapers dealing with cookies\n- HTTP servers dealing with cookies\n- HTTP proxies forwarding cookies\n- Test frameworks keeping track of cookies and asserting over cookies\n- Examining cookies returned from a single request\n- Keeping track of session cookies via a cookie jar\n- Maintaining pristine lists of cookie headers\n- Accessing cookies as dictionaries\n\nAt the same time ocookie is intended to be easy to use:\n\n- Client and server interfaces are similar where it makes sense\n- Straightforward conversions from client to server objects and vice versa\n- Clear and intuitive naming conventions\n- Complete documentation\n\nocookie is not intended to provide a full cookie parser, as this turns out\nto be a rather complex undertaking. ocookie has a minimal parser that\nwill work for most web sites and applications, and for the remaining cases\nocookie will fall back on cookielib for cookie parsing.\n\nNote: API is not yet stable.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nExecute the test suite by running ``nosetests``.\n\nThe test suite uses some nose features and will not work with unittest alone.\n\n.. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/p/ocookie.png\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/p/ocookie\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nReleased under the 2 clause BSD license.\n",
