    "description": "# implicitdict\n\nThis library primarily provides the `ImplicitDict` base class which enables the inheriting class to implicitly be treated like a `dict` with entries corresponding to the fields of the inheriting class.  Simple example:\n\n```python\nclass MyData(ImplicitDict):\n    foo: str\n    bar: int = 0\n    baz: Optional[float]\n\ndata: MyData = ImplicitDict.parse({'foo': 'asdf', 'bar': 1}, MyData)\nassert json.dumps(data) == '{\"foo\": \"asdf\", \"bar\": 1}'\n```\n\nSee [class documentation for `ImplicitDict`](https://github.com/interuss/implicitdict/blob/main/src/implicitdict/__init__.py) and [test_normal_usage.py](https://github.com/interuss/implicitdict/blob/main/tests/test_normal_usage.py) for more information.\n",
