    "description": "# Imraylib\n\nIntegrates Imgui with Raylib.\n\nThe integration does not directly connect Imgui with Raylib.\nThis permits you to selectively filter events to prevent them being sent to Imgui.\n\nFor example: if you had a number of different Imgui interfaces or possibly even\none rendered inside a first-person game. You don't want them receiving events\nuntil the player begins interacting with the specific Imgui interface.\n\nIf you don't care about this, there is a convenience function `send_all_events`\nwhich will send all Raylib data to Imgui and \"just work\".\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install imraylib`\n\nUntil [raylibpy](https://github.com/overdev/raylib-py) merges the `raylibpy-3.7` branch to master,\nyou must manually install it from Git.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [raylibpy](https://github.com/overdev/raylib-py) - Specifically the `raylibpy-3.7` branch.\n* [raylib-py-flat](https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/raylib-py-flat) - Simplifies `raylibpy` imports\n* [pyimgui](https://github.com/swistakm/pyimgui)\n\n\n## Example\n\nSee [example/demo.py](example/demo.py) for an example\n\nBSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021, Adam Griffiths\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
