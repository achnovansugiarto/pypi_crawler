    "description": "python-anthemav\n===============\n\n|Build Status| |GitHub release| |PyPI|\n\nThis is a Python package to interface with\n`Anthem <http://www.anthemav.com>`__ AVM and MRX receivers and\nprocessors. It uses the asyncio library to maintain an object-based\nconnection to the network port of the receiver with supporting methods\nand properties to poll and adjust the receiver settings.\n\nThis package was created primarily to support an anthemav media_player\nplatform for the `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__\nautomation platform but it is structured to be general-purpose and\nshould be usable for other applications as well.\n\nImportant\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will maintain a persistant connection to the network\ncontrol port which will prevent any other application from communicating\nwith the receiver. This includes the Anthem iOS and Android remote\ncontrol app as well as the ARC-2 room calibration software. You will\nneed to disable any application that is using the library in order to\nrun those other applications.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-  Python 3.6 or newer with asyncio\n-  An Anthem MRX or AVM receiver or processor\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\n-  This has only been tested with an MRXx20 series receiver, although\n   the Anthem protocol was largely unchanged from the MRXx10 series. It\n   should work with the older units, but Iâ€™d appreciate feedback or pull\n   requests if you encounter problems. It will definitely not work with\n   the original MRXx00 units or the D2v models.\n\n-  Only Zone 1 is currently supported. If you have other zones\n   configured, this library will not allow you to inspect or control\n   them. This is not an intractable problem, I just chose not to address\n   that nuance in this initial release. Itâ€™s certainly feasible to add\n   support but I am not settled on how that should be exposed in the\n   internal API of the package.\n\n-  I skipped over a lot of the more esoteric settings that are available\n   (like toggling Dolby Volume on each input). If I passed over a\n   setting thatâ€™s really important to you, please let me know and Iâ€™ll\n   be happy to add support for it. Eventually I intend to cover the full\n   scope of the Anthem API, but you know how it goes.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can, of course, just install the most recent release of this package\nusing ``pip``. This will download the more rececnt version from\n`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav>`__ and install it to your\nhost.\n\n::\n\n   pip install anthemav\n\nIf you want to grab the the development code, you can also clone this\ngit repository and install from local sources:\n\n::\n\n   cd python-anthemav\n   pip install .\n\nAnd, as you probably expect, you can live the developerâ€™s life by\nworking with the live repo and edit to your heartâ€™s content:\n\n::\n\n   cd python-anthemav\n   pip install . -e\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe package installs a command-line tool which will connect to your\nreceiver, power it up, and then monitor all activity and changes that\ntake place. The code for this console monitor is in\n``anthemav/tools.py`` and you can invoke it by simply running this at\nthe command line with the appropriate IP and port number that matches\nyour receiver and its configured port:\n\n::\n\n   anthemav_monitor --host 10.0.0.100 --port 14999\n\nHelpful Commands\n----------------\n\n::\n\n   sudo tcpflow -c port 14999\n\nInteresting Links\n-----------------\n\n-  `Project Home <https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav>`__\n-  `API Documentation for Anthem Network\n   Protocol <http://www.anthemav.com/downloads/MRX-x20-AVM-60-IP-RS-232.xls>`__\n   (Excel Spreadsheet)\n-  `Pictures of cats <http://imgur.com/r/cats>`__\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n-  This package was written by David McNett.\n\n   -  https://github.com/nugget\n   -  https://keybase.io/nugget\n\nHow can you help?\n-----------------\n\n-  First and foremost, you can help by forking this project and coding.\n   Features, bug fixes, documentation, and sample code will all add\n   tremendously to the quality of this project.\n\n-  If you have a feature youâ€™d love to see added to the project but you\n   donâ€™t think that youâ€™re able to do the work, Iâ€™m someone is probably\n   happy to perform the directed development in the form of a bug or\n   feature bounty.\n\n-  If youâ€™re anxious for a feature but itâ€™s not actually worth money to\n   you, please open an issue here on Github describing the problem or\n   limitation. If you never ask, itâ€™ll never happen\n\n-  If you just want to thank me for the work Iâ€™ve already done, Iâ€™m\n   happy to accept your thanks, gratitude, pizza, or bitcoin. My bitcoin\n   wallet address can be on `Keybase <https://keybase.io/nugget>`__ or\n   you can send me a donation via\n   `PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/macnugget>`__.\n\n-  Or, if youâ€™re not comfortable sending me money directly, Iâ€™ll be\n   nearly as thrilled (really) if you donate to `the\n   ACLU <https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu>`__,\n   `EFF <https://supporters.eff.org/donate/>`__, or\n   `EPIC <https://epic.org>`__ and let me know that you did.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/actions/workflows/build.yml\n.. |GitHub release| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/release/nugget/python-anthemav.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/releases\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/anthemav.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav",
