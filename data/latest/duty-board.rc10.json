Examples would be:\n    1. Different color schemes.\n    2. Your own company logo.\n    3. Icons for extra user information.\n    4. And much much more.\n- ðŸ’ª React front-end is pre-compiled and served through FastAPI.\n- ðŸ†Ž Fully typed code base.\n\n## Requirements\nPython 3.8+\n\nDutyBoard runs using:\n- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web service.\n- [iCal-library](https://jorricks.github.io/iCal-library/) for it's integration with iCalendars.\n\n## Plugin structure\nMore on this later once it's fully deployed.\n\n## Why this project?\nLarger corporations often have many Duty schedules. This is often to shield team members from ad-hoc work during their work-week or to ensure the platform runs smoothly 24/7. However, exposing Duty schedules is easy at the start, but once you have three schedules, it becomes unclear who is on duty. Hence, a small front-end usually solves this, but that require manual intervention when the schedule changes. This projects aims to solve that by automatically fetching who is on duty from iCalendars\n\n## Ideas for additional features\n- Implement announcement calendar.\n- Implement extra plugin sync functionality, e.g. Workday integration.\n",
