This means that I have made a conscious tradeoff where clarity of the\ncode outweighs subtle and exotic implementation constructs.\n\nThe library has mostly been implemented as a recreational project and should\nas such not be used in production code, since most of the data structures and\nalgorithms are already available in the standard Python library. However,\nwriting software that is robust, performs well, and is easy to maintain requires\nknowledge of data structures and algorithms. Therefore, implementing and\nexperimenting with these provides valuable knowledge about the inner workings\nand implementation details found in such standard libraries.\n\nFEATURES\n========\nData structures included in the library\n\n+ Dynamic array\n+ Stack\n+ Queue\n+ BinaryHeap\n\n   - MinHeap\n   - MaxHeap\n\n+ LinkedList\n\n   - Singly linked list\n   - Doubly linked list\n\n+ Partition/Union-Find\n+ Graph\n   - Directed\n   - Undirected \n   - Directed weighted\n   - Undirected weighted\n\nAdditionally, the library contains the most common algorithms and operations\nneeded when working with these data structures.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\nThe library is selfcontained and does not have any external dependencies.\nPyAlgDat should run on any platform with Python 2.7 or above.\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\nThe package can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   $ pip install PyAlgDat\n\nEXAMPLES\n========\nPyAlgDat has a collection of functional test examples which shows how the\nlibrary can be used from a client's perspective. \n\nShortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm\n----------------------------------------\nBelow is a simple example showing howto create a directed weighted graph\nusing PyAlgDat and how the shortest path in this graph can be found using\nDijkstra's algorithm.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n   \"\"\"\n   Test of Dijkstra's algorithm for a Directed Weighted Graph.\n   \"\"\"\n\n   def create_graph():\n        \"\"\"\n   \tCreates a Directed Weighted Graph\n\t\"\"\"\n    \t# Create an empty directed weighted graph\n    \tgraph = DirectedWeightedGraph(7)\n\n    \t# Create vertices\n    \tvertex0 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"A\")\n    \tvertex1 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"B\")\n    \tvertex2 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"C\")\n    \tvertex3 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"D\")\n    \tvertex4 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"E\")\n    \tvertex5 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"F\")\n    \tvertex6 = UnWeightedGraphVertex(graph, \"G\")\n\n    \t# Add vertices\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex0)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex1)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex2)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex3)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex4)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex5)\n    \tgraph.add_vertex(vertex6)\n\n    \t# Add edges\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex0, vertex1, 7)   # ( A <- B, 7 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex1, vertex2, 2)   # ( B <- C, 2 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex1, vertex6, 3)   # ( B -> G, 3 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex2, vertex3, 2)   # ( C -> D, 2 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex2, vertex6, 4)   # ( C -> G, 4 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex3, vertex4, 5)   # ( D -> E, 5 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex3, vertex6, 1)   # ( D -> G, 1 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex4, vertex5, 6)   # ( E -> F, 6 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex5, vertex0, 1)   # ( F <- A, 1 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex5, vertex6, 4)   # ( F <- G, 4 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex6, vertex0, 7)   # ( G -> A, 7 )\n    \tgraph.add_edge(vertex6, vertex4, 1)   # ( G -> E, 1 )\n\n    \t#       B--<--7--<--A\n    \t#      / \\         / \\\n    \t#     /   \\       /   \\\n    \t#    2     3     7     1\n    \t#   /       \\   /       \\\n    \t#  /         \\ /         \\\n    \t# C-->--4-->--G--<--4--<--F\n    \t#  \\         / \\         /\n    \t#   \\       /   \\       /\n    \t#    2     1     1     6\n    \t#     \\   /       \\   /\n    \t#      \\ /         \\ /\n    \t#       D-->--5-->--E\n\n    \treturn graph\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n      # Make it possible to use py_alg_dat without performing\n      # an installation.
