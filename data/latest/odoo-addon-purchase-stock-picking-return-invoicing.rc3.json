In the bill or refund\nthe correct quantity will be proposed, based on those fields.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCase 1: When you return to a supplier some products, and you have not yet\nreceived the bill from the supplier\n\n#. Go to *Purchases > Purchase > Purchase Orders > Create*.\n#. Choose a supplier and add a product whose *Control Purchase Bills* is\n   *On received quantities*, and input some quantity to purchase.\n#. Confirm the purchase order.\n#. Go to *Shipment > Validate > Apply* so as to receive the quantities ordered.\n#. Press the button *Return*.\n#. In the wizard *Reverse Transfer* set *Quantity* to the quantity to be\n   returned. Press *Return* to complete the wizard. **IMPORTANT**: You have to\n   mark \"To refund (Update SO/PO)\" check before pressing the button.\n#. On the return picking press *Validate > Apply*.\n#. Go back to the purchase order. You will notice that the field *Returned\n   Qty* is now the quantity that was returned.\n#. Press the button *Create Bill* to create the vendor bill.\n#. The proposed vendor bill will be proposed for the difference between the\n   received and the returned quantity.\n\nCase 2: When you return to a supplier some products, and you have already\nreceived a bill from the supplier.\n\n#. Go to *Purchases > Purchase > Purchase Orders > Create*.\n#. Choose a supplier and add a product whose *Control Purchase Bills* is\n   *On received quantities*, and input some quantity to purchase.\n#. Confirm the purchase order.\n#. Go to *Shipment > Validate > Apply* so as to receive the quantities ordered.\n#. Go back to the purchase order. Press the button *Create Bill* to create\n   the vendor bill.\n#. The proposed vendor bill will be proposed for the quantity received. The\n   *Billing Status* is now 'Fully Billed'\n#. Go to the original incoming shipment\n#. Press the button *Return*.\n#. In the wizard *Reverse Transfer* set *Quantity* to the quantity to be\n   returned. Press *Return* to complete the wizard. **IMPORTANT**: You have to\n   mark \"To refund (Update SO/PO)\" check before pressing the button.\n#. On the return picking press *Validate > Apply*.\n#. Go back to the purchase order. It will have  *Billing Status* as 'Waiting\n   Bills'. You will notice that the field *Returned Qty* is now the quantity\n   that was returned.\n#. Press the button *Refunds* to create the vendor refund bill.\n#. The proposed vendor refund bill will be proposed for the quantity that is\n   to be refunded.\n#. If you back to the purchase order, you will notice that *Billing Status*\n   is now 'Fully Billed', even when the quantity ordered does not match\n   with the quantity invoiced, because you did return some products.\n\nRemark: If you accept that you will not claim for a refund for the quantity\nreturned to the supplier, just leave without checking the mark\n\"To refund (Update SO/PO)\" on the return dialog.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-invoicing/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-invoicing/issues/new?body=module:%20purchase_stock_picking_return_invoicing%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* ForgeFlow\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Forgeflow <https://www.forgeflow.com>:\n\n  * Jordi Ballester Alomar <jordi.ballester@forgeflow.com>\n  * Juany Davila <juany.davila@forgeflow.com>\n\n* Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>\n\n  * Pedro M.
