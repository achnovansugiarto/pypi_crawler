This code is an extension of the\nstandard reduced-base framework and provides an efficient and accurate solution for model building.\nIt implements the hp-greedy refinement strategy, an enhancement approach for reduced-base model\nbuilding. The approach uses a parameter space partitioning, a local reduced basis and a binary tree\nas the resulting structure, all obtained automatically.\nThe usability of this package is similar to that of the scikit-learn modules. For usage examples, see the documentation. \n\n# Motivation\n\nGravitational waves are generated by extremely complex physical systems where a large number of variables are involved in their modeling, which makes their study and analysis difficult. Reduced models allow simplifying the real physical system through approximations and simplifications, making it easier to analyze and study these systems. In addition, these reduced models also allow for faster and more accurate simulations and analysis of the gravitational waves generated by these systems. This is highly necessary to compare the gravitational wave signals obtained experimentally.\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the latest stable version of ScikitReducedModel from PyPI:\n\n```bash\npip install skreducedmodel\n```\n\nTo install the developer version (may be unstable):\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/francocerino/scikit-reducedmodel\ncd scikit-reducedmodel\npip install .\n```\n\n# Quick Usage\n\nIn order to construct a reduced model, we require knowledge of a training set (training_set). \nThat is, we need to be familiar with a set of functions parameterized \nby a real number λ, denoted as :math:`f_λ(x)`.\n\nWe need also a distretization of the :math:`x` (x_set) and of the :math:`λ` space (param).\n\nThen, we can first built the reduced basis, in this case, we use the default parameters. \n```python\n\nfrom skreducedmodel.reducedbasis import ReducedBasis\n\nrb = ReducedBasis()\nrb.fit(training_set = training_set,\n       parameters = param\n       physical_points = x_set)\n```\nThe second step is built the empirical interpolator with the reduced basis generated\n```python \n\nfrom skreducedmodel.empiricalinterpolation import EmpiricalInterpolation\n\neim = EmpiricalInterpolation(rb)\neim.fit()\n```\nFinally, we construct the reduced model from our eim object\n```python \n   \nfrom skreducedmodel.surrogate import Surrogate\n\nmodel = Surrogate(eim)\nmodel.fit()\n```\n\nIn case we are interested in studying the ReducedBasis and EmpiricalInterpolation objects, the package has a function that automates the whole process.\n```python\n\nfrom skreducedmodel.mksurrogate import mksurrogate\n\nsurrogate = mksurrogate(parameters = param,\n                        training_set = training_set,\n                        physical_points = x_set,\n                        )\n\n```\n## Contributions\n\nWe encourage users to contribute with ideas, code, or by reporting bugs. To report bugs or issues, users should create an issue in the project repository. To contribute with code, please submit a pull request. We suggest that you contact us at francocerino@gmail.com prior to undertaking any significant improvement that requires substantial effort to address technical and design aspects before beginning development.\n\n\n## Authors\n\n- Franco Cerino <[francocerino@gmail.com](francocerino@gmail.com)> ([FaMAF-UNC][]).\n\n- Agustín Rodríguez-Medrano  ([IATE-OAC-CONICET][], [FaMAF-UNC][]).\n\n[FaMAF-UNC]: https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/\n[IATE-OAC-CONICET]: http://iate.oac.uncor.edu/\n",
