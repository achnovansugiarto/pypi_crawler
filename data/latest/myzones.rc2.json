    "description": "Show the timezones you're interested in in a dialog.\n\nIf you live in the southern hemisphere like I do, you probably constantly struggle to figure out\nwhat time it is in the northern hemisphere.  This is because, when daylight savings time comes\naround the north jumps forward and we jump back (or vice-versa).  To make things even more\ncomplicated, the date and hour that the time changes is usually different.  There will be one or\nmore weeks where time difference is X hours.  Add the classic \"off by one\" error or a little\ndyslexia and your bound to get the time wrong and wake somebody up at 8:00 in the morning.\n\nWith MyZones you configure the timezones you are most interested in and then run it.  You can go\nforward or backwards in time if you are trying to schedule a date in the future, say.\n\nA screenshot can be found here : http://myzones.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/screen-shot.png\n\nYou can configure to show the timezones you are interested in.  As long as the timezone on your machine is correct and your computer's clock is on time, then it should show the right time for that timezone.  The pytz ({{{apt-get install python-tz}}} for debian users) module is very complete (and correct) even has historical timezones that don't exist anymore.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n   * pytz\n   * wxPython\n   * Python\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nUnder Linux create a file called ~/.myzones.ini or ~/myzones.ini and it'll use that file for configuration.  Under Windows you would put the file it under something like 'c:\\Documents and Settings\\scott\\My Documents'.\n\nThe configuration file looks something like this::\n\n  [config]\n  show_seconds:True\n  [timezones]\n  MTV: 1|US/Pacific\n  Mom: 2|US/Eastern\n  *Home*: 3|Brazil/East\n\nIn the config section, you can put in some configuration information, of which there is currently only one thing to configure.\n\nFor the timezones section you can give any names on the left hand side and the time zone (one of\nthe [http://myzones.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/common_zone_names.txt Common Zone Names] ) If you\nwant the timezones to appear in a certain order you need to prepend the name with 1|, 2|, etc., and\nis thus recommended.",
