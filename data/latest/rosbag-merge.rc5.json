    "description": "\n\n### Getting Started\n\n\n```\npip3 install rosbag-merge\n```\n\n OR\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install .\n```\n\nThis package currently uses icecream as the logger in order to better identify the locations of bugs. Eventually the logging will happen through print.\n\n\n\n# Usage\n\nBasic elements for usage are an in path and out path for data being processed and created, respectively.\n\n```--outbag_name```\n* Define an outbag name using the flag.\n\n```--input_paths``` \n* Define input paths for the data of interest. (csv or bags)\n\n```--output_path```\n* Define where to save newly created data (csv or bags)\n\n```--topics```\n* Topics which should be filtered. Use this to speed up all of the processing. To use all topics then simply omit the flag.\n\n```--topic-file```\n* Topics which should be filtered. Use this to speed up all of the processing. To use all topics then simply omit the flag. A file representing a list of topics. One topic per line.\n\n```--write_bag```\n* Including the flag tells ```rosbag-tools``` to write a new bag. Be sure to include an ```--outbag-name```.\n\n```--write_csvs```\n* Including the flag tells ```rosbag-tools``` to write a csv's with the topic data of interest.\n\n```--merge_csvs```\n* Takes the csvs in the input path and makes a single csv. The csv will fill topic data such that the new csv fills in data to share the same time and is easier to vizualize on plotjuggler or through matplotlib.\n\n> NOTE : More arguments are available if you want to use specific CSV's or Bag files. Run `rosbag-merge -h` for more information.\n\n### Some environment variables\n\n```\nexport IN_PATH=/path/to/data\nexport OUT_PATH=/path/to/data\nexport OUTBAG_NAME=new-bag-name\nexport INPUT_TOPICS='/topic/namespace_1 /topic/namespace_2 /topic/namespace_3'\n```\n\n### Merge Bag Files\n\nMerge all the bag files from the current directory.\n```\nrosbag-merge --write_bag --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME\n```\n\nMake a merged bage with all topics.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_bag\n```\n\nTo merge bag files with select topics, and make single topics csvs.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --topics $INPUT_TOPICS --write_bag \n```\n\nTo merge bag files with select topics, and make single topics csvs.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_bag --write_csvs \n```\n\nLoop through the bag msgs and make single topics csvs.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_csvs \n```\n\nLoop through the bag msgs and make single topics csvs.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_csvs \n```\n\n\n### Merge CSVs\n\nFor now, merging csvs must be done **after** making the CSVs on a previous command.\n```\nrosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --output_path $OUT_PATH  --merge_csvs\n```\n\n",
