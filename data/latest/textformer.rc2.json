Are you tired of re-implementing and defining state-of-the-art architectures? If yes, Textformer is the way-to-go! This package provides a straightforward implementation of sequence-to-sequence and transformer-based architectures, fostering all research related to text generation and translation.\n\nUse Textformer if you need a library or wish to:\n\n* Create your network;\n* Design or use pre-loaded state-of-the-art architectures;\n* Mix-and-match encoder and decoders to solve your problem;\n* Because it is fun to transform text.\n\nRead the docs at [textformer.readthedocs.io](https://textformer.readthedocs.io).\n\nTextformer is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.\n\n---\n\n## Package guidelines\n\n1. The very first information you need is in the very **next** section.\n2. **Installing** is also easy if you wish to read the code and bump yourself into, follow along.\n3. Note that there might be some **additional** steps in order to use our solutions.\n4. If there is a problem, please do not **hesitate**, call us.\n\n---\n\n## Getting started: 60 seconds with Textformer\n\nFirst of all. We have examples. Yes, they are commented. Just browse to `examples/`, chose your subpackage, and follow the example. We have high-level examples for most tasks we could think of.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to learn even more, please take a minute:\n\nTextformer is based on the following structure, and you should pay attention to its tree:\n\n```yaml\n- textformer\n    - core\n        - model\n    - datasets\n        - generative\n        - translation\n    - models\n        - decoders\n            - bi_gru\n            - conv\n            - gru\n            - lstm\n            - self_attention\n        - encoders\n            - bi_gru\n            - conv\n            - gru\n            - lstm\n            - self_attention\n        - layers\n            - attention\n            - multi_head_attention\n            - position_wide_forward\n            - residual_attention\n        - att_seq2seq\n        - conv_seq2seq\n        - joint_seq2seq\n        - seq2seq\n        - transformer\n    - utils\n        - constants\n        - exception\n        - logging\n        - visualization\n```\n\n### Core\n\nThe core is the core. Essentially, it is the parent of everything. You should find parent classes defining the basis of our structure. They should provide variables and methods that will help to construct other modules.\n\n### Datasets\n\nBecause we need data, right? Datasets are composed of classes and methods that allow preparing data for further transformers.\n\n### Models\n\nEach neural network architecture is defined in this package. From Seq2Seq to Transformers, you can use whatever suits your needs.\n\n### Utils\n\nThis is a utility package. Common things shared across the application should be implemented here. It is better to implement once and use it as you wish than re-implementing the same thing over and over again.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nWe believe that everything has to be easy. Not tricky or daunting, Textformer will be the one-to-go package that you will need, from the very first installation to the daily-tasks implementing needs. If you may just run the following under your most preferred Python environment (raw, conda, virtualenv, whatever)!:\n\n```bash\npip install textformer\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to install the bleeding-edge version, please clone this repository and use:\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n---\n\n## Environment configuration\n\nNote that sometimes, there is a need for additional implementation. If needed, from here, you will be the one to know all of its details.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n### Windows\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n### MacOS\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n---\n\n## Support\n\nWe know that we do our best, but it is inevitable to acknowledge that we make mistakes. If you ever need to report a bug, report a problem, talk to us, please do so! We will be available at our bests at this repository or gustavo.rosa@unesp.br.\n\n---\n\n\n",
