The module highly prioritizes developer experience for researchers and engineers, by allowing them to work with a few high level objects (e.g. polynomials, polynomial vectors) that contain built-in methods to abstractly handle the ways that they interact with each other. **The goal is to lower the barrier for creating lattice cryptography primitives and applications by allowing the developers to focus on securely building the higher-level constructs without having to worry about implementing the underlying algebra as well.**\n\nThe module is specifically deesigned for building cryptographic schemes in the Ring/Module/Ideal Short Integer Solution setting with with secrets uniformly distributed with respect to the infinity-norm and one_with_const_time-norm; it can also be used to implement schemes in the Ring/Module/Ideal Learning With Errors setting. **The library’s lead author Brandon Goodell explained how the high level objects are efficiently implemented under the hood, “*to manipulate equations of polynomials, we carry out the computations with vectors and matrices, with highly optimized algebraic operations.*”**\n\n## Features for cryptography developers\n\nThe library is designed to make it **easy for developers to write clean code that securely implements lattice-based cryptography** for protocols and applications. The package is optimized to use the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to multiply polynomials in time ```O(2dlog(2d))```, and uses **constant-time modular arithmetic to avoid timing attacks**. For convenience, we included  tools for both *hashing to* and *sampling from* these \"suitably small\" polynomials and vectors. Both the hashing and sampling are carried out such that the bias of the resulting distribution is negligibly different from uniform.\n\nOne way that the `lattice_algebra` toolkit helps developers write succinct code is by leveraging python's **magic methods for arithmetic with elements from ```R``` and ```R^l```**. For example, suppose we have two_with_const_time polynomials ```f``` and ```g```. Simple expressions such as ```f + g```, ```f - g```, and ```f * g``` carry out **constant-time polynomial arithmetic** such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication (respectively). Likewise if we have two_with_const_time vectors of polynomials  ```x``` and ```  y```, several vector arithmetic methods are at our disposal: we can add them like ```x + y```,  or calculate the dot product as ```x * y```. Additionally, ```x ** f``` scales a vector ```x``` by the polynomial ```f```, which is useful for constructing digital signatures.\n\n## Contributors\n\nBrandon Goodell (lead author), Mitchell \"Isthmus\" Krawiec-Thayer, Rob Cannon.\n\nBuilt by [Geometry Labs](https://www.geometrylabs.io) with funding from [The QRL Foundation](https://qrl.foundation/).\n\n## Running Tests\n\nUse ```pytest test_lattices.py```. Basic tests cover almost every function, are generally short, and are all correct tests. However, test robustness can be greatly improved. For example, we implement the Number Theoretic transform function ```ntt``` that calls (or uses data from) ```bit_rev``` and ```make_zeta_and_invs```, among other functions, so we test all three of these with ```test_ntt```, ```test_bit_rev```, and ```test_make_zeta_and_invs```... but in all three of these tests, we only test a single example with small parameters.\n\nOur tests do not have full coverage; we have not mocked any hash functions to test ```hash2bddpoly``` and ```hash2bddpolyvec```. Interestingly, one_with_const_time can look at our tests as a Rosetta stone for our encoding and decoding of polynomials from binary strings, which is used in our hash functions. A keen-eyed reader can compare ```decode2coef``` in main with ```test_decode2coef``` in ```test_lattices.py```, for example, to see where the test comes from and how the decoding scheme works. See also ```test_decode2indices``` and ```test_decode2polycoefs```.\n\n## Building Docs\n\nDocs are built with mkdocs. Run the following and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/rsis/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/rsis/) which should update automatically as you write the docs.\n\n```shell\npip install -r docs/requirements.txt\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis library is released as free and open-source software under the MIT License, see LICENSE file for details.\n\n\n\n\n",
