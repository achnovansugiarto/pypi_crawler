If no address is assigned to the warehouse\n  the module will automatically use the address of the company as its origin.\n  Location code will automatically populate with the warehouse code\n  but can be modified if needed.\n\n- Hide Exemption & Tax Based on shipping address -- this will provide this\n  feature support at sale order level.\n\n\nTax Exemption Status\n\n- Tax exemption status can be defined on Contacts.\n\n- In a multi-company environment, the exemption status is defined per\n  Company, since each individual company is required to secure the\n  exemption certificates to claim for exemption application,\n  and this may not be the case for all Companies.\n\n- If the customer is tax exempt, in the \"Avatax\" tab, check the \"Is Tax Exempt\" checkbox.\n  When checked, the exemption details can be provided.\n  The Exemption Code is the type of exemption,\n  and the Exemption Number is an identification number to use on the customer's State.\n\n- This exemption status will only be applied for delivery addresses\n  in the State matching the State of the exemption address.\n  The same customer can have exemptiions on several states.\n  For this use additional Contact/Addresses for those states,\n  and enter the exempention details there.\n\n- To make this data management simpler, is it possible to set the customer as exempt\n  country wide, using the corresponding checkbox. In this case the exemption status will\n  be used for delivery addresses in any state. Using this option has compliance risks, so\n  plase use it with care.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues/new?body=module:%20account_avatax_sale_oca%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Open Source Integrators\n* Fabrice Henrion\n* Sodexis\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo SA\n\n  * Fabrice Henrion\n\n* Open Source Integrators (https://opensourceintegrators.com)\n\n  * Daniel Reis <dreis@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Bhavesh Odedra <bodedra@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Sandip Mangukiya <smangukiya@opensourceintegrators.com>\n\n* Serpent CS\n\n  * Murtuza Saleh\n\n* Sodexis\n\n  * Atchuthan Ubendran\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-dreispt| image:: https://github.com/dreispt.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/dreispt\n    :alt: dreispt\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-dreispt| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-fiscal-rule <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/tree/14.0/account_avatax_sale_oca>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
