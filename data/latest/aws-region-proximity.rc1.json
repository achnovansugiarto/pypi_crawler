    "description": "# AWS Region Proximity\n\nPrint a JSON dictionary where the key is an AWS region code name (us-west-2,\neu-central-1, etc.), and the value is a list of regions in order of their\nphysical proximity to the region. You may optionally pass in a list of region\ncode names that you have a copy of the resource in. The results will have the\nsame keys, but the lists will only contain the regions you specified.\n\n## Why?\n\nSay you have S3 buckets being cross-region-replicated in `us-west-2`,\n`eu-central-1`, and `ap-southeast-1` and you want to put a Cloudfront\ndistribution in front of them. You can use a Lambda@Edge with an Origin Request\ntrigger to change the origin that Cloudfront will pull a resource from.\nLambda@Edge has the environment variable `AWS_REGION`, which will tell you the\nclosest region to where your Lambda is executing. You could then use the list\ngenerated by this program to help find the nearest origin that can handle the\nrequest.\n\nFor example, a request comes in to the **DFW** edge location. The environment\nvariable `AWS_REGION` is `\"us-east-1\"` (the AWS region associated with the edge\nlocation of **DFW**). You don't have a copy of the resource in `us-east-1`, but\nyou do have a copy in `us-west-2`. So that can be the copy you return (as\nopposed to your copy in `eu-central-1` or `ap-southeast-1`).\n\n## Install\n```sh\npip install aws-region-proximity\n```\n\n## Usage\n### Get the Closest Regions for All Regions\n```sh\naws-regions\n```\n### Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"us-east-1\": [\n        \"us-east-1\",\n        \"us-east-2\",\n        \"ca-central-1\",\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"us-west-1\",\n        \"eu-west-1\",\n        \"eu-west-2\",\n        \"eu-west-3\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"eu-north-1\",\n        \"eu-south-1\",\n        \"sa-east-1\",\n        \"ap-northeast-1\",\n        \"me-south-1\",\n        \"cn-north-1\",\n        \"ap-northeast-2\",\n        \"cn-northwest-1\",\n        \"af-south-1\",\n        \"ap-south-1\",\n        \"ap-east-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-2\"\n    ],\n    ...\n    \"cn-northwest-1\": [\n        \"cn-northwest-1\",\n        \"cn-north-1\",\n        \"ap-east-1\",\n        \"ap-northeast-2\",\n        \"ap-northeast-1\",\n        \"ap-south-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\",\n        \"me-south-1\",\n        \"eu-north-1\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"eu-south-1\",\n        \"eu-west-2\",\n        \"eu-west-3\",\n        \"eu-west-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-2\",\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"us-west-1\",\n        \"ca-central-1\",\n        \"us-east-2\",\n        \"us-east-1\",\n        \"af-south-1\",\n        \"sa-east-1\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Get Closest Specified Regions per Region\nFor when you have copies in a limited number of regions and just want to see\nyour closest available region given some other region.\n\n```sh\naws-regions us-west-2 eu-central-1 ap-southeast-1\n```\n\n#### Output\n```json\n{\n    \"us-east-1\": [\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\"\n    ],\n    \"us-east-2\": [\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\"\n    ],\n    \"us-west-1\": [\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\"\n    ],\n    \"us-west-2\": [\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\"\n    ],\n    \"eu-west-1\": [\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"us-west-2\",\n        \"ap-southeast-1\"\n    ],\n    ...\n    \"cn-north-1\": [\n        \"ap-southeast-1\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"us-west-2\"\n    ],\n    \"cn-northwest-1\": [\n        \"ap-southeast-1\",\n        \"eu-central-1\",\n        \"us-west-2\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThere is still a key for every region, but the list of the closest regions is\nlimited to those specified on the command line.\n\n## From Whence Comes This Data?\nThis Gist: https://gist.github.com/atyachin/a011edf76df66c5aa1eac0cdca412ea9\n\nInstead of geographic coordinates, it'd probably be better if we sorted by \nactual inter-region latency, like what this table has: \nhttps://www.cloudping.co/grid\n\nPut it on the TODO list.\n\n\n",
