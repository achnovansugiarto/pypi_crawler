    "description": "\n\nBENT: Biomedical Entity Annotator\n---------------------------------\n\nPython Library for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Linking (NEL) in the biomedical domain.\n\nNER models are based on `PubMedBERT <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15779.pdf>`__ and the NEL model is a graph-based approach based on the Personalized PageRank algorithm and Information content.\n\nBENT can be used for: \n\n* Named Entity Recogniton (NER)\n* Named Entity Linking (NEL) \n* Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+NEL)\n\n:closed_book: `Documentation <https://bent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.\n\nCitation:\n\n* Pedro Ruas and Francisco M. Couto. `Nilinker: attention-based approach to nil entity linking <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046422001526>`__. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 132:104137, 2022. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104137.\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo use the current version of BENT it is required: \n\n* OS based on Ubuntu/Debian \n* Conda environment (using `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ or `Anaconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ )\n* Python>=3.7\n* Required space between 5.5 GB - 10 GB \n   * Dependencies: 2.5 GB \n   * Data: between 3.0 GB (base) or 7.5 GB (if you use all available knowlegde bases for NEL)\n\n\n.. note::\n\n   Please ensure that you have the appropriate version of Conda installed.\n\n\nCreate a Conda environment (adapt for the name of your project):\n\n::\n\n   conda create --name annotation_project python=3.7\n\n\nActivate the environment:\n\n::\n\n   conda activate annotation_project\n\n\nInstall the BENT package using pip:\n\n::\n\n   pip install bent\n\n\nAfter the pip installation, it is required a further step to install non-Python dependencies and to download the necessary data. Specify the knowledge bases that will be used:\n\n::\n\n   python -c \"from bent.setup_package import setup_package;setup_package([<kb1>, <kb2>, <kb3>])\"\n\n\nAvailable knowledge bases:\n\n* ‘medic’ (`MEDIC <http://ctdbase.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘do’ (`Disease ontology <https://disease-ontology.org/>`__)\n\n* 'chebi’ (`ChEBI ontology <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/>`__) \n\n* ‘ctd_chem’ (`CTD-Chemicals <http://ctdbase.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘ncbi_gene’ (`NCBI Gene <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/>`__)\n\n* ‘ctd_gene’ (`CTD-GENES <http://ctdbase.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘ncbi_taxon’ (`NCBI Taxonomy <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy>`__)\n\n* ‘go_bp’ (`Gene Ontology-Biological Process <http://geneontology.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘ctd_anat’ (`CTD-Anatomy <http://ctdbase.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘uberon’ (`UBERON ontology <http://obophenotype.github.io/uberon/>`__)\n\n* ‘go_cc’ (`Gene Ontology-Cellular Component <http://geneontology.org/>`__)\n\n* ‘cell_ontology’ (`Cell Ontology <https://cell-ontology.github.io/>`__)\n\n* cellosaurus’ (`Cellosaurus <https://www.cellosaurus.org/>`__)\n\n\nExample to download **only** the MEDIC vocabulary:\n\n::\n\n   python -c \"from bent.setup_package import setup_package;setup_package(['medic'])\"\n\n\nIf you want to download **all** knowledge bases, choose the option 'all':\n\n::\n\n   python -c \"from bent.setup_package import setup_package;setup_package(['all'])\"\n\n\nYou can download more knowledge bases later by:\n   \n   * specifying the desired knolwedge bases \n   * setting the argument 'only_kb_dicts' to True\n   * running the same command with these changes:\n\n\nExample:\n\n::\n\n   python -c \"from bent.setup_package import setup_package;setup_package(['chebi'], only_kb_dicts=True)\"\n\n\nReinitiate the conda environment.\n\n\nGet started\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo apply the complete pipeline of entity extraction (NER+NEL) set the arguments:\n\n* **recognize**: indicate that the NER module will be applied ('True')\n* **link**: indicate that the NEL module will be applied ('True')\n* **types**: entity types to recognize and the respective target knowledge bases.\n* **in_dir**: directory path containing the text files to be annotated (the directory must contain text files exclusively)\n* **out_dir**: the output directory that will contain the annotation files\n\n\nExample:\n\n::\n\n   import bent.annotate as bt\n\n   bt.annotate(\n           recognize=True,\n           link=True,\n           types={\n            'disease': 'medic'\n            'chemical': 'chebi',\n            'gene': 'ncbi_gene',\n            'anatomical': 'uberon',\n            'cell_line': 'cellosaurus',\n            'bioprocess': 'go_bp'\n            },\n           in_dir='input/txt/',\n           out_dir='output/nel/'\n   )\n\n\nIt is also possible to apply the pipeline (NER+NEL) to a string or a list or strings instantiated in the execution script.\n\nTo see more usage examples, access the `documentation <https://bent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`__.\n",
