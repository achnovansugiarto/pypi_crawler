    "description": "What Is 'twander'?\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n'twander' is a macro-programmable Filesystem Browser that runs on\r\nboth Unix-like systems as well as Win32 systems.  It embraces the best\r\nideas of both similar GUI-driven programs (Konqueror, Windows\r\nExplorer) as well as text-based interfaces (Midnight Commander, List,\r\nSweep).\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, If You Prefer The \"Elevator Pitch\"\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n'twander' is:\r\n\r\n   - A better file browser for Unix and Win32. (Developed on FreeBSD.)\r\n   - A way to make browsing the same on all the OSs you use.\r\n   - A macro-programmable tool that lets *you* define the features.\r\n   - A GUI navigation front-end for your shell.\r\n   - A way to \"can\" workflows for your technically-challenged colleagues.\r\n   - A way to free yourself from the shackles of the mouse.\r\n   - A way to significantly speed up your day-to-day workflow.\r\n   - A Python/Tkinter application - over 5000 lines of code/comments\r\n   - A RCT (Really Cool Tool) that will have you addicted in a day or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is 'twander' Different?\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile the 'twander' interface is graphical, all the major navigation,\r\nselection, and execution commands can be entered from the keyboard,\r\nnot just the mouse.  This means Power Users who are strong typists can\r\nminimize dependency on the mouse and materially speed up their\r\ninteractions with the system.\r\n\r\nMoreover, unlike the other programs, 'twander' does not have a\r\nbuilt-in set of commands (which typically cannot be changed).\r\nInstead, 'twander' supports a rich macro configuration language for\r\nvirtually limitless user-definition of commands.  The configuration\r\nlanguage provides a simple mechanism for communicating the list of\r\nitems currently selected in the GUI to the user-defined commands.\r\n\r\nEach user is thus free to configure a command set unique and\r\nappropriate to their needs.  As with the navigation commands,\r\nuser-defined commands can be invoked with either the keyboard (a\r\nsingle keystroke) or the mouse (a menu selection).\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Might Like 'twander'?\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n1) People who type well and find the mouse a distraction when working.\r\n\r\n2) People who want to customize the commands available in their file\r\n   browser to do things *their* way instead of the way the browser\r\n   wants to do things.\r\n\r\n3) People who wish to provide their less technical colleagues with a\r\n   tool that has a limited set of \"canned\" features.  For instance, it\r\n   would be trivial to use 'twander' to automate ftp transfers for use\r\n   by non-technical administrative staff.\r\n\r\n4) People interested in the inner workings of a Python/Tkinter\r\n   program.  The entire program is written in Python using the Tkinter\r\n   GUI modules and is extensively commented throughout.  Additional\r\n   program documentation is provided in Unix 'man' format, PostScript,\r\n   pdf, html, and plain text.\r\n\r\n5) Oddly, and as an unintended side-effect of the original design,\r\n   'twander' will serve the visually-impaired very well.  Colors, font\r\n   type, size, & weight, and window size can all be trivially set in\r\n   the 'twander' Configuration File.  Additionally, font size can be\r\n   increased or decreased with a single keystroke while the program is\r\n   running.  So, for instance, it is quite easy to run the program\r\n   with very large fonts, thus improving readability.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgram Requirements\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n'twander' runs on Unix-like systems (FreeBSD, Linux) as well as a\r\nvariety of Win32 systems.  It requires the presence of Python 2.2 (or\r\nlater) and the associated Tkinter support for the target system.\r\nAdditional features for Win32 users are enabled if you also install\r\nthe 'win32all' Python extensions from Mark Hammond.  All of these are\r\nfreely available from:\r\n\r\n         http://www.python.org\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, *you* should be technically proficient - either as a\r\nPower User or Programmer.  A good benchmark here is that you are\r\ncurrently comfortable with the command line (shell) environment of\r\nyour chosen OS, and are knowlegeable about scripting in that\r\nenvironment (shell scripts or batch files).  ('twander' does not\r\nrequire such scripts, but this level of technical knowledge is about\r\nright for creating 'twander' command macros.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMailing List\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTundraWare Inc. runs an email list for 'twander' users.  Instructions\r\non how to subscribe can be found in the documentation.",
