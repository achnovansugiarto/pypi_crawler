    "description": "Shift Happens: Crowdsourcing metrics and test datasets beyond ImageNet\n======================================================================\n\nWelcome! This is the official code for the ICML 2022 workshop on crowdsourcing \nnovel metrics and test datasets for model evaluation on ImageNet scale.\n\nWhile the popularity of robustness benchmarks and new test datasets\nincreased over the past years, the performance of computer vision models\nis still largely evaluated on ImageNet directly, or on simulated or\nisolated distribution shifts like in ImageNet-C. \n\n**Goal:** This workshop aims to enhance and consolidate the landscape of robustness evaluation datasets for\ncomputer vision and collect new test sets and metrics for quantifying desirable or problematic\nproperties of computer vision models. Our goal is to bring the robustness, domain\nadaptation, and out-of-distribution detection communities together to work on a new\n**broad-scale benchmark** that tests diverse aspects of current computer\nvision models and guides the way towards the next generation of models.\n\nOver the course of the workshop, the package will be populated with new tasks, metrics\nand datasets that are suitable for understanding the properties of ImageNet scaled\ncomputer vision models beyond the metrics that are typically reported.\n\nHow to use this benchmark\n-------------------------\nFor now, you can use the benchmark by installing it from this repository:\n\n.. code::\n\n    $ pip install git+https://github.com/shift-happens-benchmark/icml-2022.git\n\nAfter the workshop you will be able to use this package and all its included tasks with:\n\n.. code::\n    \n    $ pip install shifthappens\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nSince the aim of this workshop & package is to build a unified platform for datasets\ninvestigating and highlighting interesting properties of ImageNet-scale vision models,\nwe are looking for **your** contribution. If you decide to contribute a new task to the \nbenchmark before ICML 2022 please consider officially submitting it to the workshop - for\nmore details see `here <https://shift-happens-benchmark.github.io/call_for_papers.html>`_.\n\n\nAdding tasks and datasets\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTasks in this benchmark package should highlight interesting properties of vision models.\nFor one, this means that you can integrate new datasets you built. In addition, you can also\npropose new evaluation schemes (i.e. new tasks) for already existing datasets, like test-time adaptation evaluation\non robustness datasets. You can think about examples/scenarios that might be of interest for industrial\napplications just as well as purely academic examples - as long as the new tasks/datasets highlight \nan interesting behavior of existing models, it fits into this package! \n\nNew tasks should be added to the ``shifthappens.tasks`` module.\n\nPlease refer to the `API documentation <https://shift-happens-benchmark.github.io/api.html>`_ for \nmore details, as well as minimal examples. Moreover, inside the `examples <examples>`_ folder you can \nfind implementations example implementations of tasks for the benchmark.\n\nAdding models\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nModels should be added to the ``shifthappens.models`` module. An example implementation\nfor wrapping a torchvision model is given in ``shifthappens.models.torchvision``. Note\nthat implementations are framework agnostic; further options include TensorFlow, and jax\nmodels, for which we will add example implementations soon.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nAll code in this repository is released under an Apache 2.0 license, which includes\nexternal contributions. All data used for creating new benchmarks should minimally be\navailable without constrains for research purposes, and optionally free for commercial \nuse as well.\n\nDatasets `without an explicit license statement <https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/>`_ \nwill not be accepted into the benchmark.\n",
