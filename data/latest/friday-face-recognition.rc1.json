    "description": "Face Recognition\n================\n\n| Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line\n  with\n| the world's simplest face recognition library.\n\n| Built using `dlib <http://dlib.net/>`__'s state-of-the-art face\n  recognition\n| built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the\n| `Labeled Faces in the Wild <http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/>`__\n  benchmark.\n\n| This also provides a simple ``face_recognition`` command line tool\n  that lets\n| you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!\n\n| |PyPI|\n| |Build Status|\n| |Documentation Status|\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nFind faces in pictures\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFind all the faces that appear in a picture:\n\n|image3|\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import face_recognition\n    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"your_file.jpg\")\n    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n\nFind and manipulate facial features in pictures\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nGet the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and\nchin.\n\n|image4|\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import face_recognition\n    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"your_file.jpg\")\n    face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)\n\n| Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff.\n  But you can also use for really stupid stuff\n| like applying `digital\n  make-up <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py>`__\n  (think 'Meitu'):\n\n|image5|\n\nIdentify faces in pictures\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nRecognize who appears in each photo.\n\n|image6|\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import face_recognition\n    known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"biden.jpg\")\n    unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"unknown.jpg\")\n\n    biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]\n    unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]\n\n    results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)\n\nYou can even use this library with other Python libraries to do\nreal-time face recognition:\n\n|image7|\n\nSee `this\nexample <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py>`__\nfor the code.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nRequirements:\n\n-  Python 3+ or Python 2.7\n-  macOS or Linux (Windows untested)\n-  `Also can run on a Raspberry Pi 2+ (follow these specific\n   instructions) <https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65>`__\n-  A `pre-configured VM\n   image <https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b>`__\n   is also available.\n\nInstall this module from pypi using ``pip3`` (or ``pip2`` for Python 2):\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip3 install face_recognition\n\n| IMPORTANT NOTE: It's very likely that you will run into problems when\n  pip tries to compile\n| the ``dlib`` dependency. If that happens, check out this guide to\n  installing\n| dlib from source (instead of from pip) to fix the error:\n\n`How to install dlib from\nsource <https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf>`__\n\n| After manually installing ``dlib``, try running\n  ``pip3 install face_recognition``\n| again to complete your installation.\n\n| If you are still having trouble installing this, you can also try out\n  this\n| `pre-configured\n  VM <https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b>`__.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCommand-Line Interface\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n| When you install ``face_recognition``, you get a simple command-line\n  program\n| called ``face_recognition`` that you can use to recognize faces in a\n| photograph or folder full for photographs.\n\n| First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person\n  you\n| already know. There should be one image file for each person with the\n| files named according to who is in the picture:\n\n|known|\n\nNext, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:\n\n|unknown|\n\n| Then in you simply run the command ``face_recognition``, passing in\n| the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with\n  unknown\n| people and it tells you who is in each image:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\n\n| There's one line in the output for each face. The data is\n  comma-separated\n| with the filename and the name of the person found.\n\n| An ``unknown_person`` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone\n  in\n| your folder of known people.\n\nAdjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity\n'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\n| If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be\n  that\n| the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance\n  value\n| is needed to make face comparisons more strict.\n\n| You can do that with the ``--tolerance`` parameter. The default\n  tolerance\n| value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\n\n| If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in\n  order\n| to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use ``--show-distance true``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785\n    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None\n\nMore Examples\n'''''''''''''\n\n| If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph\n  but don't\n| care about file names, you could do this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2\n\n    Barack Obama\n    unknown_person\n\nSpeeding up Face Recognition\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\n| Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with\n| multiple CPU cores. For example if your system has 4 CPU cores, you\n  can\n| process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by\n  using\n| all your CPU cores in parallel.\n\nIf you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a\n``--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>`` parameter:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ face_recognition -cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\nYou can also pass in ``--cpus -1`` to use all CPU cores in your system.\n\nPython Module\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n| You can import the ``face_recognition`` module and then easily\n  manipulate\n| faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!\n\nAPI Docs:\n`https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io <https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html>`__.\n\nAutomatically find all the faces in an image\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import face_recognition\n\n    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"my_picture.jpg\")\n    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n\n    # face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!\n\n| See `this\n  example <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py>`__\n| to try it out.\n\nYou can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face\ndetection model.\n\n| Note: GPU acceleration (via nvidia's CUDA library) is required for\n  good\n| performance with this model.

It tends to mix\n   up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.\n\nDeployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n| Since ``face_recognition`` depends on ``dlib`` which is written in\n  C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app\n| using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.\n\n| To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that\n  shows how to run an app built with\n| ``face_recognition`` in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__\n  container. With that, you should be able to deploy\n| to any service that supports Docker images.\n\nCommon Issues\n-------------\n\nIssue: ``Illegal instruction (core dumped)`` when using\nface\\_recognition or running examples.\n\n| Solution: ``dlib`` is compiled with SSE4 or AVX support, but your CPU\n  is too old and doesn't support that.\n| You'll need to recompile ``dlib`` after `making the code change\n  outlined\n  here <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-287398611>`__.\n\nIssue:\n``RuntimeError: Unsupported image type, must be 8bit gray or RGB image.``\nwhen running the webcam examples.\n\nSolution: Your webcam probably isn't set up correctly with OpenCV. `Look\nhere for\nmore <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/21#issuecomment-287779524>`__.\n\nIssue: ``MemoryError`` when running ``pip2 install face_recognition``\n\n| Solution: The face\\_recognition\\_models file is too big for your\n  available pip cache memory. Instead,\n| try ``pip2 --no-cache-dir install face_recognition`` to avoid the\n  issue.\n\nIssue:\n``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'``\n\nSolution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old. You\nneed version 19.4 or newer. Upgrade ``dlib``.\n\nIssue: ``TypeError: imread() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'``\n\nSolution: The version of ``scipy`` you have installed is too old. You\nneed version 0.17 or newer. Upgrade ``scipy``.\n\nThanks\n------\n\n-  Many, many thanks to `Davis King <https://github.com/davisking>`__\n   (`@nulhom <https://twitter.com/nulhom>`__)\n   for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature\n   detection and face encoding models\n   used in this library.
