    "description": "Pygame Extended (or pygext) is my \"everything and a kitchen sink\" collection\nof libraries for Pygame development. The main part of pygext, is the OpenGL\naccelerated 2D framework (pygext.gl) for rendering and controlling sprites.\nPygext also contains additions to pygame.draw (e.g. rectangles with\nround corners) and an opengl accelerated 2D vector graphics library\n(experimental).\n\nPygext is currently 100% pure Python, so parts of it might still be a bit\nslow on less than high end PCs. However, I've tried to design the code to\nbe as psyco-friendly as possible, so you will see quite a noticeable\ndifference with psyco enabled. Remember to add import psyco; psyco.profile()\nat the beginning of your applications.\n\nMain Features\n\n* Use layers to control rendering order (unlimited layers per scene)\n* Sprites you can rotate, scale and alpha blend\n* Sprites can be attached to each other for synchronized movement\n* Framerate independent animation and movement\n* Control sprites via \"Actions\" instead of manually updating coordinates every frame\n* Fully featured particle effects\n* Collision detection\n* Scenes and states for structuring game logic\n\nNOTE: this release of pygext is still alpha, so there will be backward\nincompatible API changes and refactoring in future versions.",
