    "description": "====================\nDjango Rapyd Wiretap\n====================\n\nLogs requests and responses to your application in a DB for auditing or troubleshooting purposes.\n\nInspiration\n-----------\n\nThis is heavily inspired by and borrows a lot from `nathforge/django-wiretap <https://github.com/nathforge/django-wiretap>`_.\n\n**Why a new package?**\n\nThe fundamental difference is not letting ``settings.DEBUG`` determine if a message should be tapped. I have needs, yes in *PRODUCTION*, where this is useful to me.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n- Install the package with:\n  ::\n\n    pip install django-rapyd-wiretap\n\n- Edit Django settings:\n\n  - Add ``wiretap`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n  - Add ``wiretap.middleware.WiretapMiddleware`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``.\n\n- Create models with:\n  ::\n\n    ./manage.py migrate\n\n- Go to Django admin, add a new ``Tap``.\n\n  - This contains a ``path``, which is matched against the full path including the query string. A valid regex is allowed here.\n  - For example, to capture everything within the ``/api/`` path of your site, use ``^/api/``.\n  - To capture everything, set it to ``/``.\n\nTo Do\n-----\n\n- Add support for configuring retention per tap and deleting older messages.\n- Add support for prettifying major content types for easy troubleshooting.\n- Delegate logging request and response bodies to a separate file on the file system keeping the DB lean for faster queries. Maybe? I'm still divided on this.\n- I'm sure there are other things I haven't thought of yet or those that will be needed by the community.\n",
