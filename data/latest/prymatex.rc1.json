    "description": "Prymatex Text Editor\n--------------------\n\nWhat is Prymatex\n================\n\nPrymatex is a simple and flexible text editor. It's written in PyQt4 and\nit's main aim is to support TextMate bundles.\n\nWhy Prymatex?\n=============\n\nThere are *enough* text editors out there, and many of them are\nfocused on writing code, just to name a few, Notepad++, Kate, Gedit,\nScribes, etc.\n\nThese editors are great, but the way they are way they are extended is\ncomplex for non C/C++ programmers (although this is changing gradually).\nThat's where TextMate comes into place. It allows the user to define syntaxes, \nsnippets, macros and commands in a very simple way, using \nshell scripting, Ruby, Python, PHP or any other tool wich can handle\nshell variables and stdin/stdout pipes.\n\nThere are a lots of these extensions (actually called Bundles) maintained by\nenthusiasts. From Ruby on Rails, to OpenGL programming, these bundles come\nwith 3 basic components:\n\n    * **Syntax** An extensible syntax format (allowing inclusion/usage, ie: PHP includes HTML and JS)\n\n    * **Commands** They're like what we all know as marcros\n\n    * **Snippets** Pieces of text that can be tirggered in certain situations\n\n    * **Templates** File templates\n    \n\nRunning Prymatex\n================\n\nSee INSTALL.rst to setup your enviroment.",
