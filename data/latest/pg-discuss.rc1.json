    "description": "======================\nWelcome to pg-discuss!\n======================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/sprin/pg-discuss.svg\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/sprin/pg-discuss\n\npg-discuss is a comment system backend written in Python on top of a\n`PostgreSQL`_ database. It is designed to support JavaScript comment widgets\nembedded in any page, such as static sites generated by `Pelican`_, `Sphinx`_,\nor `Nikola`_. pg-discuss can also be used with a content management system such\nas `WordPress`_, or within your own dynamic web app that needs a robust comment\nsystem.\n\n.. _`PostgreSQL`: http://www.postgresql.org/\n.. _`Pelican`: http://getpelican.com/\n.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx-doc.org/\n.. _`Nikola`: https://getnikola.com/\n.. _`WordPress`: https://wordpress.org/\n\n\n   - `Demo`_\n   - `Features`_\n   - `Installation`_\n   - `Configuration`_\n   - `Internals`_ (for Extension Authors and Contributors)\n\n.. _Demo: https://pg-discuss.sprin.io/en/latest/demo.html\n.. _Features: https://pg-discuss.sprin.io/en/latest/features.html\n.. _Installation: https://pg-discuss.sprin.io/en/latest/installation.html\n.. _Configuration: https://pg-discuss.sprin.io/en/latest/configuration.html\n.. _Internals: https://pg-discuss.sprin.io/en/latest/internals/index.html\n\nWhy pg-discuss?\n===============\n\nRespect for Users\n-----------------\n\npg-discuss has a feature set comparable to popular commercial comment\nmanagement systems. However, pg-discuss does not sell your users' browsing\nhabits and comments to marketers. You have full control over how your users'\ninformation is used.\n\nPermissively-Licensed Open Source\n---------------------------------\n\npg-discuss is a MIT-licensed open source project that allows you to\noperate, extend, and redistribute the application as you see fit. Contributions\nare welcome.\n\nSupports Multiple JavaScript Widgets\n------------------------------------\n\nThe pg-discuss API can be adapted to work with existing embeddable comment\nwidgets. Of course, new widgets can also be written using the default REST\nAPI.\n\nExtensible\n----------\n\nThe application is highly extensible, with most default features implemented as\nextensions which are bundled. Extensions can change the comment workflow,\ncomment metadata collection, rendering engine, authentication, and HTTP API\nformat and endpoints. Extensions are implemented using a simple API that\nexposes logical plugpoints and events.\n\nSmall and Readable Codebase\n---------------------------\n\nThe core package of pg-discuss is less than 1000 lines. Code is structured\nfor readability, conforms to PEP8, and has ample comments. It is written to\nbe very approachable for both auditors and extension developers. Both prose\nand API documentation of internals are published.\n\nRobust and Performant Database\n------------------------------\n\nPostgreSQL offers strong data guarantees, ease of management, and high\nperformance. pg-discuss is written to take advantage of several\nPostgreSQL-specific features that enable flexible extension and low latency\nquerying.\n\nAvailable and Scalable\n----------------------\n\nThe pg-discuss application can be deployed across many hosts for redundancy or\nload balancing since it does not store any application state itself - all state\nis held in the PostgreSQL database or in the client browser session. pg-discuss\nalso plays well with HTTP caches such as nginx, and a simple extension can\ninform the cache when to purge stale objects.\n\npg-discuss alternatives\n=======================\n\nThere are several good alternatives to pg-discuss that are also open source,\nbut have somewhat different design goals.\n\nIsso\n----\n\nPerhaps you don't want to run a database?\n\n`Isso`_ is an excellent SQLite-backed comment server - there is no separate\ndatabase instance to run, since the data is stored in a file. Also written\nin Python. MIT licensed.\n\n.. _Isso: http://posativ.org/isso/\n\nDiscourse\n---------\n\nNeed a comment widget that also has file uploads, polling, private messaging,\nanalytics, all out of the box?\n\n`Discourse`_ is a discussion platform with a `long list of features`_, with a\nRuby on Rails backend on top of PostgreSQL. GNU GPL v2 licensed.\n\n.. _Discourse: http://www.discourse.org/\n.. _long list of features: http://www.discourse.org/about/\n",
