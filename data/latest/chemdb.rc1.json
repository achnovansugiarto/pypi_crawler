    "description": ".. -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nChemdb is a chemical inventory system written in Python_ using the\nDjango_ framework.  It makes it easy for us to keep track of what we\nhave in the lab.  It also generates the required safety information\nautomatically (door warnings and inventories).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nPackages\n--------\n\nGentoo\n~~~~~~\n\nI've packaged chemdb for Gentoo_.  You need layman_ and my `wtk\noverlay`_.  Install with::\n\n    # emerge -av app-portage/layman\n    # layman --add wtk\n    # emerge -av dev-python/chemdb\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nIf you're installing by hand or packaging calibcant for another\ndistribution, you'll need the following dependencies:\n\n===========  =================  ===================================\nPackage      Debian_            Gentoo_\n===========  =================  ===================================\nDjango_      python-django      dev-python/django\nGrappelli_                      dev-python/django-grappelli [#wtk]_\n===========  =================  ===================================\n\n.. [#wtk] In the `wtk overlay`_.\n\nInstalling by hand\n------------------\n\nChemdb is available as a Git_ repository::\n\n    $ git clone git://tremily.us/chemdb.git\n\nSee the homepage_ for details.  To install the checkout, run the\nstandard::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nIf you don't have a Django project and you just want to run chemdb as\na stand-alone service, you can use the example project written up in\n``example``.  Set up the project (once)::\n\n  $ python example/manage.py syncdb\n\nSee the `Django documentation`_ for more details.\n\nYou may also want to load some example data, to make your initial\nbrowsing more interesting::\n\n  $ python example/manage.py loaddata example_data\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nRun the app on your local host (as many times as you like)::\n\n  $ python example/manage.py runserver\n\nYou may need to add the current directory to ``PYTHONPATH`` so\n``python`` can find the ``chemdb`` package.  If you're running\n``bash``, that will look like::\n\n  $ PYTHONPATH=\".:$PYTHONPATH\" python example/manage.py runserver\n\nHacking\n=======\n\nThis project was largely build following the `Django tutorial`_.\nThat's a good place to start if you're new to Django.\n\nOther resources\n===============\n\nYou can `search CAS Registry numbers`_ at NIST.  This is useful for\ndecoding MSDS information.\n\nNFPA fire diamond\n-----------------\n\nThese are the meanings of the various NFPA warnings:\n\n* Blue: Health Hazard\n\n  0. Hazard no greater than ordinary material\n  1. May cause irritation; minimal residual injury\n  2. Intense or prolonged exposure may cause incapacitation;\n     Residual injury may occur if not treated\n  3. Exposure could cause serious injury even if treated\n  4. Exposure may cause death\n\n* Red: Fire Hazard\n\n  0. Will not burn\n  1. Must be preheated for ignition; flashpoint above 200°F (93°C)\n  2. Must be moderately heated for ignition, flashpoint above 100°F (38°C)\n  3. Ignition may occur under most ambient conditions,\n     Flashpoint below 100°F (38°C)\n  4. Extremely flammable and will readily disperse through air under\n     standard conditions, flashpoint below 73°F (23°C)\n\n* Reactivity hazards:\n\n  0. Stable\n  1. May become unstable at elevated temperatures and pressures.\n     May be mildly water reactive\n  2. Unstable; may undergo violent decomposition, but will not detonate.\n     May form explosive mixtures with water\n  3. Detonates with strong ignition source\n  4. Readily detonates\n\n* Special Hazards have the following codes:\n\n  * OX   strong oxidizer\n  * W̶    water reactive\n  * SA   simple asphyxiants (The only gases for which this symbol is\n    permitted are nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon.)\n\nLicence\n=======\n\nThis project is distributed under the `GNU General Public License\nVersion 3`_ or greater.\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nW.
