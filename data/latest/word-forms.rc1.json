It can conjugate verbs. It can connect different\nparts of speeches e.g noun to adjective, adjective to adverb, noun to verb etc. It can pluralize singular nouns. It does this all in one function. Enjoy!\n\n## Examples\n\nSome very timely examples :-P\n\n```python\n>>> from word_forms.word_forms import get_word_forms\n>>> get_word_forms(\"president\")\n>>> {'n': {'presidents', 'presidentships', 'presidencies', 'presidentship', 'president', 'presidency'},\n     'a': {'presidential'},\n     'v': {'preside', 'presided', 'presiding', 'presides'},\n     'r': {'presidentially'}}\n>>> get_word_forms(\"elect\")\n>>> {'n': {'elects', 'electives', 'electors', 'elect', 'eligibilities', 'electorates', 'eligibility', 'elector', 'election', 'elections', 'electorate', 'elective'},\n     'a': {'eligible', 'electoral', 'elective', 'elect'},\n     'v': {'electing', 'elects', 'elected', 'elect'},\n     'r': set()}\n>>> get_word_forms(\"politician\")\n>>> {'n': {'politician', 'politics', 'politicians'},\n     'a': {'political'},\n     'v': set(),\n     'r': {'politically'}}\n>>> get_word_forms(\"am\")\n>>> {'n': {'being', 'beings'},\n     'a': set(),\n     'v': {'was', 'be', \"weren't\", 'am', \"wasn't\", \"aren't\", 'being', 'were', 'is', \"isn't\", 'been', 'are', 'am not'},\n     'r': set()}\n>>> get_word_forms(\"ran\")\n>>> {'n': {'run', 'runniness', 'runner', 'runninesses', 'running', 'runners', 'runnings', 'runs'},\n     'a': {'running', 'runny'},\n     'v': {'running', 'run', 'ran', 'runs'},\n     'r': set()}\n>>> get_word_forms('continent', 0.8) # with configurable similarity threshold\n>>> {'n': {'continents', 'continency', 'continences', 'continent', 'continencies', 'continence'},\n     'a': {'continental', 'continent'},\n     'v': set(),\n     'r': set()}\n```\nAs you can see, the output is a dictionary with four keys. \"r\" stands for adverb, \"a\" for adjective, \"n\" for noun\nand \"v\" for verb. Don't ask me why \"r\" stands for adverb. This is what WordNet uses, so this is why I use it too :-)\n\nHelp can be obtained at any time by typing the following:\n\n```python\n>>> help(get_word_forms)\n```\n\n## Why?\nIn Natural Language Processing and Search, one often needs to treat words like \"run\" and \"ran\", \"love\" and \"lovable\"\nor \"politician\" and \"politics\" as the same word. This is usually done by algorithmically reducing each word into a\nbase word and then comparing the base words. The process is called Stemming.\nFor example, the [Porter Stemmer](http://text-processing.com/demo/stem/) reduces both \"love\" and \"lovely\"\ninto the base word \"love\".\n\nStemmers have several shortcomings. Firstly, the base word produced by the Stemmer is not always a valid English word.\nFor example, the Porter Stemmer reduces the word \"operation\" to \"oper\". Secondly, the Stemmers have a high false negative rate.\nFor example, \"run\" is reduced to \"run\" and \"ran\" is reduced to \"ran\". This happens because the Stemmers use a set of\nrational rules for finding the base words, and as we all know, the English language does not always behave very rationally.\n\nLemmatizers are more accurate than Stemmers because they produce a base form that is present in the dictionary (also called the Lemma). So the reduced word is always a valid English word. However, Lemmatizers also have false negatives because they are not very good at connecting words across different parts of speeches. The [WordNet Lemmatizer](http://textanalysisonline.com/nltk-wordnet-lemmatizer) included with NLTK fails at almost all such examples. \"operations\" is reduced to \"operation\"  and \"operate\" is reduced to \"operate\".\n\nWord Forms tries to solve this problem by finding all possible forms of a given English word. It can perform verb conjugations, connect noun forms to verb forms, adjective forms, adverb forms, plularize singular forms etc.\n\n## Bonus: A simple lemmatizer\n\nWe also offer a very simple lemmatizer based on ``word_forms``. Here is how to use it.\n\n```python\n>>> from word_forms.lemmatizer import lemmatize\n>>> lemmatize(\"operations\")\n'operant'\n>>> lemmatize(\"operate\")\n'operant'\n```\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## Compatibility\n\nTested on Python 3\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing `pip`:\n\n```\npip install -U word_forms\n```\n\n### From source\nOr you can install it from source:\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/gutfeeling/word_forms.git\n```\n\n2. Install it using `pip` or `setup.py`\n\n```\npip install -e word_forms\n% or\ncd word_forms\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n1.

Feel free to get in touch with me\nat dibyachakravorty@gmail.com.\n\n## Contributors\n\n- Tom Aarsen @CubieDev is a major contributor and is singlehandedly responsible for v2.0.0.\n- Sajal Sharma @sajal2692 ia a major contributor.\n\n## Contributions\n\nWord Forms is not perfect. In particular, a couple of aspects can be improved.\n\n1. It sometimes generates non dictionary words like \"runninesses\" because the pluralization/singularization algorithm is\nnot perfect. At the moment, I am using [inflect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inflect) for it.\n\nIf you like this package, feel free to contribute. Your pull requests are most welcome.\n\n\n",
