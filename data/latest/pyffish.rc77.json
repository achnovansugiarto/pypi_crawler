It can play various regional, historical, and modern chess variants as well as [games with user-defined rules](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Variant-configuration). For [compatibility with graphical user interfaces](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Graphical-user-interfaces) it supports the UCI, UCCI, USI, UCI-cyclone, and CECP/XBoard protocols.\n\nThe goal of the project is to create an engine supporting a large variety of chess-like games, equipped with the powerful search of Stockfish. Despite its generality the [playing strength](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Playing-strength) is on a very high level in almost all supported variants. Due to its multi-protocol support Fairy-Stockfish works with almost any chess variant GUI.\n\n## Installation\nYou can download the [Windows executable](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest/download/fairy-stockfish-largeboard_x86-64.exe) or [Linux binary](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest/download/fairy-stockfish-largeboard_x86-64) from the [latest release](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest) or [compile the program from source](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish#compiling-stockfish-yourself-from-the-sources). The program comes without a graphical user interface, so you perhaps want to use it together with a [compatible GUI](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Graphical-user-interfaces), or [play against it online](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Online) at [pychess](https://www.pychess.org/), [lishogi](https://lishogi.org/@/Fairy-Stockfish), or [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Fairy-Stockfish). Read more about [how to use](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Usage) Fairy-Stockfish in the wiki.\n\nIf you want to preview the functionality of Fairy-Stockfish before downloading, you can try it out on the [Fairy-Stockfish playground](https://fairyground.vercel.app/) in the browser.\n\nOptional NNUE evaluation parameter files to improve playing strength for many variants are in the [list of NNUE networks](https://fairy-stockfish.github.io/nnue/#current-best-nnue-networks).\nFor the regional variants Xiangqi, Janggi, and Makruk [dedicated releases with built-in NNUE networks](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish-NNUE) are available. See the [wiki](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/NNUE) for more details on NNUE.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you like this project, please support its development via [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ianfab) or [paypal](https://paypal.me/FairyStockfish), by [contributing CPU time](https://github.com/ianfab/fishtest/wiki) to the framework for testing of code improvements, or by [contributing to the code](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Contributing) or documentation. An [introduction to the code base](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Understanding-the-code) can be found in the wiki.\n\n## Supported games\n\nThe games currently supported besides chess are listed below. Fairy-Stockfish can also play user-defined variants loaded via a variant configuration file, see the file [`src/variants.ini`](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/blob/master/src/variants.ini)

required information is not available, open an [issue](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/issues) or join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/FYUGgmCFB4).\n\n## Bindings\n\nBesides the C++ engine, this project also includes bindings for other programming languages in order to be able to use it as a library for chess variants. They support move, SAN, and FEN generation, as well as checking of game end conditions for all variants supported by Fairy-Stockfish. Since the bindings are using the C++ code, they are very performant compared to libraries directly written in the respective target language.\n\n### Python\n\nThe python binding [pyffish](https://pypi.org/project/pyffish/) contributed by [@gbtami](https://github.com/gbtami) is implemented in [pyffish.cpp](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/blob/master/src/pyffish.cpp). It is e.g. used in the backend for the [pychess server](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants).\n\n### Javascript\n\nThe javascript binding [ffish.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffish) contributed by [@QueensGambit](https://github.com/QueensGambit) is implemented in [ffishjs.cpp](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/blob/master/src/ffishjs.cpp). The compilation/binding to javascript is done using emscripten, see the [readme](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/tree/master/tests/js).\n\n## Ports\n\n### WebAssembly\n\nFor in-browser use a [port of Fairy-Stockfish to WebAssembly](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/fairy-stockfish.wasm) is available at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fairy-stockfish-nnue.wasm). It is e.g. used for local analysis on [pychess.org](https://www.pychess.org/analysis/chess). Also see the [Fairy-Stockfish WASM demo](https://github.com/ianfab/fairy-stockfish-nnue-wasm-demo) available at https://fairy-stockfish-nnue-wasm.vercel.app/.\n\n# Stockfish\n## Overview\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/actions/workflows/stockfish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/actions)\n[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/official-stockfish/Stockfish?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mcostalba/stockfish/branch/master)\n\n[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org) is a free, powerful UCI chess engine\nderived from Glaurung 2.1. Stockfish is not a complete chess program and requires a\nUCI-compatible graphical user interface (GUI) (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid,\nCute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order\nto be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information\nabout how to use Stockfish with it.\n\nThe Stockfish engine features two evaluation functions for chess, the classical\nevaluation based on handcrafted terms, and the NNUE evaluation based on efficiently\nupdatable neural networks. The classical evaluation runs efficiently on almost all\nCPU architectures, while the NNUE evaluation benefits from the vector\nintrinsics available on most CPUs (sse2, avx2, neon, or similar).\n\n\n## Files\n\nThis distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:\n\n  * [Readme.md](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/README.md), the file you are currently reading.\n\n  * [Copying.txt](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/Copying.txt), a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.\n\n  * [AUTHORS](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/AUTHORS), a text file with the list of authors for the project\n\n  * [src](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src), a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile\n    that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.\n\n  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE\n    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.\n\n## The UCI protocol and available options\n\nThe Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with\na chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces\n(GUI) or chess tools. Stockfish implements the majority of it options as described\nin [the UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip).\n\nDevelopers can see the default values for UCI options available in Stockfish by typing\n`./stockfish uci` in a terminal, but the majority of users will typically see them and\nchange them via a chess GUI. This is a list of available UCI options in Stockfish:\n\n  * #### Threads\n    The number of CPU threads used for searching a position. For best performance, set\n    this equal to the number of CPU cores available.\n\n  * #### Hash\n    The size of the hash table in MB. It is recommended to set Hash after setting Threads.\n\n  * #### Clear Hash\n    Clear the hash table.\n\n  * #### Ponder\n    Let Stockfish ponder its next move while the opponent is thinking.\n\n  * #### MultiPV\n    Output the N best lines (principal variations, PVs) when searching.\n    Leave at 1 for best performance.\n\n  * #### Use NNUE\n    Toggle between the NNUE and classical evaluation functions. If set to \"true\",\n    the network parameters must be available to load from file (see also EvalFile),\n    if they are not embedded in the binary.\n\n  * #### EvalFile\n    The name of the file of the NNUE evaluation parameters. Depending on the GUI the\n    filename might have to include the full path to the folder/directory that contains the file.\n    Other locations, such as the directory that contains the binary and the working directory,\n    are also searched.\n\n  * #### UCI_AnalyseMode\n    An option handled by your GUI.\n\n  * #### UCI_Chess960\n    An option handled by your GUI. If true, Stockfish will play Chess960.\n\n  * #### UCI_ShowWDL\n    If enabled, show approximate WDL statistics as part of the engine output.\n    These WDL numbers model expected game outcomes for a given evaluation and\n    game ply for engine self-play at fishtest LTC conditions (60+0.6s per game).\n\n  * #### UCI_LimitStrength\n    Enable weaker play aiming for an Elo rating as set by UCI_Elo. This option overrides Skill Level.\n\n  * #### UCI_Elo\n    If enabled by UCI_LimitStrength, aim for an engine strength of the given Elo.\n    This Elo rating has been calibrated at a time control of 60s+0.6s and anchored to CCRL 40/4.\n\n  * #### Skill Level\n    Lower the Skill Level in order to make Stockfish play weaker (see also UCI_LimitStrength).\n    Internally, MultiPV is enabled, and with a certain probability depending on the Skill Level a\n    weaker move will be played.\n\n  * #### SyzygyPath\n    Path to the folders/directories storing the Syzygy tablebase files. Multiple\n    directories are to be separated by \";\" on Windows and by \":\" on Unix-based\n    operating systems. Do not use spaces around the \";\" or \":\".\n\n    Example: `C:\\tablebases\\wdl345;C:\\tablebases\\wdl6;D:\\tablebases\\dtz345;D:\\tablebases\\dtz6`\n\n    It is recommended to store .rtbw files on an SSD. There is no loss in storing\n    the .rtbz files on a regular HD. It is recommended to verify all md5 checksums\n    of the downloaded tablebase files (`md5sum -c checksum.md5`) as corruption will\n    lead to engine crashes.\n\n  * #### SyzygyProbeDepth\n    Minimum remaining search depth for which a position is probed. Set this option\n    to a higher value to probe less aggressively if you experience too much slowdown\n    (in terms of nps) due to tablebase probing.\n\n  * #### Syzygy50MoveRule\n    Disable to let fifty-move rule draws detected by Syzygy tablebase probes count\n    as wins or losses. This is useful for ICCF correspondence games.\n\n  * #### SyzygyProbeLimit\n    Limit Syzygy tablebase probing to positions with at most this many pieces left\n    (including kings and pawns).\n\n  * #### Move Overhead\n    Assume a time delay of x ms due to network and GUI overheads. This is useful to\n    avoid losses on time in those cases.\n\n  * #### Slow Mover\n    Lower values will make Stockfish take less time in games, higher values will\n    make it think longer.\n\n  * #### nodestime\n    Tells the engine to use nodes searched instead of wall time to account for\n    elapsed time. Useful for engine testing.\n\n  * #### Debug Log File\n    Write all communication to and from the engine into a text file.\n\nFor developers the following non-standard commands might be of interest, mainly useful for debugging:\n\n  * #### bench *ttSize threads limit fenFile limitType evalType*\n    Performs a standard benchmark using various options. The signature of a version (standard node\n    count) is obtained using all defaults. `bench` is currently `bench 16 1 13 default depth mixed`.\n\n  * #### compiler\n    Give information about the compiler and environment used for building a binary.\n\n  * #### d\n    Display the current position, with ascii art and fen.\n\n  * #### eval\n    Return the evaluation of the current position.\n\n  * #### export_net [filename]\n    Exports the currently loaded network to a file.\n    If the currently loaded network is the embedded network and the filename\n    is not specified then the network is saved to the file matching the name\n    of the embedded network, as defined in evaluate.h.\n    If the currently loaded network is not the embedded network (some net set\n    through the UCI setoption) then the filename parameter is required and the\n    network is saved into that file.\n\n  * #### flip\n    Flips the side to move.\n\n\n## A note on classical evaluation versus NNUE evaluation\n\nBoth approaches assign a value to a position that is used in alpha-beta (PVS) search\nto find the best move. The classical evaluation computes this value as a function\nof various chess concepts, handcrafted by experts, tested and tuned using fishtest.\nThe NNUE evaluation computes this value with a neural network based on basic\ninputs (e.g. piece positions only). The network is optimized and trained\non the evaluations of millions of positions at moderate search depth.\n\nThe NNUE evaluation was first introduced in shogi, and ported to Stockfish afterward.\nIt can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs, and exploits the fact that only parts\nof the neural network need to be updated after a typical chess move.\n[The nodchip repository](https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish) provides additional\ntools to train and develop the NNUE networks. On CPUs supporting modern vector instructions\n(avx2 and similar), the NNUE evaluation results in much stronger playing strength, even\nif the nodes per second computed by the engine is somewhat lower (roughly 80% of nps\nis typical).\n\nNotes:\n\n1) the NNUE evaluation depends on the Stockfish binary and the network parameter\nfile (see the EvalFile UCI option). Not every parameter file is compatible with a given\nStockfish binary, but the default value of the EvalFile UCI option is the name of a network\nthat is guaranteed to be compatible with that binary.\n\n2) to use the NNUE evaluation, the additional data file with neural network parameters\nneeds to be available. Normally, this file is already embedded in the binary or it\ncan be downloaded. The filename for the default (recommended) net can be found as the default\nvalue of the `EvalFile` UCI option, with the format `nn-[SHA256 first 12 digits].nnue`\n(for instance, `nn-c157e0a5755b.nnue`). This file can be downloaded from\n```\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/api/nn/[filename]\n```\nreplacing `[filename]` as needed.\n\n## What to expect from the Syzygy tablebases?\n\nIf the engine is searching a position that is not in the tablebases (e.g.\na position with 8 pieces), it will access the tablebases during the search.\nIf the engine reports a very large score (typically 153.xx), this means\nit has found a winning line into a tablebase position.\n\nIf the engine is given a position to search that is in the tablebases, it\nwill use the tablebases at the beginning of the search to preselect all\ngood moves, i.e. all moves that preserve the win or preserve the draw while\ntaking into account the 50-move rule.\nIt will then perform a search only on those moves. **The engine will not move\nimmediately**, unless there is only a single good move. **The engine likely\nwill not report a mate score, even if the position is known to be won.**\n\nIt is therefore clear that this behaviour is not identical to what one might\nbe used to with Nalimov tablebases. There are technical reasons for this\ndifference, the main technical reason being that Nalimov tablebases use the\nDTM metric (distance-to-mate), while the Syzygy tablebases use a variation of the\nDTZ metric (distance-to-zero, zero meaning any move that resets the 50-move\ncounter). This special metric is one of the reasons that the Syzygy tablebases are\nmore compact than Nalimov tablebases, while still storing all information\nneeded for optimal play and in addition being able to take into account\nthe 50-move rule.\n\n## Large Pages\n\nStockfish supports large pages on Linux and Windows. Large pages make\nthe hash access more efficient, improving the engine speed, especially\non large hash sizes. Typical increases are 5..10% in terms of nodes per\nsecond, but speed increases up to 30% have been measured. The support is\nautomatic. Stockfish attempts to use large pages when available and\nwill fall back to regular memory allocation when this is not the case.\n\n### Support on Linux\n\nLarge page support on Linux is obtained by the Linux kernel\ntransparent huge pages functionality. Typically, transparent huge pages\nare already enabled, and no configuration is needed.\n\n### Support on Windows\n\nThe use of large pages requires \"Lock Pages in Memory\" privilege. See\n[Enable the Lock Pages in Memory Option (Windows)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows)\non how to enable this privilege, then run [RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap)\nto double-check that large pages are used. We suggest that you reboot\nyour computer after you have enabled large pages, because long Windows\nsessions suffer from memory fragmentation, which may prevent Stockfish\nfrom getting large pages: a fresh session is better in this regard.\n\n## Compiling Stockfish yourself from the sources\n\nStockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware\ninstructions, big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.\n\nOn Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish\ndirectly from the source code with the included Makefile in the folder\n`src`. In general it is recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make\ntargets with corresponding descriptions.\n\n```\n    cd src\n    make help\n    make net\n    make build ARCH=x86-64-modern\n```\n\nWhen not using the Makefile to compile (for instance, with Microsoft MSVC) you\nneed to manually set/unset some switches in the compiler command line; see\nfile *types.h* for a quick reference.\n\nWhen reporting an issue or a bug, please tell us which Stockfish version\nand which compiler you used to create your executable. This information\ncan be found by typing the following command in a console:\n\n```\n    ./stockfish compiler\n```\n\n## Understanding the code base and participating in the project\n\nStockfish's improvement over the last decade has been a great community\neffort. There are a few ways to help contribute to its growth.\n\n### Donating hardware\n\nImproving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate\nyour hardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker](https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Running-the-worker:-overview)\nand view the current tests on [Fishtest](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests).\n\n### Improving the code\n\nIf you want to help improve the code, there are several valuable resources:\n\n* [In this wiki,](https://www.chessprogramming.org) many techniques used in\nStockfish are explained with a lot of background information.\n\n* [The section on Stockfish](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish)\ndescribes many features and techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is\ngeneric rather than being focused on Stockfish's precise implementation.\nNevertheless, a helpful resource.\n\n* The latest source can always be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).\nDiscussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the [FishCooking](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fishcooking)\ngroup and on the [Stockfish Discord channel](https://discord.gg/nv8gDtt).\nThe engine testing is done on [Fishtest](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests).\nIf you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline](https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Creating-my-first-test)\nfirst, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.\n\n\n## Terms of use\n\nStockfish is free, and distributed under the **GNU General Public License version 3**\n(GPL v3). Essentially, this means you are free to do almost exactly\nwhat you want with the program, including distributing it among your\nfriends, making it available for download from your website, selling\nit (either by itself or as part of some bigger software package), or\nusing it as the starting point for a software project of your own.\n\nThe only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in\nsome way, you MUST always include the full source code, or a pointer\nto where the source code can be found, to generate the exact binary\nyou are distributing. If you make any changes to the source code,\nthese changes must also be made available under the GPL.\n\nFor full details, read the copy of the GPL v3 found in the file named\n[*Copying.txt*](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/Copying.txt).\n",
