He already is smart enough.\n```\n\nBut you can choose your own name to mock.\nLet's say, \"Chuck Norris\" (the actual original name used in the source database).\n\n```pydocstring\n>>> from laugh import NamedJokes\n>>> joke_gen = NamedJokes('Chuck Norris')  # make a joke with any name\n>>> joke_gen()\n'Chuck Norris is, and has always been where it's at.''\n>>> joke_gen(search_term='airplane')  # you can specify a (single) word to filter the random joke\n'Chuck Norris invented airplanes because he was tired of being the only person that could fly.'\n```\n\nYou can specify a (single) word to filter the random joke.\n\n```pydocstring\n>>> joke_gen(search_term='airplane') \n```\n\n```\nMacGyver can build an airplane out of gum and paper clips. Chuck Norris can kill him and take it.\n\nMacGyver can build an airplane out of gum and paper clips, but Chuck Norris can roundhouse-kick his head through a wall and take it.\n\n911 happened when Chuck Norris threw a paper airplane\n\nChuck Norris never uses parachutes when he skydives out of airplanes because they only slow him down.\n\nBefore the Wright brothers made the first airplane, Chuck Norris had already invented the rocket and flown to Pluto, where he lived for 20 years.........naked\n\nChuck Norris invented airplanes because he was tired of being the only person that could fly.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001- The World Paper Airplane Throwing Championships were held in California...Chuck Norris won when his 4 best throws landed somewhere on the East Coast.\n\nChuck Norris can fly on an airplane to Maine from Hawaii in 30 seconds. he just has to tell the pilot to move over...\n\nChuck Norris doesn't use an airplane for travel, he simply turns of the gravity and farts\n\nChuck Norris dosent use airplanes to get to other countries, he just jumps from one continent to another.\n```\n\n\n\n",
