This way of changelog management is conflict free, what is extremely\nhelpful for PR/MR driven workflow.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- Python 2.7, 3.5+;\n- setuptools (31+, but the latest release is better);\n- Your project follows `Semantic Versioning`_ or uses it simplified (``X.Y``\n  version) form;\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n0. Add `setuptools-changelog` as development dependency to your project;\n1. Create `changelog.d` directory in your project root directory\n   (where `setup.py` is located)\n2. Create there fragments files according the changes you made. Fragments files\n   have the following format::\n\n    {name}.{type}.{ext}\n\n   Where:\n\n   - ``name``: fragment name. If it *starts* with a number and you have\n     issue tracker specified, this number will turn into issue reference\n     automatically. Otherwise there could be just some mnemonic name to\n     simplify navigation.\n\n   - ``type``: fragment type. By default, the following types are available\n\n     - Major changes:\n\n       - ``epic``: Massive epic change that completely changes underlying\n         project platform. This could be a shift to completely new base\n         library, framework, etc. Epic changes are very rare and are the reason\n         for major release.\n\n       - ``breaking``: Breaking change means changes in the project\n         **public API** which makes old code incompatible with them.\n         Incompatibility means that things were removed or their behavior had\n         changed.\n\n     - Minor changes:\n\n       - ``security``: This is an important security fix. Users must update\n         ASAP. If security fix causes breaking change, two separate changelog\n         fragments should be issued.\n\n       - ``deprecation``: Deprecations are friendly warnings about upcoming\n         breaking changes in the public API.\n\n       - ``feature``: New features brings something to project and they must be\n         available for users via public API.\n\n     - Patch changes:\n\n       - ``bug``: When something works in the way it's not expected or supposed\n         to we do a bug fix.\n\n       - ``improvement``: This could be speed optimizations, internals\n         refactoring, making code more stable etc. Improvements are never\n         changes the existed behaviour or public API.\n\n       - ``build``: Changes, related to project build routines, packaging,\n         etc.\n\n       - ``doc``: Documentation updates, clarifications, typo fixes, etc.\n\n       - ``test``: Work around project testing, test suite, CI, etc.\n\n       - ``misc``: Misc changes which doesn't suites any existed category.\n         For instance, they could be announcements about project life: new\n         committers, endorsements, etc.\n\n   - ``ext``: file extension. Currently, we support only `rst` one.\n\n3. You can always preview changelog via::\n\n      python setup.py changelog\n\n4. Once you'll be ready for release, you can update your changelog file like::\n\n      python setup.py changelog --update=CHANGELOG.rst\n\n   This command will *prepend* generated changelog to your file.\n\n5. Review your changelog file content and everything is fine commit it and\n   remove fragments::\n\n      git rm changelog.d/*\n      git commit CHANGELOG.rst changelog.d/\n\nExample configuration for ``setup.cfg`` using defaults:\n\n.. code::\n\n    [changelog]\n    changelog_fragments_path = changelog.d\n    major_changes_types =\n        epic = Epic Changes\n        breaking = Breaking Changes\n        removal = Breaking Changes\n    minor_changes_types =\n        security = Security Fixes\n        deprecation = Deprecations\n        feature = New Features\n    patch_changes_types =\n        bug = Bug Fixes\n        bugfix = Bug Fixes\n        improvement = Improvements\n        build = Build\n        doc = Documentation\n        test = Tests Suite\n        misc = Miscellaneous\n\n\nAutomatic version generation\n----------------------------\n\nIf your project follows `Semantic Versioning`_ strategy, you can achieve not\njust changelog generation, but also automatic version management depending on\nchanges it has.\n\n\nIntegration with `towncrier`_\n-----------------------------\n\nThis project was started because there are several reasons for me to not use\n`towncrier`_ for changelog management. But\n\n.. epigraph::\n\n   Why have enemies, when you can have?\n\n   -- King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\n\nInstead, we can support fragments, made for towncrier with the following\nconfig:\n\n.. code::\n\n    [changelog]\n    changelog_fragments_path = changelog.d\n    major_changes_types =\n        removal = Breaking Changes\n    minor_changes_types =\n        feature = New Features\n    patch_changes_types =\n        bugfix = Bug Fixes\n        doc = Documentation\n        misc = Miscellaneous\n    use_towncrier = true\n\nAnd that's it!\n\n\n.. _Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/\n.. _towncrier: https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier\n",
