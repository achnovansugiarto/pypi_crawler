    "description": "A python library to make setting up a multiplayer game more straightforward. The low level bits on the wire are totally abstracted. Higher level options for game state, syncing, client prediction, lag compensation techniques are available but customizable for different projects. My goal for the project is to easily adapt several of my non-networked games to have a multiplayer component with a minimum of special case work on each one.\r\n\r\nUses either Chris McCormick's PodSixNet or Geometrian's Mastermind networking library for the low level bits. (Both included with the source). Currently built and optimized for the TCP protocol. UDP is a big maybe for later!\r\n\r\nCurrent version works well with a demo that syncs the positio of multiple clients, and handles lag issues reliably.\r\n\r\nThe demo uses pygame, but the networking component is completely independant.",
