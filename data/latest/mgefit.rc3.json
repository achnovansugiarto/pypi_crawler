This routine fits MGE models with constant position angle and\ncommon center.\n\nCalling Sequence\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from mgefit.mge_fit_sectors import mge_fit_sectors\n\n    m = mge_fit_sectors(self, radius, angle, counts, eps,\n             bulge_disk=False, fignum=1, linear=False, negative=False,\n             ngauss=None, normpsf=1., outer_slope=4, plot=False, qbounds=None,\n             quiet=False, rbounds=None, scale=1., sigmapsf=0., sol=0)\n\n    total_counts, sigma, q_obs = m.sol  # assign the solution to variables\n    print(m.sol.T)  # Print a table of best-fitting MGE parameters\n\nExample programs are in the ``mgefit/examples`` directory.\nIt can be found within the main ``MgeFit`` package installation folder\ninside `site-packages <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46071447>`_.\n\nA PDF manual ``readme_mge_fit_sectors.pdf`` is contained in the main\ninstallation directory ``mgefit`` of the package inside\n`site-packages <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46071447>`_.\n\nInput Parameters\n----------------\n\nradius: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector containing the radius of the surface brightness\n    measurements, taken from the galaxy center. This is given\n    in units of PIXELS (!) of the image. When fitting multiple images\n    simultaneously this is in pixels units of the high-resolution image.\nangle: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector containing the polar angle of the surface brightness\n    measurements, measured from the galaxy major axis (in degrees).\ncounts: array_like with shape (n,)\n    Vector containing the surface brightness measurements in COUNTS/PIXEL (!) at\n    the polar coordinates specified by the vectors ``radius`` and ``angle``.\n    When fitting multiple images simultaneously this is in counts/pixels units\n    of the high-resolution image.\neps:\n    Crude estimate for the galaxy characteristic ellipticity\n    ``eps = 1 - b/a = 1 - q'``\n\nOptional Keywords\n-----------------\n\nbulge_disk:\n    Set ``bulge_disk=True`` to perform a non-parametric bulge/disk\n    decomposition using MGE. When ``bulge_disk=True`` the Gaussians\n    are divided into two sets, each with a unique axial ratio. The two\n    sets are meant to describe and model the contribution of bulge and\n    disks in spiral or lenticular galaxies, or nuclear disk in ellipticals.\n\n    When this keyword is set one should increase ``ngauss``.\n    One should also either set ``qbounds=None`` or specify four\n    elements in ``qbounds`` for the even/odd Gaussians.\nfignum:\n    Optional number to assign to the plotting window.\nlinear:\n    Set this keyword to start with the fully linear algorithm\n    and then optimize the fit with the nonlinear method\n    [see Section 3.4 of `Cappellari (2002)`_ for details].\n    Nowadays using this keyword instroduces a small speed panelty but\n    produces more robust fits and is always reccomended.\nnegative:\n    Set this keyword to allow for negative Gaussians in the fit.\n    Use this only if everything else didn't work or if there is clear\n    evidence that negative Gaussians are actually needed.\n    Negative Gaussians are needed e.g. when fitting a boxy bulge.\nngauss:\n    Maximum number of Gaussians allowed in the MGE fit.\n    Typical values are in the range 10-20 when ``linear=False``\n    (default: ``ngauss=12``) and ``20**2-40**2`` when ``linear=True``\n    (default: ``ngauss=30**2=900``).\nnormpsf: array_like with shape (q,)\n    This is optional if only a scalar is given for ``sigmapsf``, otherwise it\n    must contain the normalization of each MGE component of the PSF, whose\n    sigma is given by ``sigmapsf``. The vector needs to have the same number of\n    elements as ``sigmapsf`` and it must be normalized as ``normpsf.sum() = 1``\n    (default: ``normpsf=1``).\nouter_slope:\n    This scalar forces the surface brightness profile of\n    the MGE model to decrease at least as fast as ``R**(-outer_slope)``\n    at the largest measured radius (Default: ``outer_slope=2``).\nplot:\n    Set ``plot=True`` to plot the best-fitting MGE profiles.\nqbounds:\n    This can be either a two or a four elements vector.\n\n    If ``qbounds`` has two elements, it gives the minimum and maximum\n    axial ratio ``q`` allowed in the MGE fit.\n\n    If ``qbounds`` has four elements ``[[qMin1, qMax1], [qMin2, qMax2]]``,\n    then the first two elements give the limits on ``q`` for the even\n    Gaussians, while the last two elements give the limits on ``q`` for\n    the odd Gaussians. In this way ``qbounds`` can be used to perform\n    disk/bulges decompositions in a way similar to the ``bulge_disk`` keyword.\nquiet:\n    Set ``quiet = True`` to suppress printed output.\nrbounds:\n    Two elements vector giving the minimum and maximum ``sigma``\n    allowed in the MGE fit. This is in the same PIXELS units as ``radius``.\nscale:\n    The pixel scale in arcsec/pixels. This is *only* used for the scale on\n    the plots. It has no influence on the output. (default: 1)\nsigmapsf: array_like with shape (q,)\n    Scalar giving the ``sigma`` of the PSF, or vector with the ``sigma`` of an\n    MGE model for the circular PSF. This is in the same PIXELS units as ``radius``.\n    When fitting multiple images simultaneously this is the PSF of the\n    high-resolution image [see pg. 406 of `Cappellari (2002)`_ for details].\n    (Default: no convolution)\nsol:\n    If this keyword has at least 6 elements in input, the sigma\n    and q_obs will be used as starting point for the optimization.\n    This is useful for testing but is never needed otherwise.\n    The format is described in the Output Parameters below.\n\nOutput Parameters\n-----------------\n\nStored as attributes of the ``MgeFit`` class:\n\nsol: array_like with shape (3, ngauss)\n    Array with the best-fitting MGE solution:\n\n    * ``sol[0] = total_counts`` of the Gaussian components;\n    * ``sol[1] = sigma`` is the dispersion of the best-fitting\n      Gaussians in pixels;\n    * ``sol[2] = q_obs``, is the observed axial ratio [q' in the\n      notation of `Cappellari (2002)`_] of the best-fitting Gaussian\n      components.\n\n    The relation below gives the Gaussian peak surface brightness ``surf``::\n\n        total_counts, q_obs, sigma = m.sol  # Assign the solution to variables\n        surf = total_counts/(2*np.pi*q_obs*sigma**2)\n\nabsdev:\n    Mean absolute deviation between the fitted MGE and the\n    data expressed as a fraction. Good fits to high S/N images\n    can reach values of ``absdev < 0.02 = 2%``.\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nOther/Proprietary License\n\nCopyright (c) 1999-2021 Michele Cappellari\n\nThis software is provided as is without any warranty whatsoever.\nPermission to use, for non-commercial purposes is granted.\nPermission to modify for personal or internal use is granted,\nprovided this copyright and disclaimer are included in all \ncopies of the software.
