    "description": "# metasheet\n\nA Python library for generating metadata around statistical and scientific datasets in various formats from an Excel or Google spreadsheet. \n\nMetasheet is aimed at supporting the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) initiative and the [DDI](https://www.ddialliance.org) specification by enabling users to rapidly and easily capture codebook like documentation, or maintain classifications, variables, and other resource banks. Typical users are data librarians, SQL database administrators, and application developers. \n\nTo use the tool, metadata managers or curators only need to be familiar with Google Sheet or Excel. Running the metasheet utility to generate various outputs requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer and being able to call metasheet form the command line. No Python knowledge or programming experience are required.\n\nCurrently supported output formats include:\n\n- bq: To generate a table for hosting data in Google Big Query\n- ddi: produces DDI-XML. Only option at this time is 2.5 (3.x or DDI-CLI on roadmap)\n- pandas: code for reading data in Python Pandas dataframe\n- rds: JSON format used by MTNA Rich Data Services\n- sts: Stat/Transfer syntax that can be used with the software MTNA SledgeHammer for reading data\n- sql: Various SQL syntaxes. Currently supported options includes monetdb, mssql, mysql, postgres, vertica\n\nThe package is extendible and additional serializer can easily be created.\n\nMetasheet was initially designed by [Metadata Technology North America](https://www.mtna.us) as an internal utility to facilitate the capture of metadata for bulk loading into its platform repositories. It has been transitioned as an open source utility to help support and encourage the adoption of standards and best practices.\n\n## How it works\n\nEach sheet in the workbook is used to describe a particular type of resource.\n\nThe five fundamental resources commonly defined in a metasheet are classification, code, variable, record, layout. These are essentially the information typically found in data codebooks. The advantage of metasheet is that these resources can be defined independently and reused, as well as carry many different properties. For example a classification can be used by many variables, and variables can be used in many different records layouts (files, database tables).\n\nEach column in the sheet maps to a particular resource property. The column header row is used to determine such correspondence (the property name). The name in the sheet may be different from the actual property name, and these mappings are defined in a JSON configuration file using regular expressions. A default configuration is provided as a recommended default version, but this can be customized by advanced users. Columns for which no mapping is found are ignored.\n\nResources in the metasheet are related to each other based on a unique identifier composed of the `bank` and `id` properties:\n\n- variables can be used in layout or as basis for other variables (inheritance)\n- classifications are used by variables to associate code list / value label, or to maintain stand alone classifications)\n- codes are used by classifications\n- records represent a file or database table\n- layouts describe the variables in a record\n\nNote that documentation is sparse and under development. The information below may be incomplete or not be entirely aligned on latest features. Metasheet is best learned by looking at actual examples, some being available alongside the package source code on GitHub or in public Google sheets. \n\n## Running the tool\n\nFrom the metasheet directory, run\n\n`python metasheet.py -h`\n\n```bash\nusage: metasheet.py [-h] [-a] [-aria] [-bq] [-c CONFIG] [-cx EXTENSIONS]\n                    [-cl CLASSIFICATIONS] [-ddi DDI] [--dump DUMP]\n                    [-gsheet GSHEET] [-lang LANGUAGE] [-mock]\n                    [-mockopts MOCKAROO_OPTIONS] [-mysql]\n                    [-pandas [PANDAS [PANDAS ...]]] [-rds]\n                    [-rl RECORD_LAYOUTS] [-rml] [-rmlopts RML_OPTIONS]\n                    [-sql [SQL [SQL ...]]] [-sts] [-vertica] [-save [SAVE]]\n                    [-load [LOAD]] [-o [OUT]]\n                    [infile [infile ...]]\n```\n\nUse `-a` to generate all possible outputs.\n\nThe `-aria` and `-rml` formats are internal MTNA formats used \n\n### Using with Google Sheet\n\nTo use with a Google Sheet, you will need the spreadsheet unique identifier and make sure is shared for public access. If this is not an option, you can always manually download the Excel version of the spreadsheet to.your local machine form the File->Download\n\nThe identifier can be found in the browser URL and is a long string of characters after the \n`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheet-unique-identifer>/edit?usp=sharing`\nYou can use this value with the `-gsheet` parameter, which will download an Excel copy of the spreadsheet on your computer for processing (called metasheet.xslx by default). \n\nNote that, once downloaded, you can keep using the local Excel file directly unless you make a change to the Google version (in which case it will need to be downloaded again)\n\nUse the `Share` button in Google Sheet to set permission for \"Anyone with a link\" to be at least a \"Viewer\".\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe package is driven by a configuration file that maps the sheet names and columns into resources and properties. This usually does not need to be changed unless you use custom properties. See default [```config.json```](metasheet/config.json)metasheet/config.json] in package source.\n\nThe configuration file provides metasheet with the information it needs to process the worksheet. This includes:\n\n* ```sheetRegex```: this regular expression, specified for each resources type,  is used to match a sheet name with the particular type. For example, ```\"sheetRegex\":\"^variable.*\"``` is the defualt used to match variabel sheets.\n* ```propertyMaps```: holds information about mappin columns header names to resource properties. Property maps can be specified at the resource type or global level (in which case they apply to all resources. See below for \n\n### Property Maps\n\nA property maps matches a sheet column with a specific resource property. This is use to allow different names to be used in the sheets (rather than restricting to a list of internal names). Property maps can exist at the global or resource type level, the later taking precedence. \n\nA recource map must contain the following elements:\n\n* regex: the regular expression that the column header name is matching. \n* property: the internal property name\n\nOptional elements can be included to suport specific serializers (e.g. rml, rds, etc.)\n\nFor example:\n\n```{\"regex\":\"abbr|abbreviation\",\"property\":\"name[abbreviation]\",\"rml\":\"*\"},```\n\nmaps the ```abbr``` or ```abbreviation``` column into the property ```name[abbreviation]```\n\nNote that for faceted properties, a special \"named\" search group is introduced to determine the facet components. In Python, this takes the form ```?P<facets>``` as a group prefix. The following for example maps a ```name``` column into the into ```name``` property but would also map name[label] into ```name[label]```\n```{\"regex\":\"^name(\\\\[(?P<facets>.*)\\\\])?$\",\"property\":\"name\"}```\n\nNote that the Layout resource type also inherits all the properties of the variable type.â—Š\n\n## Resources\n\nAll resources have a ```uid``` property generated as a UUID\n\nThe following properties can be associated with any resource (not all being relevant to all resources):\n\n* ```name[abbreviation]```: the container this resource will be stored in* ```bank```: the container that \"defines / holds this resource. Every resource belongs to a bank (implicitely or explicitely).\n* ```basis```: a reference to a resource of the same type from which properties can be inherited. \n* ```clbank```: a classfication bank identifer\n* ```id```: the resource identifier (must be unique in the workbook or bank)\n* ```name```: the resource name\n\nIn most cases, the ```id``` and ```name``` are the same so specifying only one of them is typically sufficient.\n\nAdditional serializer specific map properties can also be used. For example:\n\n* ```rml```: If present, indicates that this property should be set on RML resources. A \"*\" indicates that the RML property has the same name. \n* ```rds```: If present, indicates that this property should be set on RDS resources. A \"*\" indicates that the RML property has the same name. \n\n### References\n\nA reference to another resource must be unique within the worksheet to ensure proper resolution (). References can be specified in various ways, usually using two properties representing a ```bank``` and an ```id```, or using the dot notation like ```bank.id```.\n\n### Inheritance\n\nThe ```basis``` property on a resource is a reference to another resource of the same type whose properties are inherited if not locally specified.\n\n### Facets\n\nCertain properties can be faceted, this includes ```name```, ```description```, ```dataType```, and more. \n\n\n## Classifications\n\nA classification is composed of the classification definition and its code list. These are captured in two seperate sheets.\n\n### Classification\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Classification:\n\n* n/a\n\n### Code\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Code:\n\n* ```classification```: the classification the code belongs to\n* ```value```: The code value \n\n## Variables\n\nVariable must have at least a ```name```, a ```bank```, and typically a datatype.\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Variable:\n\n* ```classification```: a reference to the classification used by this variable\n* ```datatype```: a generic or faceted data type \n* ```decimals```: for numeric variables, the number of digits after the decimal point (0 implies integer)\n* ```end```: the end column position when used in a record layout serialized in fixed ASCII\n* ```profile```: ?\n* ```start```: the start column position when used in a record layout serialized in fixed ASCII\n* ```units```: a list generic or faceted units relevant for this variable (observation, analysis)\n* ```width```: the total width of the variable content (e.g. for storing data in a fixed width ASCII file)\n\n## Record Layout\n\nA record layout has two components/sheets: Record and Layout\n\n### Record\n\nCapture properties for entire record layout \n\nRequired elements are: ```bank```, ```id```, ```name```\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Record:\n\n* ```varbank```: a default variable bank id that applies to all variables in the layout\n* ```unit```: one or more record unit types (semi-colon separated)\n* ```pk|primary```: one or more variables defining the record primary key. Compound keys variables are separate with a \"+\".\n* ```fk|foreign```: one or more sets of variable(s) defining the record foreigns keys. Compound keys variables are separate with a \"+\", and multiple keys are separated by a \";\".\n\n### Layout\n\nA Layout associates variables with a record \n\nVariables can be either locally created or included by reference (if no additional properties are required for the record layout). This is determined by the presence of certain properties. If no other properties than the record and variable are specified, the variable in included by references. Otherwise it is locally defined. A layout can technically also mix both and override base property values (e.g. change name, label, description, type).\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Layout:\n\n* ```variable```: the base variable identifier\n* ```varbank```: the variable bank holding the referenced variable. This can override the record level varbank.\n* ```rlbank```: the bank holding the record \n* ```record```: the record identifier\n\nIn addition, all the properties supported by the Variable resource can also be used (e.g. to locally define a variable)\n\nFor a Layout, the basis property (if not set) is automatically inferred from the variable and varbank properties.\n\n## Rules\n\nRules are used by the MTNA Atua framework quality assurance and ETL components, and mainly used at this time by our Resource Modelling Language (RML) serializer. This is an experimental feature.\n\nThe following properties are specific to the Layout:\n\n* ```resource```: the resource the rule applies to (may be supplemented by a bank properity)\n* ```assert```: the expression statement to test\n* ```condition```: the condition under which the rule applies\n* ```onFail```: the action to take when the rule assertion fails\n* ```onSuccess```: the action to take when the rule assertion succeeds\n* ```contextVariables```: a comma separate list of variables whose values will be reported with the onPass/onFail messages\n\nNote that rules do not require a unique identifier at this time. \n",
