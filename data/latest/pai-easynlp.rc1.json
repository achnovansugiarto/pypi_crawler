It is built with scalable distributed training strategies and supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms for various NLP applications. EasyNLP integrates knowledge distillation and few-shot learning for landing large pre-trained models and provides a unified framework of model training, inference, and deployment for real-world applications. It has powered more than 10 BUs and more than 20 business scenarios within the Alibaba group. It is seamlessly integrated to [Platform of AI (PAI)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bigdata/product/learn) products, including PAI-DSW for development, PAI-DLC for cloud-native training, PAI-EAS for serving, and PAI-Designer for zero-code model training.\n\n# Main Features\n\n- **Easy to use and highly customizable:** In addition to providing easy-to-use and concise commands to call cutting-edge models, it also abstracts certain custom modules such as AppZoo and ModelZoo to make it easy to build NLP applications. It is equipped with the PAI PyTorch distributed training framework TorchAccelerator to speed up distributed training.\n- **Compatible with open-source libraries:** EasyNLP has APIs to support the training of models from Huggingface/Transformers with the PAI distributed framework. It also supports the pre-trained models in [EasyTransfer](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyTransfer) ModelZoo.\n- **Knowledge-injected pre-training:** The PAI team has a lot of research on knowledge-injected pre-training, and builds a knowledge-injected model that wins first place in the CCF knowledge pre-training competition. EasyNLP integrates these cutting-edge knowledge pre-trained models, including DKPLM and KGBERT.\n- **Landing large pre-trained models:** EasyNLP provides few-shot learning capabilities, allowing users to finetune large models with only a few samples to achieve good results. At the same time, it provides knowledge distillation functions to help quickly distill large models to a small and efficient model to facilitate online deployment.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can either install it from pip\n\n```bash\n$ pip install pai-easynlp (to be released)\n```\n\nor setup from the source：\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP.git\n$ cd EasyNLP\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\nThis repo is tested on Python3.6, PyTorch >= 1.8.\n\n# Quick Start\n\nNow let's show how to use just a few lines of code to build a text classification model based on BERT.\n\n```python\nfrom easynlp.core import Trainer\nfrom easynlp.appzoo import ClassificationDataset, SequenceClassification\nfrom easynlp.utils import initialize_easynlp\n\nargs = initialize_easynlp()\n\ntrain_dataset = ClassificationDataset(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.pretrained_model_name_or_path,\n    data_file=args.tables,\n    max_seq_length=args.sequence_length,\n    input_schema=args.input_schema,\n    first_sequence=args.first_sequence,\n    label_name=args.label_name,\n    label_enumerate_values=args.label_enumerate_values,\n    is_training=True)\n\nmodel = SequenceClassification(pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.pretrained_model_name_or_path)\nTrainer(model=model,  train_dataset=train_dataset).train()\n```\n\nThen you can run the code:\n\n```bash\npython main.py \\\n  --mode train \\\n  --tables=train_toy.tsv \\\n  --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \\\n  --first_sequence=sent1 \\\n  --label_name=label \\\n  --label_enumerate_values=0,1 \\\n  --checkpoint_dir=./tmp/ \\\n  --epoch_num=1  \\\n  --app_name=text_classify \\\n  --user_defined_parameters='pretrain_model_name_or_path=bert-tiny-uncased'\n```\n\nYou can also use AppZoo Command Line Tools to quickly train an App model. Take text classification on SST-2 dataset as an example. First you can download the [train.tsv](http://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/classification/train.tsv), and [dev.tsv](http://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/classification/dev.tsv), then start training:\n\n```bash\n$ easynlp \\\n   --mode=train \\\n   --worker_gpu=1 \\\n   --tables=train.tsv,dev.tsv \\\n   --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \\\n   --first_sequence=sent1 \\\n   --label_name=label \\\n   --label_enumerate_values=0,1 \\\n   --checkpoint_dir=./classification_model \\\n   --epoch_num=1  \\\n   --sequence_length=128 \\\n   --app_name=text_classify \\\n   --user_defined_parameters='pretrain_model_name_or_path=bert-small-uncased'\n```\n\nAnd then predict:\n\n```bash\n$ easynlp \\\n  --mode=predict \\\n  --tables=dev.tsv \\\n  --outputs=dev.pred.tsv \\\n  --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \\\n  --output_schema=predictions,probabilities,logits,output \\\n  --append_cols=label \\\n  --first_sequence=sent1 \\\n  --checkpoint_path=./classification_model \\\n  --app_name=text_classify\n```\n\nTo learn more about the usage of AppZoo, please refer to our [documentation](https://www.yuque.com/easyx/easynlp/kkhkai).\n\n# ModelZoo\nEasyNLP currently provides the following models in ModelZoo:\n\n1.
