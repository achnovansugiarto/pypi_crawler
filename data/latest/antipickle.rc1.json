Because pickle isn't the right way to persist or share data, and [we all know that](#when-to-not-use-pickle).\n\nWhen it comes to practice, it takes time and effort to substitute pickle. <br />\n'Hmm, I can use json here' &mdash; I thought on many occasions, and usually was wrong.\n\nSomething small but annoying was in the way: <br />\n`datetime` that can't be stored or `np.array` that serializers don't know how to deal with. \nOr even `bytes`! And many smaller things. \n\nAt this point I either had to give up and pickle it <br />\nOR allocate time on figuring out 'how do I make this right'. \n\n`antipickle` solves this for me.\n\n\n`antipickle` is a **restricted** format for **safe, persistent, and platform-independent** storage. \n\nAlso, it is very convenient:\n```python\nimport antipickle\nantipickle.dump(data, 'data.antipickle')\nantipickle.dump(data, 's3://mybucket/data.antipickle')     # stores in s3 \nantipickle.dump(data, 's3://mybucket/data.antipickle.gz')  # will additionally gzip\n\n\nloaded_date = antipickle.load('s3://mybucket/data.antipickle.gz') # or local file\n```\n\n\n<!---\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Comparison](#Comparison)\n\n--->\n\n\nTo download/upload from s3 you need an additional dependency: `pip install s3fs`.\n\n\n## Batteries included:\n\n\nHere is a simple example of what antipickle can save/load:\n\n```python\ndata = {\n    'constants': [3.1415, 2.718, True, False, 42],\n    'with nones': [1, None, 0],\n    b'bytes': b\"can be stored too!\",\n    'nested lists and tuples': [[1, [2]], (1, 2, None), {'nested': 'dict'}],\n    ('tuple', 'as', 'key'): {'is_ok': True},\n    'numpy nd': np.zeros([3, 4], dtype='uint32'),\n}\nantipickle.dump(data, 'data.antipickle')\n```\n\nMore formally, `antipickle` supports python pieces commonly used for computations:\n\n- `bytes`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`, and `None`\n- `list`, `tuple`, `set` (all of them are stored as different entities)\n- `dict` (including integer keys and `tuple` keys)\n- `numpy` arrays (native `.npy` format used; `dtype=O` not supported)\n- `pandas` series and dataframe (using parquet serialization via `pyarrow`)\n- `polars` series and dataframe (using parquet)\n- Any tree-formed structure of the above (no loops allowed)\n\nConfigurable support: `dataclasses` and `pydantic` classes.\n\n\nFor reference, other non-pythonic formats (json and its binary relatives) have problems with native types\n(not making difference between list and tuple) or encodings (not storing bytes)\nor collections (not allowing integers, bytes and tuples in dict keys). <br />\nAntipickle is python-centric and has it solved.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```console\npip install antipickle\n```\n\n## What is it for\n\nLet's set the expectation bar. **antipickle is**\n\n- not fast, but isn't slow either\n- not super-compact, but quite ok\n- restricted: it wasn't designed to serialize just anything, \n  it focuses on common python types and cases for data folks\n\n\nAt the same time, **antipickle is** \n\n- safe\n- persistent\n- very convenient\n- modular and easy to extend \n\nand thus suitable for data sharing and data preservation.\n\n\n## When to (not) use `pickle`\n\n`pickle` is designed for interprocess communication or as a temporary storage. \n`pickle` has a good tradeoff of space- and time- efficiency and can serialize almost anything, including graphs with cycles.\n\nName `pickle` suggests you could use it for long-term preservation of data, but that's not true:\n`pickle`'s serialization is tied to an internal object representation, which is not guaranteed \nto be preserved in the next release (or even on a different OS).\nDevelopers of some packages (notably `scikit-learn`) provide some guarantees about being able to parse models \nthat were saved with previous 1-2 minor package releases, but that's an exception not a rule.\n\nSecond, `pickle` is insecure. And unreadable. And pickles can be large. \nDuring unpickling they can do anything python can, i.e. anything at all.\nSo python docs [say it clear](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html): `Only unpickle data you trust!`.\n\nThat said, `pickle` is extremely convenient and simple to use, and works as a short-term solution for many cases, \nso we all (python data folks) kinda doing that wrong pickling thing from time to time, because of convenience.\nAnd because very few of us are ready to spend time on figuring out proper serialization.\n\nAll comments above apply to `pickle`-like libs like `joblib`, `dill`, `cloudpickle`.\n\n## License\n\n`antipickle` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.\n\n## Other\n\n`antipickle` builds upon `msgpack-python` (the only dependency).\n\n`antipickle` supports all maintained python versions (Python 3.7+)\n\n",
