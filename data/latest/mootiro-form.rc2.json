    "description": "Mootiro Form\n============\n\nMootiro Form is a web application for web form creation, collection of entries and report generation.\n\nMootiro is an effort by [IT3S](www.it3s.org) to build web tools for\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nThe license is BSD. See the file LICENSE.txt\n\nTechnical Instructions\n======================\n\nMootiro Form is a web app built on top of Python, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy, Genshi, JQuery and other libraries.\n\nInstallation follows pretty much the same instructions as any Pyramid web app.\n\nSpecific settings are covered in the INSTALL.txt file.\n\nInstallation instructions\n=========================\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n### Operating System ###\n\nMootiro Form should run fine on Linux (recommended), Unix and Mac OS.\n\nAll development has been done under Linux, but deploying on Windows\nshould work if the required libraries are available.\n\n### Python ###\n\nPython 2.7 or higher is required. __Python 3 is not supported yet.__\n\nWe recommend using virtualenv for installing the necessary libraries. On\nUbuntu Natty, you can install them with `sudo apt-get install python-setuptools`\n\n### Database ###\n\n*  PostgreSQL 8 or 9 (recommended)\n    *  Make sure to install the psycopg2 library. On Ubuntu Natty, you can install it with `sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2`\n*  SQLite 3\n\n### HTTP Server ###\n\nWe recommend using Apache with mod\\_wsgi, but theoretically, any server supporting [WSGI](http://wsgi.org) interface should do fine.\n\nApache can be installed on Ubuntu Natty with `sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi`\n\n\n0.0\n---\n\n-  Initial version",
