Enables download and execution\nof docker containers by non-privileged users in Linux systems where\ndocker is not available. It can be used to pull and execute docker\ncontainers in Linux batch systems and interactive clusters that are\nmanaged by other entities such as grid infrastructures or externally\nmanaged batch or interactive systems.\n\nudocker does not require any type of privileges nor the deployment of\nservices by system administrators. It can be downloaded and executed\nentirely by the end user.\n\nudocker is a wrapper around several tools to mimic a subset of the\ndocker capabilities including pulling images and running containers\nwith minimal functionality.\n\n## How does it work\nudocker is a simple tool written in Python, it has a minimal set\nof dependencies so that can be executed in a wide range of Linux\nsystems.\n\nudocker does not make use of docker nor requires its presence.\n\nudocker \"executes\" the containers by simply providing a chroot like\nenvironment over the extracted container. The current implementation\nsupports different methods to mimic chroot enabling execution of\ncontainers without requiring privileges under a chroot like environment.\nudocker transparently supports several methods to execute the containers\nusing tools and libraries such as:\n\n* PRoot\n* Fakechroot\n* runC\n* Singularity\n\n## Advantages\n* Provides a docker like command line interface\n* Supports a subset of docker commands:\n  search, pull, import, export, load, create and run\n* Understands docker container metadata\n* Can be deployed by the end-user\n* Does not require privileges for installation\n* Does not require privileges for execution\n* Does not require compilation, just transfer the Python script and run\n* Encapsulates several execution methods\n* Includes the required tools already compiled to work across systems\n* Tested with GPGPU and MPI applications\n* Runs both on new and older Linux distributions including:\n  CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 14, Ubuntu 16, Ubunto 18, Fedora, etc\n\n## Installation\nSee the [Installation manual](doc/installation_manual.md)\n\n## Syntax\n```\nCommands:\n  search <repo/image:tag>       :Search dockerhub for container images\n  pull <repo/image:tag>         :Pull container image from dockerhub\n  images                        :List container images\n  create <repo/image:tag>       :Create container from a pulled image\n  ps                            :List created containers\n  rm  <container>               :Delete container\n  run <container>               :Execute container\n  inspect <container>           :Low level information on container\n  name <container_id> <name>    :Give name to container\n  rmname <name>                 :Delete name from container\n\n  rmi <repo/image:tag>          :Delete image\n  rm <container-id>             :Delete container\n  import <tar> <repo/image:tag> :Import tar file (exported by docker)\n  import - <repo/image:tag>     :Import from stdin (exported by docker)\n  load -i <exported-image>      :Load image from file (saved by docker)\n  load                          :Load image from stdin (saved by docker)\n  export -o <tar> <container>   :Export container rootfs to file\n  export - <container>          :Export container rootfs to stdin\n  inspect <repo/image:tag>      :Return low level information on image\n  verify <repo/image:tag>       :Verify a pulled image\n  clone <container>             :duplicate container\n\n  protect <repo/image:tag>      :Protect repository\n  unprotect <repo/image:tag>    :Unprotect repository\n  protect <container>           :Protect container\n  unprotect <container>         :Unprotect container\n\n  mkrepo <topdir>               :Create repository in another location\n  setup                         :Change container execution settings\n  login                         :Login into docker repository\n  logout                        :Logout from docker repository\n\n  help                          :This help\n  run --help                    :Command specific help\n\n\nOptions common to all commands must appear before the command:\n  -D                          :Debug\n  --repo=<directory>          :Use repository at directory\n```\n\n## Examples\nSome examples of usage:\n\nSearch container images in dockerhub.\n```\nudocker search  fedora\nudocker search  ubuntu\nudocker search  indigodatacloud\n```\n\nPull from dockerhub and list the pulled images.\n```\nudocker pull  fedora:25\nudocker pull  busybox\nudocker pull  iscampos/openqcd\nudocker images\n```\n\nPull from a registry other than dockerhub.\n```\nudocker pull --registry=https://registry.access.redhat.com  rhel7\nudocker create --name=rh7 rhel7\nudocker run rh7\n```\n\nCreate the container from a pulled image and run it.\n```\nudocker create --name=myfed  fedora:25\nudocker run  myfed  cat /etc/redhat-release\n```\n\nRun mounting the host /home/u457 into the container directory /home/cuser.\nNotice that you can \"mount\" any host directory inside the container, this\nis not a real mount but the directories will be visible inside the container.\n```\nudocker run -v /home/u457:/home/cuser -w /home/user myfed  /bin/bash\nudocker run -v /var -v /proc -v /sys -v /tmp  myfed  /bin/bash\n```\n\nPut a script in your host /tmp and execute it in the container.\n```\nudocker run  -v /tmp  myfed  /bin/bash -c 'cd /tmp; ./myscript.sh'\n```\n\nRun mounting the host /var, /proc, /sys and /tmp in the same container\ndirectories. Notice that the content of these container directories will\nbe obfuscated.\n```\nudocker run -v /var -v /proc -v /sys -v /tmp  myfed  /bin/bash\n```\n\nInstall software inside the container.\n```\nudocker run  --user=root myfed  yum install -y firefox pulseaudio gnash-plugin\n```\n\nRun as some user. The usernames should exist in the container.\n```\nudocker run --user 1000:1001  myfed  /bin/id\nudocker run --user root   myfed  /bin/id\nudocker run --user jorge  myfed  /bin/id\n```\n\nRunning Firefox.\n```\n./udocker run --bindhome --hostauth --hostenv \\\n   -v /sys -v /proc -v /var/run -v /dev --user=jorge --dri myfed  firefox\n```\n\nChange execution engine mode from PRoot to Fakechroot and run.\n```\n./udocker setup  --execmode=F4  myfed\n\n./udocker run --bindhome --hostauth --hostenv \\\n   -v /sys -v /proc -v /var/run -v /dev --user=jorge --dri myfed  firefox\n```\n\nChange execution engine mode to accelerated PRoot.\n```\n./udocker setup  --execmode=P1  myfed\n```\n\nChange execution engine to runC.\n```\n./udocker setup  --execmode=R1  myfed\n```\n\nChange execution engine to Singularity. Requires the availability of\nSingularity in the host system.\n```\n./udocker setup  --execmode=S1  myfed\n```\n\n## Limitations\nSince root privileges are not involved any operation that really\nrequires such privileges will not be possible. The following  are\nexamples of operations that are not possible:\n\n* accessing host protected devices and files\n* listening on TCP/IP privileged ports (range below 1024)\n* mount file-systems\n* the su command will not work\n* change the system time\n* changing routing tables, firewall rules, or network interfaces\n\nIf the containers require such capabilities then docker should be used\ninstead.\n\nThe current implementation is limited to the pulling of docker images\nand its execution. The actual containers should be built using docker\nand dockerfiles.\n\nudocker does not provide all the docker features, and is not intended\nas a docker replacement.\n\nDebugging inside of udocker with the PRoot engine will not work due to\nthe way PRoot implements the chroot environment\n\nudocker is mainly oriented at providing a run-time environment for\ncontainers execution in user space.\n\nudocker is particularly suited to run user applications encapsulated\nin docker containers.\n\n## Security\nBecause of the limitations described in the previous section udocker does\nnot offer isolation features such as the ones offered by docker. If the\ncontainers content is not trusted then these containers should not be\nexecuted with udocker as they will run inside the user environment.\n\nThe containers data will be unpacked and stored in the user home directory or\nother location of choice. Therefore the containers data will be subjected to\nthe same filesystem protections as other files owned by the user. If the\ncontainers have sensitive information the files and directories should be\nadequately protected by the user.\n\nudocker does not require privileges and runs under the identity of the user\ninvoking it.\n\nUsers can downloaded udocker and execute it without requiring system\nadministrators intervention.\n\nudocker via PRoot offers the emulation of the root user. This emulation\nmimics a real root user (e.g getuid will return 0). This is just an emulation\nno root privileges are involved. This feature makes possible the execution\nof some tools that do not require actual privileges but which refuse to\nwork if the username or id are not root or 0. This enables for instance\nsoftware installation using rpm, yum or dnf inside the container.\n\nDue to the lack of isolation udocker must not be run by privileged users.\n\n## Other limitations\nNotice that when using execution engines other than PRoot (Pn modes) the\ncreated containers cannot be moved across hosts. In this case convert back\nto a Pn mode before transfer.\n\nThe accelerated mode of PRoot (mode P1) may exhibit failures in Linux kernels\nabove 4.0 with some applications due to kernel changes and upstream issues in\nthis case use mode P2 or any of the other modes.\n\nThe runC mode requires a recent kernel with user namespaces enabled.\n\nThe singularity mode requires the availability of Singularity in the host\nsystem.\n\n## Documentation\nThe full documentation is available at:\n\n* GitBook: https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/udocker/content/\n* master: https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/SUMMARY.md\n* devel: https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/devel/SUMMARY.md\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee: [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Citing\nWhen citing udocker please use the following:\n\n* Jorge Gomes, Emanuele Bagnaschi, Isabel Campos, Mario David, Luís Alves, João Martins, João Pina, Alvaro López-García, Pablo Orviz, Enabling rootless Linux Containers in multi-user environments: The udocker tool, Computer Physics Communications, Available online 6 June 2018, ISSN 0010-4655, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.05.021\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Docker https://www.docker.com/\n* PRoot https://proot-me.github.io/\n* Fakechroot https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot/wiki\n* runC https://runc.io/\n* Singularity https://www.sylabs.io/\n* INDIGO DataCloud https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu\n* EOSC-hub https://eosc-hub.eu\n* DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu\n\n\n\nudocker (1.1.3)\n  * Support for nvidia drivers on ubuntu\n    -
