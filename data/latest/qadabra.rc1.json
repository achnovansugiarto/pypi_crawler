you should see two folders: `config` and `workflow`.\nIf you open the `config/config.yaml` file, you can see a number of options with which to run Qadabra.\nYou can modify these as you like.\nFor example, if you want to only run DESeq2, ANCOM-BC, and Songbird, you can delete the other entries in the `tools` heading.\n\nFrom the command line, execute `snakemake --use-conda <other options>` to start the workflow.\nPlease read the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html) for how to run Snakemake best on your system.\n\nWhen this process is completed, you should have directories `figures`, `results`, and `log`.\nEach of these directories will have a separate folder for each dataset you added.\n\n### Generating a report\n\nYou can also generate a report of the workflow with the following command:\n\n```\nsnakemake --report report.zip\n```\n\nThis will create a zipped directory containing the report.\nUnzip this file and open the `report.html` file to view the report in your browser.\n\n## Additional workflow options\n\n### Worfklow subset\n\nIn some cases you may not want to run the full workflow and may only be interested in just running the different tools.\nYou can use `snakemake all_differentials --use-conda <other options>` to eschew the machine learning and visualization parts of the workflow.\n\n### Phylogenetic visualization\n\nQadabra allows users to visualize the differentials on a phylogenetic tree using [EMPress](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mSystems.01216-20).\nWith EMPress, you can annotate the tree with the differentials as barplots.\nThis can be useful for determining phylogenetic signal in differential abundance.\n\n### Incorporating confounders\n\nYou can also specify additional confounders to incorporate into your DA model.\nWhen adding a dataset, use `--confounder <column name>` to add a confounder into your model.\nYou can add multiple confounders by adding more `--confounder <column name>` arguments to `add-dataset`.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nQadabra runs several differential abundance tools on the same dataset.\nThe features are ranked according to their association with the given metadata covariate.\nThe top and bottom features are then used to create log-ratios according to [Morton 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10656-5) and [Fedarko 2020](https://github.com/biocore/qurro).\nThese log-ratios are used as predictors in logistic regression models to predict the class given the log-ratio.\n\n### Output\n\nQadabra generates many results files including many intermediate files that can be explored further.\n\n#### Results\n\nEach tool's output is stored in a separate subdirectory.\nFor the R tools, an RDS object with the tool's R data is saved.\nThe raw outputs are processed and concatenated into a file called `concatenated_differentials.tsv`.\nA Qurro visualization of all the tool ranks is generated at `results/<dataset>/qurro/index.html`.\nAn interactive table with all the tool outputs is at `results/<dataset>/differentials_table.html`.\n\nFor each tool, the ranked features are used for machine learning models.\nThe `config.yaml` file enumerates the percentile of feats to use for log-ratios.\nFor example, at the 5% percentile, the top 5% of features and the bottom 5% of features associated with `covariate` are used to compute a log-ratio for each sample.\nThis log-ratio is used in repeated K-fold cross-validation to determine how well this log-ratio can predict class membership using logistic regression.\nThe `ml` subdirectory of each tool contains the features used, sample log-ratios, and compressed model objects.\n\n#### Figures\n\nThe differential rank plots of each tool are plotted as `<tool_name>_differentials.svg`.\nA heatmap of the pairwise Kendall rank correlation among all pairs of tools is available as well.\nWe also generated interactive plots to help compare the ranks of different features from the tools.\n`figures/pca.svg` generates a PCA plot of all the features, showing the concordance and discordance of results as well as the contribution of the tools.\nYou can use the `figures/rank_comparisons.html` webpage to dynamically explore the relationship between pairs of tools.\nThe `upset` subdirectory contains [UpSet](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FTVCG.2014.2346248) plots comparing the features from each tool.\nFinally, the `roc` and `pr` subdirectories contain ROC and PR (respectively) plots of all tools at each percentile of features.\n\n\n",
