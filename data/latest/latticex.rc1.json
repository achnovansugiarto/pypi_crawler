It integrates with mainstream privacy-preserving computation technologies, including cryptography, federated learning and trusted execution environment. Rosetta aims to provide privacy-preserving solutions for artificial intelligence without requiring expertise in cryptography, federated learning and trusted execution environment. Rosetta reuses the APIs of TensorFlow and allows to transfer traditional TensorFlow codes into a privacy-preserving manner with minimal changes. E.g., just add the following line.\n\n```python\nimport latticex.rosetta\n```\n\nThe current version integrates the secure multi-party computation protocols for 3 parties. The underlying protocol is [SecureNN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/442.pdf). It is secure in the semi-honest model with honest majority.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor now, Rosetta runs on Ubuntu 18.04, and is based on TensorFlow 1.14 with CPUs (Windows OS is not currently supported yet). You can install Rosetta as follows.\n\nFirst, please check that your local system meets our base environment requirement.\n\nThen install the native TensorFlow with the following codes. Note that you could also install it from source code.\n\n```bash\n# install tensorflow\npip3 install tensorflow==1.14.0\n```\n\nAnd then build and install Rosetta with our all-in-one script as follows.\n\n```bash\n# clone rosetta git repository\ngit clone https://github.com/LatticeX-Foundation/Rosetta.git\ncd Rosetta\n# compile, install and run test cases\nbash compile_and_test_all.sh\n```\n\nBefore running your program, you should configure with your network topology so that a distributed network can be established for parties to communicate with each other.\n\nYou could use an example to check everything runs OK. Please refer to Deployment Guide for the detailed steps of installation, configuration and deployment of Rosetta.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following is a toy example for matrix multiplication using Rosetta.\n\nIn this example, we assume that three guys want to get the product of their private matrix, while do not want others to know what they hold. For brevity, we call them P0, P1 and P2.\n\nWith Rosetta, each of them can run the following script, from which you can see that only a small amount of codes are needed besides the native TensorFlow lines.\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# Import rosetta package\nimport latticex.rosetta as rtt\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# You can activate a backend protocol, here we use SecureNN\nrtt.activate(\"SecureNN\")\n\n# Get private data from every party\nmatrix_a = tf.Variable(rtt.private_console_input(0, shape=(3, 2)))\nmatrix_b = tf.Variable(rtt.private_console_input(1, shape=(2, 1)))\nmatrix_c = tf.Variable(rtt.private_console_input(2, shape=(1, 4)))\n\n# Just use the native tf.matmul operation.\ncipher_result = tf.matmul(tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b), matrix_c)\n\n# Start execution\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    # Take a glance at the ciphertext\n    cipher_result = sess.run(cipher_result)\n    print('local ciphertext result:', cipher_result)\n    # Set only party a and c can get plain result\n    a_and_c_can_get_plain = 0b101 \n    # Get the result of Rosetta matmul\n    print('plaintext matmul result:', sess.run(rtt.SecureReveal(cipher_result, a_and_c_can_get_plain)))\n```\n\nTo run this jointly, after configuring networks, the three guys can run the following command-line respectively:\n\n```bash\npython rosetta_demo.py --party_id=0\n```\n\n,\n\n```bash\npython rosetta_demo.py --party_id=1\n```\n\nand\n\n```bash\npython rosetta_demo.py --party_id=2\n```\n\nThen each party will be prompted to input his private matrix, for example P0 may have:\n\n> [2020-07-29 20:10:49.070] [info] Rosetta: Protocol [SecureNN] backend initialization succeeded!\n>\n> please input the private data (float or integer, 6 items, separated by space): 2 3 1 7 6 2\n\nNote that input from console like this is purely for pedagogical purpose in this toy example. See our Doc for production-ready data APIs.\n\nAt the end, P0 and P2 will get the plaintext output while P1 dose not, just as required. Specifically, P0 and P2 may have:\n\n> plaintext matmul result: [[b'8.000000' b'14.000000' b'18.000000' b'4.000000']\n> [b'4.000000' b'7.000000' b'9.000000' b'2.000000']\n> [b'24.000000' b'42.000000' b'54.000000' b'12.000000']]\n>\n> [2020-07-29 20:11:06.452] [info] Rosetta: Protocol [SecureNN] backend has been released.\n\nwhile P1 has:\n> plaintext matmul result: [[b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000']\n> [b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000']\n> [b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000' b'0.000000']]\n>\n> [2020-07-29 20:11:06.452] [info] Rosetta: Protocol [SecureNN] backend has been released.\n\nThat's all, you can see Rosetta is so easy to use.\n\nFor more details, please check Tutorials and Examples.\n\n> Note: Currently Rosetta already supports 128-bit integer data type, which can be enabled by configuring the environment variable `export ROSETTA_MPC_128=ON`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo help you start with your first workable program with Rosetta easily, our Tutorials will lead you to this fantastic world. In this detailed tutorials, we will assist you learn the basic concepts about Rosetta, then show you how to use the interfaces that we provide by easy-to-understand examples, and finally help you build a workable privacy-preserving machine learning model on real-world datasets.\n\nHopefully, this tutorial, and more other examples in Examples, will whet your appetite to dive in knowing more about this privacy-preserving framework.\n\n## How Rosetta Works\n\nRosetta works by extending and hacking both Python frontend and the Operation Kernels in backend of TensorFlow. It decouples the development of TensorFlow-related components and privacy technology so that both developers from AI and cryptography can focus on what they are interested.\n\nWhen running your Rosetta program, firstly the native TensorFlow data flow graph will be converted, and during this process the native Operations within the graph will be replaced with SecureOps.\n\nAnd at the second stage, the backend kernels of operations, implemented with specific cryptographic protocol, will be called to carry out underlying secure computation.\n\n## Contributing to Rosetta\n\nRosetta is an open source project developed under the LPGLv3 license and maintained by [LatticeX Foundation](https://latticex.foundation/).
