Avoid chaos and inefficiencies.\n* Set business rules and decision criteria effortlessly without being bounded by complicated structures and frameworks.\n* Let developers leverage RESTful API to convey data and execute business decisions based on management requirements.\n* Avoid complex integration projects or adopting a new software platform to meet your business process management needs.\n* Focus on your core activities rather than lengthy project meetings about how to automate business processes.\n* Automate business processes across any system, device and software platform without any restrictions.\n\n### Utilize Drag & Drop interface\nUtilize Drag & Drop interface to enjoy low-code workflow automation and benefit Rindap’s RESTful API to automate business processes without the need for any integration. Rindap’s easy-to-use drag & drop interface helps you to easily design your workflow as per your business cases’ requirements.\n\nOnce you assembled the big picture, leverage Rindap’s RESTful API as a hub that transfers data and allocates tasks to workers. Send calls with your tasks’ attributes from any application or device that takes part in your workflow to Rindap’s API and carry on with the response you get back according to the workflow you set.\n\n### The logic-based filters\nYou can automate workflows via logical filters that convey your attribute driven tasks to the right work queues which eventually matches the right worker. Yet the story does not simply end there!\nThe task’s attributes get updated according to the workers’ responses and the progress continues to the next filter designated in the workflow. Hence you will be able to carry on the information within the workflow to the next steps and execute decisions automatically.\n\n### Adapt to realistic requirements\nThe workflow is not all about filters matching queues to allocate tasks to workers. Create realistic workflows by utilizing various functions. Set your processes according to your needs, not limitations.\n* Filter True/False: Let your workflow take alternative turns by setting different paths if certain conditions are met or unmet.\n* Loop: You can set a task to be on the loop until it is done.\n* Rate limit: Control task consumption by setting limits.\n* Delay: If some time is required before proceeding to the next step you can set delays.\n* Fork: You can set parallel workflows that run simultaneously by forking.\n\n### Metrics for continuous improvement\nRindap allows you to automate and get insights from your business processes as it aggregates all the task-related data. By identifying areas that you are good at or need to improve, you can easily fine-tune your processes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for the Rindap API can be found [here][apidocs].\n\nThe Python library documentation can be found [here][libdocs].\n\n### Supported Python Versions\n\nThis library supports the following Python implementations:\n\n* Python 2.7\n* Python 3.4\n* Python 3.5\n* Python 3.6\n* Python 3.7\n* Python 3.8\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from PyPi using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/), a\npackage manager for Python.\n\n    pip install rindap\n\nDon't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the command\nline:\n\n    $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python\n\nOr, you can [download the source code\n(ZIP)](https://github.com/rindap/rindap-python-sdk/zipball/master \"rindap-python-sdk\nsource code\") for `rindap-python-sdk`, and then run:\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nYou may need to run the above commands with `sudo`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting started with the Rindap API couldn't be easier. Create a\n`Client` and you're ready to go.\n\n### API Credentials\n\nThe `Rindap` needs your Rindap credentials. You can either pass these\ndirectly to the constructor (see the code below) or via environment variables.\n\n```python\nfrom rindap.rest import Client\n\naccount = \"ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\ntoken = \"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\"\nclient = Client(account, token)\n```\n\nAlternately, a `Client` constructor without these parameters will\nlook for `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN` variables inside the\ncurrent environment.\n\nWe suggest storing your credentials as environment variables. Why? You'll never\nhave to worry about committing your credentials and accidentally posting them\nsomewhere public.\n\n\n```python\nfrom rindap.rest import Client\nclient = Client()\n```\n\n### Create a Workspace\n\n```python\nfrom rindap.rest import Client\n\naccount = \"ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\ntoken = \"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\"\nclient = Client(account, token)\n\nclient.rindap.workspaces.create('a friendly name')\n```\n\n### Handling Exceptions\n\n```python\nfrom rindap.rest import Client\nfrom rindap.base.exceptions import RindapRestException\n\naccount = \"ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\ntoken = \"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\"\nclient = Client(account, token)\n\ntry:\n    client.rindap.workspaces.get(\"WSd8d1e9c8c0384fe7abd63c0abafd1966\").delete()\nexcept RindapRestException as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\nThe `Dockerfile` present in this repository and its respective `rindap/rindap-python-sdk` Docker image are currently used by Rindap for testing purposes only.\n\n### Getting help\n\nIf you need help installing or using the library, please check the [Rindap Support Help Center](https://rindap.com/support/en/).\n\nIf you've instead found a bug in the library or would like new features added, go ahead and open issues or pull requests against this repo!\n\n[apidocs]: https://rindap.com/docs/\n[libdocs]: https://rindap.com/docs/\n\n\n",
