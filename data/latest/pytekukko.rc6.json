Only read operations are implemented (well apart from, strictly\nspeaking, login/logout), and there are no plans to add support for any\nwrite ones.\n\nUsage in a nutshell:\n\n- construct an aiohttp [`ClientSession`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#client-session),\n- construct a `Pytekukko` client with it and your credentials,\n- invoke methods on the client.\n\nThe Omakukko API uses cookie based sessions, use a persistent aiohttp\n[`CookieJar`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#cookiejar)\nto maintain client session across interpreter restarts.\n\nHigh level client methods handle logging in when the need to do so is\ndetected. If the detection is successful, there is no need to\nseparately track session expiration or use the `login` method in the\nfirst place.\n\nFor usage examples, see utilities in the `pytekukko.examples`\npackage. Executables and dependencies for these are installed when the\npackage is installed with the `examples` extra, invoke them with\n`--help` for usage and setup information:\n\n- `pytekukko-collection-schedules`: output collection schedules in JSON\n- `pytekukko-invoice-headers`: output basic info on invoices in JSON\n- `pytekukko-next-collections`: output next collection dates in JSON\n- `pytekukko-update-google-calendar`: update Google Calendar with\n  events for next collections\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis package is not supported by or endorsed by Jätekukko. Do not\nbother them with questions or issues related to it.\n",
