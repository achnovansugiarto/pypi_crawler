Extracted relationships usually occur between two or more entities of a certain type (e.g. Person, Country, Instrument, Region) and fall into a number of semantic categories (e.g. has nationality, plays, located in).\n\n\nNow at [version 0.1.1](https://github.com/ylaxor/relex/releases)!\n\n## Setup\n\nRequires python 3.7.13 or greater.\n\n```\npip install relex\n```\n\n## Motivations and philosphy of the project\n\n* More details on the [relex official documentation](https://relex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/philosophy.html).\n\n## Package documentation and supported use cases\n\n* [Technical details](https://relex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main_sections.html#package-technical-details).\n* [Example of effective use cases](https://relex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore contributing, please read carefully the Context and motivation section, more precisely the paragraph: Bringing together applied research and good coding practice for more details about relex (the project) philosophy and its (the package) design. Therein we attempted to motivate the adopted structure of the package, the role of each sub-package, and we tried to share our vision of how the project can evolve in the future and become more useful.\n\n**Contributing to improve code quality:**\n\n- Report Bugs in existing features\n- Fix reported Bugs\n- Improve existing features\n- Suggest new features\n- Implement new features\n- Write tests\n- Write documentation\n\n**Contributing as applied (NLP) researcher:**\n\n- All the previous\n- Suggest new pipelines\n- Implement new pipelines\n\nRelex lives, by design, on applied research in (NLP).\n\nWe think that any standard deep relation extraction problem can be modelled and successfully solved under the relex package’s high-level design, which adheres to the modular workflow described in the Context and motivation section of the documentation.\n\nPeople are encouraged to participate and make their ideas a tangible part of relex if they conduct research around deep relation extraction and have fresh pipelines in mind that adhere to relex’s spirit (project, and package). In that case, a pipeline would be a collection of routines (data loaders, architectures, learners, predictors, and other miscellaneous utilities) that should each be considered to fit the general deep-learning based framework adopted in relex (c.f. Simplifying the relation extraction problem and following paragraphs) and as a result be able to find its place in the corresponding relex sub-package.\n\n*Contributions are welcomed and much valued! Credit is always given, and every little bit helps.*\n\n[Updated list of contributors](https://relex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/credits.html#list-of-contributors)\n\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease email your feedbacks to [Ali NCIBI](mailto:contact@alincibi.me).\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nRelex is licensed under the following MIT license: The MIT License (MIT) Copyright © 2022 Ali NCIBI\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
