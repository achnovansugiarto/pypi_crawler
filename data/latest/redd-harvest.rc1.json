Why not.\n\n# Install\nThis can be installed using pip:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade redd-harvest\n```\n\n## Setup from source\nA `Makefile` is available that should make it easy (for most UNIX users) to get this project set up.  The only requirements are `python3`, `venv`, and `setuptools`.\n\n```bash\n# Set up a virtual environment and install the project's dependencies:\nmake\n# Activate the virtual environment to interact with a live editable version:\n. ./activate\n# ...and it should be available to run:\nredd-harvest --help\n```\n\n# Options\n```\nGlobal Options:\n  --version  Show the version and exit.\n  --help     Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  run    Run the harvester.\n  setup  Bootstrap an example config in the default location.\n\nOptions for 'run':\n  -c, --config FILE      Path to config file (default: ~/.redd-\n                         harvest/config/redd.yml).\n  -s, --subreddits-only  Only download from configured subreddits (useful in\n                         testing).\n  -r, --redditors-only   Only download from configured redditors (useful in\n                         testing).\n  -o, --only-name TEXT   Only download from a configured entity with the given\n                         name (useful in testing).\n  -i, --interactive      Elevates a few interactive prompts when certain\n                         events occur.\n  --help                 Show this message and exit.\n\nOptions for 'setup':\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n# Configuration\nThis is where a majority of the tuneables live.  A default configuration is not initially provided upon installation, but if you want to use the below example as a starting point, just run `redd-harvest setup`.\n\n## Before getting started\nBefore jumping in and running this, since this interacts with the Reddit API, you need a Reddit account.  Create one at [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/).\n\nNext, at a minimum, you need a Client ID & Client Secret to access Reddit's API as a *script* application (that's what this is!).  If you don't already have those, follow Reddit's [First Steps Guide](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps) to create them.\n\nOnce you have a Client ID & Client Secret, these can be provided to `redd-harvest` via the `REDD_HARVEST_CLIENT_ID` and `REDD_HARVEST_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables, respectively.  This is enough to get you a read-only client to start running.\n\nIf an authorized client is desired, you'll also need to provide your username and password via the `REDD_HARVEST_USERNAME` and `REDD_HARVEST_PASSWORD` environment variables, respectively.  Currently, `redd-harvest` doesn't benefit much from being fully authenticated/authorized, except for seeing an increased upper bound for Reddit's API rate limit.\n\n## Config File Structure\n```yaml\n---\nglobals:\n  # Used in the construction of the user-agent; this should coincide with the\n  # name of the associated app created in your reddit account.\n  app: redd-harvest\n  # Used in user-agent and reddit client construction (if username and password\n  # are not provided via environment variables to build a fully authenticated\n  # reddit client).\n  username: <put-your-username-here>\n  # Default post limit; can be overwritten here, or individually at each\n  # redditor/subreddit entry.\n  post_limit: 5\n  # Direct pass-through to praw rate limit max wait setting.\n  rate_limit_max_wait: 300\n  # Seconds to sleep between fetching submisisons from each configured entity\n  # (a redditor or subreddit). This can be used as a 'protective' measure to\n  # reduce the likelihood of running up against the reddit api rate limits,\n  # even though rate limits should be cleanly handled.\n  backoff_sleep: 0.1\n  # Folder to use for saving content retrieved from submissions.\n  download_folder: ~/.redd-harvest/data\n  # By default pruning is disabled; if set to true, pruning of saved media is \n  # executed before retrieving new posts. Pruning: if we can determine that an\n  # ignored redditor posted in a subreddit that is being followed, attempt to\n  # remove just that redditor's posts from where nested posts would be saved.\n  # If we can determine that a redditor that is being followed has posted in an\n  # ignored subreddit, attempt to remove just posts from that subreddit from\n  # where nested posts would be saved. 'nested' described in more detail below.\n  prune_ignorables: false\n  # When a post is retrieved for an entity (subreddit/redditor), and the post\n  # overlaps with a configured entity of the opposite type, choose which entity\n  # to favor when determining where to store the content from the post. For\n  # example, if user ABC is a redditor we follow, and they also posted content\n  # to a subreddit we're following, it can be chosen whether to favor the\n  # download folder for user ABC or the specific subreddit. Accepted values are\n  # 'redditor', 'subreddit', or 'disabled'. Default is 'redditor'.\n  favor_entity: redditor\n# Individual redditors can be followed the same as subreddits, but none are\n# specified in this example.\nredditors: [] \n# Specify subreddits to follow (case matters for the value of 'name').\nsubreddits:\n  - name: EarthPorn\n    # Within the specified download folder, choose how to store files; 'nested'\n    # means <subreddit>/<redditor> for subreddits, and <redditor>/<subreddit>\n    # for redditors.

A special 'stream' option is also\n      # supported which behaves like 'new', but live streams posts as they are\n      # submitted (which has the side effect of ignoring pinned submissions).\n      sort_type: hot\n  - name: wallpaper\n    # Within the specified download folder, you can also choose to store files\n    # in a 'flat' structure; 'flat' means <subreddit> for subreddits, and\n    # <redditor> for redditors. 'flat' is the default store_type for redditors.\n    store_type: flat\n    search_criteria:\n      post_limit: 15\n      sort_type: top\n      # Some sort types ('top'/'controversial') support toggling a time\n      # boundary; supported values are they same as when normally browsing\n      # reddit ('hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year', 'all').\n      sort_toggle: month\n  - name: wallpapers\n    # Within the specified download folder, you can also choose to store files\n    # in a 'really-flat' structure; 'really-flat' means files will be stored in\n    # the root of the download folder.\n    store_type: really-flat\n    search_criteria:\n      post_limit: 10\n      sort_type: top\n      sort_toggle: year\n# Individual redditors can be ignored the same as subreddits, but none are\n# specified in this example. Example situation: I want to follow a specific\n# subreddit, but I don't care for seeing posts from X redditor. Just specify\n# the name of the redditor (case matters). If a redditor is specified both here\n# and in the redditors section, the redditor will be ignored.\nignored_redditors: []\n# Example situation: I want to follow a specific redditor, but I don't care for\n# seeing their posts in X subreddit.

Deduplication of files only occurs within a single given folder (i.e. deduplication does not occur across folders once a final download location is chosen based on the configuration).\n\nMedia file hashes are calculated before they are written to disk, so this also has a positive side effect of reducing writes to your filesystem.  Even though they're not written to disk, the media needs to be downloaded in order to calculate the hash, so this will still tax the network.\n\nAnother side effect of this scheme is that if you've downloaded some content that you're not interested in keeping, you can prevent `redd-harvest` from continuing to attempt to save the content by truncating the file in place.  If the content is ever encountered again, `redd-harvest` will think it already has a copy because a file name with the SHA1 already exists in the folder.  It's basically a lazy strategy for being able to ignore specific files.\n\n## How is it intended to run?\nThis is designed as a one-shot tool that retrieves content from Reddit serially.  \n\nSince content retrieval executes serially, a sort of parallelism can be accomplished by running multiple instances each with a separate set of configured redditors and/or subreddits to follow.  In this scenario, content deduplication will likely become more difficult for this tool to figure out itself.  Scaling horizontally in this manner might be easier with something like a containerized deployment.  Providing `redd-harvest` in a container is on the to-do list.\n\nIf it's desired to run this continuosly, consider scheduling execution with cron or using a container orchestrator (if you've built your own image, or once an image is provided) with the ability to restart the container after it has stopped.  Features may be added in the future to more elegantly run `redd-harvest` as a background service.\n",
