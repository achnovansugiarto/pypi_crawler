    "description": "# KREPE\n\n## ABOUT:\nCo-Authors Erika Pedersen and Aengus McGuinness created KREPE at a fellowship\nwith the Institute for Computing in Research.\n\n## BACKGROUND INFORMATION:\nIn bioinformatics, it's important to be able to use strands of DNA\nto compare organisms, understand and assemble genomes, and get a better\npicture of how everything works together in an organism. A common tool\nis the k-mer(nucleotide sequences of length k). When a biologist is working\non figuring out a genome, or comparing a cat and a dog, they start with the\nk-mers. The way they work is similar to a paper shredder; you put in a paper\n(or multiple reads of the same sequence), and shred it into bits. Then, you\ntake all the paper bits and piece them back together in the same way as before,\nby finding similarities in each of the pieces. This is useful to biologists\nbecause sometimes there are errors when the machine reads a sequence, so with\nmultiple copies it's simple to find errors and toss them out early so they\ndon't affect the overall 'picture'.\n\nThese k-mers are sometimes strung together to make stringy looking\ngraphs called 'De Bruijn Graphs', that are used to find a pathway through\na genome- this process of finding a pathway is called collapsing. 'Collapsing'\na De Bruijn graph is comparable to cobbling together different bus or train\nroutes that start at the place where the last one ends, and finding a way\nto your destination.\n\nAnother kind of graph that is useful is a bar graph. Bar graphs show the\nappearances of k-mers and can be used to determine the quality of reads\nand determine what type of organism is being seen.\n\nDendrograms can be used to compare any number of organisms to each other\nand see how genetically far apart they are. They have a vertical line from\nthe bottom left to the top right that demonstrates samples intersecting with\nthemselves, and the rest of the squares show intersections between different\nsamples. Venn diagrams are another way to demonstrate the overlap of organisms.\n\nOur program calculates Jaccard similarity (which is basically the amount that\nthings have overlapping, 1.00 being completely the same and 0.00 being completely dissimilar) and uses it for the dendrograms and the venn diagrams. \n\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n The goal of the project is to create a streamlined, easy to use\n package and command line tool that allows users to count k-mers \n and easily generates the following:\n\n - A list of the occurring k-mers in the given file that occur more\n   than once\n - A bar graph that shows the frequency of said k-mer occurrence\n - A De Bruijn graph that can then be used for genome assembly\n - A dendrogram that models genetic similarity and metadata\n - A Venn Diagram that models genetic similarity\n\n The package is protected by copyright under the GNU General Public\n License\n\n## INSTALLATION:\n Use the package manager [pip]\n (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install krepe\n\n ```bash\n$  pip install krepe\n ```\nOR you can install without pip by using git:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/RGBwalnut/Kmer-Counting-Analysis\n```\n\n## USAGE:\n\n The inputs that are allowed are .fasta, .fastq, and .fna. \n\n## ROADMAP:\n This package is completely open-sourced and is being updated by\n authors Erika Pedersen and Aengus McGuinness as needs arise\n\n## CONTRIBUTING:\n Contributions will be accepted, in the instance that the contributor\n is willing to conform with the following:\n\n A. be listed as a minor contributor in the description\n\n B. not be listed under the copyright\n\n C. be willing to hear suggestions on minor changes to the proposed\n contribution\n\nAs well as in the instance the authors deem the\n contribution useful.\n\n\n\n\n",
