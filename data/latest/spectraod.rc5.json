    "description": "SpectrAOD\n------------\n![spectraod_technique](spectraod_ddrf_final.png)\n\n`spectrAOD` is a package for measuring the apparent optical depth, and thus,\n the apparent column density for spectral absorption features as outlined by\n Savage and Sembach in their 1991 paper. Many researchers have their own \n code for performing these measurements but we set out to create an \n open-source, well-maintained python package for people who didn't want to \n reinvent the wheel. Currently, the package has a limited use case scenario \n for Cosmic Origins Spectrograph data at a redshift of zero, but we hope to \n expand the capabilities of the package in terms of what missions are \n supported, the computation abilities, and visualization for these \n calculations. Stay tuned!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is registered on PyPI and available via `pip`. `pip` \ninstallations will provide the latest version released to PyPI, and is \nsufficient for installing the package. However, in case you would like the \nlatest version, between published releases, we also offer \ninstructions on how to install by cloning the repository. You will need a \nworking, and preferably current version of Anaconda.\n\n> N.B.: If you are having any issues with installation, please consult the \n[Common Issues](#common-issues) section.\n\n##### Make a new environment\n```\nconda create --name <environment_name> python=3.5 <other packages>\n```\n`<other packages>` simply denotes any other packages you may wish to install\n in this environment, such as `stsci` or `notebook`. All required packages \n for `spectrAOD` will be installed as a dependency automatically.\n\nActivate the new environment with:\n```\nconda activate <environment_name>\n```\nWe recommend a short and simple name for the environment such as `spectraod`.\n\n##### Install with `pip` (Latest published release, recommended)\n\nFrom the command line, in your new environment:\n```\npip install spectrAOD==1.1.0\n```\n\nYou can drop the version number and just use the name of the package if you \nwould like the version most recently published. `pip` will also give you \ninstructions on how to upgrade your version if there is a newer published \none available.\n\n##### Clone the repository and install it (Latest version, recommended for developers only)\n\nThis repository has a button near the top where you can click for the link \nto clone or download. Choose the https version unless you have set up an ssh\ntoken for Github. \nMove into the directory that you would like this package to live in, then:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/cmagness/spectrAOD.git\ncd spectrAOD\npip install .\n```\nAlternately, if you are having issues installing with `pip`, you can also \nuse `python setup.py install`.\n\nSet Up\n-----------------\n\nThere are several files involved in running this package:\n1. Your settings file (see [Configuring Main Settings](#configuring-main-settings))\n2. Your target list (only required for `ASCII` filetypes. see [Setting a\n Target List](#setting-a-target-list))\n3. Your batch table (only required for [Batch Mode](#batch-mode))\n4. Your ions list (optional, a simple one is built into the package. see\n [Ions List](#ions-list))\n\nAdditionally, you will need to [choose a method](#package-access-to-settings) for the settings file\n to be\n accessed by the package.\n\n#### Configuring Main Settings\n\nIn this repository you will see a file called `sample_settings.yaml`. You \nwill need a settings file to use this package that is of the same format. \nCopy the settings file and rename it as you please, but retain the `.yaml` \nextension. If you've installed via `pip`, you will not be easily able to find this file. Create a `.yaml` file \nand make sure it has the following information in it:\n\n```\ninputs:\n  # string: path to data\n  datadir:\n  # string: path to output directory\n  outdir:\n  # string: path to target list. use an empty string for X1DSUM filetype\n  targets:\n\nparameters:\n  # string: ion\n  ion:\n  # string: instrument\n  instrument:\n  # string: filetype\n  filetype:\n  # int: minimum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_min:\n  # int: maximum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_max:\n  # string: grating\n  grating:\n  # float: redshift in z. use 0.0 for MW\n  redshift:\n\ndefaults:\n  # string: path to your batch table\n  batch_table: \"\"\n  # string: target name. only required for ASCII filetypes\n  target: \"\"\n  # list[int, int]: specify continuum windows to measure from, velocity (km/s)\n  continuum_left: [-450, -300]\n  continuum_right: [300, 450]\n  # bool: show_plot=True displays visualization before being saved\n  show_plot: False\n  # bool: galactic=True assumes target list coordinates are galactic instead\n  # of equatorial (default)\n  galactic: False\n  # string: path to ions file if not using default ions list\n  all_ions: \"mini_ions.csv\"\n```\nBrief explanations of each keyword are provided via comments in the file; \nhowever see [About the Settings](#about-the-settings) for more information. \n\n#### Setting a Target List\n\n**If you are working with `X1DSUM` data you do not need a target list and\ncan skip this section. The RA and DEC used to calculate the LSR correction\nwill be retrieved from the file header. Just make sure to set `targets: \"\"`.**\n\nIn the settings file you will notice one of the parameters asks for the path\nto your target list file. Explicitly, this needs to be a **path to a target \nlist** and **NOT** a list of targets. \n\nTo perform the LSR correction `spectrAOD` needs a target list with the\n target name and corresponding coordinates. You can see the format for this\nfile (it must be a csv at this time) in `sample_targets.csv`. Feel free to \nuse that file to build your target list. The expected coordinates of this\n  file are controlled with the settings keyword `galactic`. By default, \n  `galactic=False`, and `spectrAOD` will expect equatorial coordinates and\n   column names for RA and DEC. If you would like to use galactic\n    coordinates, you may change `galactic` to `True` and then change the\n     values and column names accordingly.\n\n#### Ions List\n\nYou should leave the `all_ions` field as is to use the list of \"mini_ions.csv\" \nincluded with the package, unless you wish to provide the path to your own\nlist. If you choose to use your own ions list, you may either copy the mini \nlist from the repository and add to it in the same format, or you may create \nan entirely new ions file with four columns, a header column, and the values \nspace separated as follows:\n\n ```\nion wavelength f(oscillating strength) damping\n<STR:ION> <FLOAT:WAVELENGTH> <FLOAT:f> <FLOAT:damping>\n```\n> N.B.: the column names don't particularly matter as long as you have a \nheader column.\n\n#### Package Access to Settings\n\nFor `spectrAOD` to find the `settings.yaml` file, you have two options:\n\n##### Set an environment variable (Recommended)\n\nWe recommend creating an environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `\n.bash_profile` to point to this file. To do so, open your `.bashrc` or `\n.bash_profile` in a text editor (this will be a hidden file in your home \ndirectory if you are unfamiliar) and then add the line:\n```\nexport SPECTRAOD_SETTINGS=\"/path/to/your/settings/file\"\n```\nSave and close your `.bash_profile` and then activate these changes with:\n```\nsource .bash_profile\n```\nNow `spectrAOD` will know where to look for your file. If you decide to move\nit, just update the path.\n\n##### Move your copy (Slightly faster)\n\nIf you don't want to mess with setting an environment variable, that is just\n fine. You can move your settings file to the directory you plan to run the \n package from and `spectrAOD` will look for a `.yaml` file if no environment\n  variable is set. Just be warned that it will look for _any_ `.yaml` file. \n\nUsage\n-----------------------\n#### About the Settings \n\nThis section is meant to provide more information about the settings\n keywords. Feel free to skip ahead to [Command Line](#command-line) or\n  [Batch Mode](#batch-mode) if you understand how to populate the settings. \n\n##### Inputs\n\nThe first section of the settings file is the inputs:\n\n```\ninputs:\n  # string: path to data\n  datadir:\n  # string: path to output directory\n  outdir:\n  # string: path to target list. use an empty string for X1DSUM filetype\n  targets:\n```\n\nThis is fairly self explanatory. For the `datadir` and `outdir` keywords, \nplease provide the path to your directory containing your datasets and the\n directory you would like the measurements and visualizations written to, \n respectively. For `targets`, please see \n [Setting a Target List](#setting-a-target-list).\n\n##### Parameters\n\nThe main section of the settings that you will use is `parameters`:\n\n```\nparameters:\n  # string: ion\n  ion:\n  # string: instrument\n  instrument:\n  # string: filetype\n  filetype:\n  # int: minimum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_min:\n  # int: maximum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_max:\n  # string: grating\n  grating:\n  # float: redshift in z. use 0.0 for MW\n  redshift:\n```\n\nThese parameters are all **required** to run `spectrAOD`, and can all be\n updated in real time from the command line when running a single\n  measurement. They can also be distinct for separate measurements in [Batch\n   Mode](#batch-mode).\n\n`ion`: The ion to perform the measurement for.\n\n`instrument`: The instrument the data was taken on. Currently only supports\n`\"COS\"`, although other values will cause a graceful exit.\n\n`filetype`: The filetype of the data. Currently supported filetypes\ninclude `\"X1DSUM\"`, `\"ASCII\"`, `\"BART\"`, and `\"BART-N\"`.\n\n`vel_min/vel_max`: The velocity windows you would like to perform the\nmeasurement in, units of km/s.\n\n`grating`: The grating of the mode used to take the data. Only applies for\n `X1DSUM` filetypes.\n\n`redshift`: The z value of the target. Use `0.0` for Milky Way targets.\n\n##### Defaults\n\nGenerally, the default keywords do not need to be changed unless you prefer to, \nwith the exception of the `target` keyword in the instance of `ASCII\n` filetypes.\n\n```\ndefaults:\n  # string: path to your batch table\n  batch_table: \"\"\n  # string: target name. only required for ASCII filetypes\n  target: \"\"\n  # list[int, int]: specify continuum windows to measure from, velocity (km/s)\n  continuum_left: [-450, -300]\n  continuum_right: [300, 450]\n  # bool: show_plot=True displays visualization before being saved\n  show_plot: False\n  # bool: galactic=True assumes target list coordinates are galactic instead\n  # of equatorial (default)\n  galactic: False\n  # string: path to ions file if not using default ions list\n  all_ions: \"mini_ions.csv\"\n```\n\n`batch_table`: For [batch mode](#batch-mode) only. Otherwise should be an\n empty string/empty.\n\n`target`: For `ASCII` filetypes only. The name of the target, must be\n included in the filename for the data, and must match the target name in\n  your target list.\n\n`continuum_left/right`: Continuum windows (km/s) that are used to make\n continuum measurements and thus normalize the data. The default windows\n  tend to be sufficient for most datasets, but you are free to change them\n   as you wish.\n\n`show_plot`: Whether or not the visualization is displayed during runtime. \nThe visualization will be saved regardless of whether the plot is shown, \nbut by default `show_plot=False` and the plot will not be displayed. If you\n choose to have the plot displayed at runtime, you must exit the popup\n  window before `spectrAOD` can continue.\n\n`galactic`: Determines the coordinate system in the target list. By default, \n`galactic=False` and equatorial coordinates are expected. `galactic=True` \nexpects galactic coordinates. Because this only applies to the target list,\nthe value of this keyword does not matter for `X1DSUM` filetypes.\n\n`all_ions`: see [Ions List](#ions-list)\n\n#### Command Line\n\n`spectrAOD` is equipped with entry points for both the command line and\n [batch mode](#batch-mode) options. Entry points are shortcuts in a package,\n  that once installed, allow a user to access a certain part of the code\n  from the command line in the environment the package is installed in. The\n   entry point for the command line, single use case, is `measure`.\n\nTo run the default measurements you've put in the settings file, from the\n command line, in any directory (but within the correct environment), enter:\n```\nmeasure\n```\nor, from within the package level:\n```\npython measure_aod.py\n```\n\nTo see the full list of parameter options, run:\n```\nmeasure --help\n```\n\nThis will give you information about all the parameters you can change from \nthe command line (see [Parameters](#parameters)). By default, `spectrAOD` \nwill use the values in your settings file but you can alter any of them from \nthe default by adding the correct flag at the command line.\n\nSay you perform a measurement of an ion in the region from -100 to 100 km/s\n but then decide it may be advantageous to perform the measurement in the window \nfrom -100 to 150 km/s. You can do this without making changes to your \nsettings file by running:\n```\nmeasure --vel_max 150\n```\n\n#### Batch Mode\n\nBatch mode is a new feature of `spectrAOD 1.0.0` that allows you to make\n multiple measurements, of multiple ions and multiple targets, at once. You\n  will see a file in the repository, `sample_batch_table.csv` that has the\n   correct format for the required table, or you may make your own from the\n    format below:\n\n```\n,ROOTNAME,TARGET,ION,INSTRUMENT,FILETYPE,VEL_MIN,VEL_MAX,GRATING,REDSHIFT\n0,rootname, target, ion, instrument, filetype, vel_min, vel_max, grating,\nredshift\n1,rootname, target, ion, instrument, filetype, vel_min, vel_max, grating,\nredshift\n```\n\nEach column is required, and must have a value populated in each row, as in\n this mode, the keywords in your settings file corresponding to the column\n  name replace the defaults in your settings file. The exception is the\n   `TARGET` column, which must still exist but whose values only matter for\n    `ASCII` filetypes.\n\nFor each row (and therefore file) in the table, `spectrAOD` will perform a\n measurement equivalent to altering those keywords in your settings file. It\n  does **not** actually change your settings file. All other values in the \n  settings file will remain the same across all measurements and will be\n   sourced from there.\n\n> N.B.: Because of this, it is highly recommended that `show_plot` remains\n> `False`.\n\nThe entry point for batch mode is simply `batch`. There are no optional\n arguments:\n\n```\nbatch\n```\nor, from within the package level:\n```\npython batch_run.py\n```\n\n#### Visualization\n\nAnother new feature of `spectrAOD 1.0.0.` is the primitive visualization\n module. The visualizations are automatically saved as `.pngs` to your\n  output directory, and are optionally displayed during runtime with the\n   keyword `show_plot=True`.  \n\nOther\n-----\n\n#### Common Issues\n\nThe following are issues encountered by people during the use of this \npackage. These are usually due to machine level installation problems but \nthey are being documented here in case someone else runs into a similar issue.\n\n* *Problem*: If you encounter an issue, error message, or traceback \nreferencing or relating to `setuptools`, you may have a corrupt version of the \npackage. \n*Solution*: You may need to uninstall your version before installing \n`spectrAOD`. You can do this with `pip uninstall setuptools` and then you \nshould be able to proceed with `spectrAOD` installation as usual. `spectrAOD` \nwill install a new version of `setuptools` for you.\n\nShould you encounter any other issues with the use of this package, please \nopen a new issue on the repository [here](https://github.com/cmagness/spectrAOD/issues).\n\n<!---\n\nContributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n3rd Party Libraries this package requires\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n---> \n\n",
