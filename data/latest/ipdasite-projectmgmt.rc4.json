Well, the \"Members\" tab was already a\r\nmisnomer, as it was an instance of a \"Steering Committee Display\" object whose\r\nsole purpose was to show those registered users who were in the group \"SC\".\r\nWell, now that object's view also has a section for \"TEG\" members.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0.0 - Plone 4\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis release of the IPDA Project Management brings about Plone 4\r\ncompatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright & License\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCopyright 2008-2011 by the California Institute of Technology.
