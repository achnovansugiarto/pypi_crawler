    "description": "# serverless-pypi\n\nAn AWS Lambda implementation for the PyPI protocols.\n\nPython packaging is fantastic; however, challenges arise when you need to use standard PyPI (e.g. - pip) mechanms in CI/CD but you need to manage private projects. In this situation, you are generally limited to implementing complex open-source solutions (e.g. - warehouse, devpi, etc.) or paying for expensive commercial solutions (e.g. - Artifactory).\n\n`serverless-pypi` is designed to largely elimiate these challenges. It is an AWS Lambda function that secures your private packages while fully mirroring *any* underlying repository, and it does all of this with **only the Lambda function itself and an S3 bucket**.\n\n`serverless-pypi`:\n1. Implements the PyPI simple JSON and HTML protocols and PyPI's upload protocol\n2. Pull-through mirrors a base repository (https://pypi.org/simple by default; this may be another private repository if you wish)\n3. Allows for localized upload of private packages; private packages with the same name as mirrored packages will override the mirror.\n4. Manages users for both download and upload roles\n\n## Performance\n`serverless-pypi` is *fast* for `pip install` requests, as these requests are eventually redirected to AWS S3 presigned URLs. This is particularly true when you are accessing `serverless-pypi` within AWS itself.\n\nUploads using `twine` are still quite fast, but since these must be processed directly by the Lambda function will be slower than downloads. New packages uploaded will be made availabe within a few seconds. New files uploaded to an existing package are available immediately.\n\n## Installation\n`serverless-pypi` can be obtained from:\n1. the `lambdalambdalambda` repo as a fully built Lamba package (https://lambdalambdalambda-repo-<region>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/quinovas/serverless-pypi/serverless-pypi-<version>.zip). Currently `lambdalambdalambda` supports the `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2` and `eu-west-1`. For `us-east-1` simply use no region (e.g. - https://lambdalambdalambda-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/quinovas/serverless-pypi/serverless-pypi-0.0.6.zip).\n2. cloning and building via `python setup.py ldist` (note the build *must* be done on an `Amazon Linux 2` host).\n3. installing into a folder using `pip install --target build_dir serverless-pypi`, and then zipping `build_dir` into a lambda package (note the build *must* be done on an `Amazon Linux 2` host).\n\n> Note - all `lambdalambdalambda` buckets are publicly available.\n\n### AWS Deployment\n`serverless-pypi` may be deployed in AWS in the following ways:\n1.  As a stand-alone Lambda function utilizing a [Lambda function URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html).\n2. Fronted by an API Gateway, using either REST or HTTP.\n3. Fronted by an AWS ALB.\n4. As a Lambda@Edge function.\n\n### Lambda settings\nThe Python 3.9 runtime is required.\n\nWe recommend that you provide at least 1536GB of memory to ensure speedy responses.\n\nIf you are deploying `serverless-pypi` stand-alone, you will need to provision a Lambda Function URL. If you wish to throttle invocations, limit the function's cconcurrency.\n\n### Environment Variables\n| Variable | Required | Description | Default |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| API_GATEWAY_BASE_PATH | N | Sets the base path for the Lambda function. Only applicable if this is fronted by an AWS API Gateway. | / |\n| BUCKET | Y | The AWS S3 bucket that is used to store the PyPI information. | |\n| LOGGING_LEVEL | N | Sets the logging level for the Lambda function | INFO |\n| UPSTREAM_INDEX_URL | N | The url underlying PyPI repository to mirror. This may contain credentialing information. | https://pypi.org/simple/ |\n| REPO_BASE_PREFIX | N | The prefix to use in the S3 bucket. | \"\" |\n\n### IAM Permissions\n| Permission | Resource | Note |\n| - | - | - |\n| s3:GetObject | {BUCKET}/{REPO_BASE_PREFIX}/* | Retrieval of stored indexes, packages and users |\n| s3:PutObject | {BUCKET}/{REPO_BASE_PREFIX}/* | Storage of indexes, packages and users |\n| s3:ListBucket | {BUCKET}/{REPO_BASE_PREFIX}/* | Listing of stored private packages and users |\n| lambda:InvokeFunction | itself | Allows automated reindexing when a new package is uploaded |\n| lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration | itself | Allows for forced restart of the function when reindexing and putting/removing users |\n\n> Note - additional permissions will be required based upon you deployment method.\n\n## Using `serverless-pypi`\n\n### `pip install` or equivalent\nThe repository base URI is `/simple/`. Depending on your deployment method you will need to add this to the base URL of the deployment (e.g. - for stand-alone deployment, this will be the Lambda Function URL).\n\nFor example, to `pip install simplejson` you would:\n```sh\npip install --index-url https://{my_user}:{my_password}@{my_lambda_function_url}/simple simplejson\n```\n\n## Uploading private packages using `twine` or equivalent\n`serverless-pypi` will automatically create a new project for the first package file uploaded for the project. This has been fully tested with `twine`; if you use a different upload method modify accordingly.\n\nUploads are `POST`ed to the root path of the repository.\n\nFor example, uploading the `foobar` wheel using `twine` would look like:\n```sh\ntwine upload --repository-url \"https://{my_lambda_function_url}/\" --username {my_user} --password {my_password} foobar-0.0.1-py3-non-any.whl\n```\n\n\n## Managing `serverless-pypi`\n\n### Users\n`serverless-pypi` maintains its own, internal username/password database in order to conform to PyPI's HTTP Basic authentication requirements. There is no public, anonymous access.\n\nTwo user types are supported: users that are able to read the repository (e.g. - `pip` users) and users that can read and write the repository (e.g. - `twine` users)\n\nThe usernames themselves are one-way hashed (using `sha256`), and the passwords are hashed using `pbkdf2_sha512`. This provides an irreversable mechanism to securely store user information.\n\nManaging users requries directly invoking the deployed Lambda function; invocation can be either an event or request/response invocation, although the latter will only report errors.\n\n| Action | Description | Event Payload |\n| - | - | - |\n| Put user | Adds/updates a user | ```{\"putUser\": {\"username\": \"my_user\", \"password\": \"my_password\", \"upload\": [true/false]}}``` |\n| Remove user | Removes a user | ```{\"removeUser\": \"my_user\"}```\n\n### Reindexing\nSince the underlying mirrored PyPI repository will change periodically, it is necessary to reindex your `serverless-pypi` repository periodically.\n\nTo do this, simply invoke the deployed Lambda function with the payload `\"reindex\"`. When this payload is received, `serverless-pypi` will pull the mirror's master index, reindex your instance and restart your deployed Lambda function.\n\n### Keeping the Lambda function warm\nStartup of the Lambda function is somewhat expensive since the total index (~8MB) is loaded and parsed into memory; therefore, you may desire to keep the Lambda function \"warm\" to make sure that it responds promptly to your `pip` and `twine` requests.\n\nThis is accomplished via any invocation (e.g. - an AWS EventBus Scheduled Event) that does not come from ALB, AWS Gateway, the Lambda's Function URL or Lambda@Edge, or does not match the user management or reindexing invocation payloads.\n\n## Limitations\nUploads from `twine` to your `serverless-pypi` repository are limited to package files of 6MB or less.\n\n> Note - you may, if you wish, directly upload larger packages to the correct location in the S3 bucket. If you choose to do this, you must replicate the key/file structure that `serverless-pypi` uses, and then force a reindex after your upload.\n\nThere are no limitations on package file sizes that are downloaded.\n\n\n",
