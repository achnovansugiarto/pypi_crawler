    "description": "The `TechGame Framework for Python`_ is a toolkit for skinning GUIs using a blend of XML, CSS, and Python.\n\nThe workflow using this framework is similar to standard GUI development\nwith a twist of web design thrown in.  The `skinning framework`_ is a\ngeneralized engine to build objects from XML.  To this engine, we have\nadded an XML namespace 'TG.skinning.toolkits.wx' for our binding with\nthe excellent `wxPython libraries`_.  Using the skinning framework to\nfactor your wxPython GUI into an XML form allows for a nice layer of\ninsulation between GUI manipulation and model code.  And once that\nseparation is accomplished, you can even go to the point of replacing\nyour GUI skin dynamically.  Additionally, employing the `CSS\nfacilities`_ allows you to localize choices about the look and feel of\ninterfaces across the breadth of your application.  Then, *when* you\nchange your mind, you can quickly test your ideas by changing the\nstylesheet.  Or, in a more sophisticated application, change styles to\nmatch the platform you are running on.\n\nIf you are interested, please read more about the TG Framework at the\n`project website`_, as well as download the `1.0a1 Milestone Release`_.\nYou also might be interested in our `CSS tools`_ separate from the\nframework.  They are packaged in parallel with the framework, and can\nalso be found on the `release page`_.\n\n.. _1.0a1 Milestone Release:\n.. _release page: \n  http://www.techgame.net/projects/Framework/wiki/MilestoneRelease1.0a1\n.. _TechGame Framework for Python:\n.. _project website: \n  http://www.techgame.net/projects/Framework/wiki/WikiStart\n.. _CSS tools:\n.. _CSS facilities: \n  http://www.techgame.net/projects/Framework/wiki/CSSEngine\n.. _skinning framework: \n  http://www.techgame.net/projects/Framework/wiki/SkinningFramework\n.. _wxPython libraries: \n  http://wxpython.org",
