    "description": "# atomprobe-data-modeling\n\n## Mission:\nFoster exchange about data models and work towards specifications\nof file formats from the research field of atom probe microscopy.\n\n## Documentation of file formats and data models in atom probe status quo\nDetailed technical specifications of the file formats and data models are not\navailable for all formats in the field of atom probe microscopy.\nA practical solution to address this limitation so far has been that scientists collect\nexamples in respective formats, so-called instances, and inspect and share these.\nBased on this reverse engineering, individual atom probers have contributed to formulate\nwhat can be considered likely candidates of the specification for several file formats.\nThis worked especially well for the POS and ePOS formats.\n\nPieces of information about file formats are reported in the literature in e.g.\nbooks by D. Larson et al. and B. Gault et al. Atom probers like D. Haley have contributed\nsubstantially to make the community aware of existent limitations and these\nreverse engineering practices. AMETEK/Cameca is the key technology partner in atom probe.\nThe company has created an open file format called APT which improves the accessibility of\nspecific numerical data and some metadata. Individuals like M. KÃ¼hbach have driven the\nimplementation and communication of parsers for this APT file format.\n\nNowadays there is an increased interest and demand placed on atom probers by the funding\nagencies that researchers should and have to make their research data management and data\nstewardship better matching and more completely aligned to the aims and practices of\nF.A.I.R. research principles. Therefore, it is useful to exchange more details about\ndata models and file formats as otherwise it is not foreseeable how atom probe data\ncan be made really interoperable with electronic lab notebooks, research data management\nsystems (RDMS), and related software tools.\n\nIn light of these challenges, the idea of understanding formats just by examples,\nshowed to be a slow and error-prone route as e.g. source code and workflows which have\nbeen useed to write such files, and the associated input, workflow, and provenance information\nmight have been or not captured or/and the specific software tool(s) used might not have been\nshared or made accessible for reviewing and analyzing their functions.\n\n## Benefit and Next Steps\nYou can easily imagine that the more people will support us with this work the\nmore complete our understanding and knowledge about the available file formats\nin atom probe microscopy can and will become. This can help all of us in the\nlong run to build software tools which are more reliable and thrustworthy and\nalso technically more robust when it comes to parse research data - irrespective\nfrom which tools these come or how you would like to used these data further\nthroughout your journey of digitalizing your atom probe research.\n\nThe Python parsers in this repository are meant as a motivation to offer\nimmediate benefit to users. The collection of examples and technical discussions\nvia issues serves the more long-term aim. This is to arrive at a detailed technical\nspecification rather than more robust parsers only so that atom probe data can be\nexchanged across tools irrespective of their formatting.\n\n# Getting started as developer\n\nYou should create a virtual environment. We tested on Ubuntu with Python 3.7.\nNewer versions of Python should work similarly (for this change 3.7) to the\ndesired version tag.\n\nIf you don't have Python 3.7 installed on your computer, follow these commands:\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\nsudo apt install python3.7 python3-dev libpython3.7-dev python3.7-venv\n```\n\nIn some cases when using Python3.7 it was necessary to install python-numpy in others\nnot. So consider this if you run into issues when continuing this manual.\nThe following steps will install the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling module in the\nlatest version.\n\n```\nmkdir <your-brand-new-folder>\ncd <your-brand-new-folder>\npip install virtualenv\nvirtualenv --python=python3.7 .py37\nsource .py37/bin/activate\n\ngit clone git@github.com:atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling.git\ncd ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling\npip install .\npip install --upgrade pip\npip list\n```\n\nYou can find instructions about how to use this tool in the tests/data jupyter notebook.\nThis notebook can be started from the command line inside the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling\ndirectory simply by calling.\n\n```\njupyter-lab\n```\n\n\n## Support us with this work\nThank you very much for supporting this activity and your time.\n\n## Feedback, questions\nFeel free to drop us a message via creating an issue or commenting on one.\nFeel invited to use the resources in this repository.\n\n## Where to place your examples?\nThere is a *examples_with_provenance* and *examples_without_provenance*\nsub-directory for each file format.\n\nWhen you do know with which software and measured dataset you have created a file,\nyou should share the file and these pieces of information (software version). Do so by\nnaming at least the respective raw files. Ideally you share the examples via offering\na link to an external data repository such as Zenodo or other providers. This not only\navoids that this repository would get too much filled up with binary data.\nAlso it enables you to share clearly under which license you would like make your\nexample(s) accessible.\n\n## Provenance if possible, plain examples if in doubt\nUse the *examples_with_provenance* sub-directory. With this it is at least possible\nto reproduce the file creation. A practical solution is to share (by uploading)\nthe screenshot of the complete IVAS/APSuite version info screen, including\nthe APSuite version, the CernRoot version, the CamecaRoot version, and the versions\nof libraries used by APSuite. This can help other atom probers and AMETEK/Cameca\nto improve their software as it enables them to identify inconsistencies\nor bugs eventually easier.\n\nAtom probers should be aware that file formats like POS, ePOS, or APT are neither\nraw data nor follow a clear technical documentation. Therefore, all current file\nformats are not meeting the FAIR principles.ey specified. Instead, refer to RRAW,\nSTR, RHIT and/or HITS files. Ideally, you add unique identifiers (such as SHA256\nchecksums) for each raw file. A documentation how you can do this was issued by \nyour IFES APT TC colleagues [(How to hash your data)](https://github.com/oxfordAPT/hashlist).\n\nIf you cannot provide such detailed pieces of information to your work you can\nstill participate and support us a lot if you share your knowledge by adding at\nleast a link to a repository or file share with content in the relevant atom-probe\n-specific file formats.\nIn this case, please use the *examples_without_provenance* directory.\nWhile these examples are stripped of the context in which they were created\nand used (provenance information), these examples can still be very useful\nto run the file formats parsers against to make the parsers more robust.\n\n# Background information\nFile formats, data models, in (almost every) research field may not be \nfully documented. A checklist of the necessary pieces of information and \ndocumentation required to call a data model, data schema, and/or file format\nfully documented in accordance with the FAIR data and research software stewardship\nprinciples is given below:\n\n1. Each piece of information (bit/byte) is documented.\n2. This documentation fulfills the FAIR principles, i.e.\n   [Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) and\n   [Barker et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)\n   For binary files, tools like [kaitai struct](https://kaitai.io/) offer a\n   solution to describe the exact binary information content in a data\n   item. This can be a file but also the storage of a database entry or the\n   response of a call to an API.  Let alone the binary structure is insufficient,\n   tough.\n3. To each piece of information there has to exist also a parameterized description,\n   what this piece of information conceptually means. One way to arrive at such\n   description is to use a data schema or ontology.\n   It is important to mention that the concepts in this schema/ontology have\n   unique identifier so that each data item/piece of information is identifiable\n   as an instance of an entry in a database or a knowledge graph.\n   This holds independently of which research data management system\n   or electronic lab notebook is used.\n4. In addition, it is very useful that timestamps are associated with \n   each data item (ISO8061 with time zone information) so that it is possible\n   to create a timeline of the context in which and when the e.g. file was created.\n\nThe first and second point is known as a specification, while the third and fourth\npoint emphasize that the contextualization and provenance is key to make a\nspecification complete and useful.\n",
