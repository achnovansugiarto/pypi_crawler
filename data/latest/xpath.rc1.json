IMPORTANT::\n\n  This module is in the \"planning\" stage (i.e. no code to download\n  yet).\n\nApply XPath_ expressions to extract objects from *any* Python objects.\n\nFor XML-based objects, this library defers to the standard\nElementTree_ implementation.\n\nFor non-XML-based objects, it provides a pure-Python implementation of\nthe XPath_ spec... with some \"caveats\". Since Python objects are not\nXML objects, things like a \"namespace\" need to be adapted in terms of\nexactly what they mean.\n\n.. _XPath: https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/\n.. _ElementTree: https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#elementtree-xpath",
