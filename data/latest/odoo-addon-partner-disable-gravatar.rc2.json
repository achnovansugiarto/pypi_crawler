That way, his picture/avatar will be automatically set on all websites that are connected to gravatar.com: he won't have to manually configure his picture/avatar on every website.\n\nIn Odoo, when you enter an email address in the form view of a partner (i.e. triggered via the *onchange* on the *email* field) and this partner doesn't have any image yet in Odoo, Odoo will automatically send an HTTPS query to `www.gravatar.com <https://www.gravatar.com/>`_ with an MD5 hash of the email of the partner. If it receives an answer from gravatar.com in the form of a picture within the 5 seconds timeout, it will set this picture on the *image* field of the partner in Odoo.\n\nSome people may consider it as a cool feature to easily get picture on partners with no effort.\n\nBut other people may consider this as an annoying feature that adds unnecessary network trafic or, worse, as a leak of information. With this feature, gravatar.com is notified of all the email addresses added in the Odoo database, so it may be considered as a leak of information to a third party company (gravatar.com is operated by `Automattic Inc. <https://automattic.com/contact/>`_, an American company). The problem is that there is no way to disable this feature via a configuration parameter of Odoo. This module brings a solution to this problem: once installed, it disables the feature.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact/issues/new?body=module:%20partner_disable_gravatar%0Aversion:%2016.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-alexis-via| image:: https://github.com/alexis-via.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/alexis-via\n    :alt: alexis-via\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-alexis-via| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/partner-contact <https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact/tree/16.0/partner_disable_gravatar>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
