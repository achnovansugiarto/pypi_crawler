And, of course, a working \nGNU Health HMIS instance. \n\n  $ pip3 install --upgrade --user gnuhealth-fhir-server\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThe server ships with a simple production config file (server/config.py). However, \nit needs to be edited.::\n\n TRYTON_DATABASE = ''    # GNU Health database\n SERVER_NAME = ''        # Domain name of the server (e.g., fhir.example.com)\n SECRET_KEY = ''         # Set this value to a long and random string\n\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nUse TLS. Sensitive medical information must be protected and confidential.\n\nBy default, all FHIR endpoints except the Conformance statement require user \nauthentication. The user authentication and access follows Tryton's model, \nrespecting model and field access rights.\n\nThe same credentials used to sign into GNU Health are used to access the \nFHIR REST server.\n\n\nRunning the server\n------------------\n\nFor development, you can just run the fhir_server python program.\n\nFor production environments, you should run it from a WSGI container,\nsuch as gunicorn, uWSGI or Tornado.\n\n* *server_tornado*: Runs the GNUHealth FHIR server behind tornado\n* *server_gunicorn*: Runs the GNUHealth FHIR server behind tornado\n\nThe *log* file will be stored at the user's home directory, with the name\n\"fhir_server.log\".\n\nTechnology\n----------\nThe GNU Health HMIS FHIR server is built on Flask technology \n(http://flask.pocoo.org/) .\n\nMore information about Flask and its addons used in GNU Health FHIR server:\n\n- `Flask <https://flask.pocoo.org/>`_\n- `Flask-Login <https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_\n- `Flask-Tryton <https://pypi.org/project/flask-tryton/>`_\n- `Flask-Restful <http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_\n- `Flask-WTF <https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\nThe development of GNU Health is on GNU Savannah, using the Mercurial repository.\n\nTasks, bugs and mailing lists will be on health-dev@gnu.org , for development.\n\nGeneral discussion is done at health@gnu.org mailing list.\n\n\nHomepage\n--------\nhttps://www.gnuhealth.org\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe GNU Health FHIR server documentation will be at the corresponding\nchapter in the GNU Health Wikibook\n\nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_Health\n\n\nSupport GNU Health\n-------------------\n\nGNU Health is a project of GNU Solidario. GNU Solidario is an Non-profit\nNon-goverment-Organization (NGO) that works globally, focused on Social Medicine.\n\nHealth and education are the basis for the development and dignity of societies.\n\nYou can also **donate** to our project via :\n\nhttps://www.gnuhealth.org/donate/\n\nIn addition, you can show your long time commitment to GNU Health by\n**becoming a member** of GNU Solidario, so together we can further\ndeliver Freedom and Equity in Healthcare around the World.\n\nhttps://my.gnusolidario.org/join-us/\n\nGNU Solidario hosts IWEEE and GnuHealthCon:\n\nThe International Workshop on e-Health in Emerging Economies- a good way to\nsupport GNU Solidario and to get the latest on e-Health is to assist\nto the conferences.\n\nhttps://www.gnuhealthcon.org/\n\n\nNeed help to implement GNU Health ?\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe are committed to do our best in helping out projects that can improve\nthe health of your country or region. We want the project to be a success,\nand since our resources are limited, we need to work together to make a great\nand sustainable project.\n\nIn order to be elegible, we need the following information from you,\nyour NGO or government:\n\n* An introduction of the current needs\n* The project will only use Libre software technology\n* There will be a local designated person that will be in charge of  the project \n  and the know-how transfer to the rest of the community.This person must be \n  committed to be from the beginning of the project until two years after its\n  completion.\n* There must be a commitment of knowledge transfer to the rest of the team.\n\nWe will do our best to help you out with the implementation and training\nfor the local team, to build local capacity and make your project sustainable.\n\nPlease contect us and we'll back to you as soon as possible::\n\n Thank you !\n Dr. Luis Falc√≥n, MD, MSc\n Author and project leader\n falcon@gnuhealth.org\n\n\nEmail\n-----\ninfo@gnuhealth.org\n\nTwitter: @gnuhealth\n\nLicense\n--------\n\nGNU Health, the Libre Digital Health ecosystem, is licensed under GPL v3+::\n\n Copyright (C) 2008-2020 Luis Falcon <falcon@gnuhealth.org>\n Copyright (C) 2011-2020 GNU Solidario <health@gnusolidario.org>\n\n This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n (at your option) any later version.\n\n This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
