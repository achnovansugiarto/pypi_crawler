    "description": "Tool for making tactile maps out of OpenStreetMap data.\n\n# Map of crossing for blind or visually impaired\n\n3D map of single crossing may be an useful aid during teaching blind people how to move through city.\n\nIn this case map is made in a laser cutter from by cutting and engraving plywood and later gluing pieces together to make a map.\n\nThis repository contains code for generating SVG files that can be used to make such map.\n\n# Generation\n## Mapping\nIt is likely that shape of road and footway surfaces is not yet mapped for crossing that is interesting for you.\n\nBut existing editors (especially [Vespucci](https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android) and [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/)) will make data collection much easier that it would be with starting new project from scratch.\n\nThere will be collected set of aerial imagery (on open license), roads itself and nearby buildings may be mapped already. All of that should make things easier than starting from scratch.\n\n![OSM data](images_for_description/01a_OpenStreetMap_data.png)\n\n## Processing data.\n\nCode in this repository downloads and processes from OpenStreetMap areas tagged with `building=*` and `area:highway=*` tags.\n\nIt gives SVG files as an output.\n\n## Laser\n\nLaser cuts and engraves plywood pieces as instructed by generated SVG files.\n\n## Assembly\n\nNow it is time for painting cut pieces (in colours suitable for visually impaired, according to my consultation black for roads and yellow for footways, with zebra pattern for crossings is likely to be a good fit).\n\nAfter that map is ready for final assembly by gluing cut pieces.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nCurrently this software is a work in progress. Not even a single map was made so far, but first prototype should be ready in a near future :)\n\nSee https://github.com/matkoniecz/map-carver/issues for things that are documented as missing.\n\n# Mentions of use are welcome\n\nIn case that you used this code or it inspired you to do something - feel free to create an issue with photo and/or description of what was produced! It would be nice to have confirmation that publishing it was useful for somebody.\n\n# Improving documentation\n\nPlease create a new issue if you want to use it but current instructions are insufficient, wrong or can be in some way improved!\n\nI know that documentation may be far better, but I am not sure what kind of additional documentation would be most useful.\n\n# Sponsors\n\n<a href=\"https://osmfoundation.org/\"><img src=\"logo_osmf.png\" height=\"100\"/></a><br/>\n\nThe [OpenStreetMap foundation](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page) was funding the development of this project in their first round of the [microgrant program](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Microgrants) in 2020. It was done as part of making [tactile maps based on OpenStreetMap data, for blind or visually impaired children](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants_2020/Proposal/Tactile_maps_for_blind_or_visually_impaired_children).\n\nIf anyone else is also interested in supporting this project via funding - [let me know](mailto:osm-messages@etutanota.com) (opening a new issue is also OK) :)\n\n\n",
