    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nThis addon is a base theme for the CMS Plone.\nIt provides a different design and code base for the User Interface.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* mobile first\n* dexterity support only (plone.app.contenttypes)\n* html 5\n* css 3\n* based on foundation (by zurb)\n* use stiky top navigation bar (ala twitter bootstrap)\n* ckeditor 4 wysiwyg\n\nDexterity\n---------\n\nDexterity is the next generation content type engine for the CMS Plone. The\nPlone integration is done by plone.app.contenttypes.\n\nMobile first\n------------\n\nThis theme is mobile first, it means all features are working on a mobile\ndevice and are enhanced for desktop.\n\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement\n\nTo achieve this there is a plonetheme.foundationdesk theme inside this one\nwhere resources are loaded by ajax and triggered by screen with (may change\nin the future)\n\nHTML 5\n------\n\nForms are all based on z3cform and widgets are all HTML5 base widgets using\nthe addon collective.z3cform.html5widgets\n\nIf you want to stay compatible with incapable browser you must consider to\nadd polyfills to your project. For example collective.js.webshims\n\nRead about compatibilities:\n\n* http://mobilehtml5.org/\n* http://www.wufoo.com/html5/\n\nLayout has also been improved by using more semantic HTML tags where it's\npossible.\n\nThis addon remove ...\n---------------------\n\nThis add remove archetypes, so any addons using archetypes will be broken.\n\nremoved skins from portal_skins:\n\n* referencebrowser\n* tinymce\n* archetypes\n* archetypes_kss\n* ATContentTypes\n* plone_ecmascript\n* plone_styles\n* plone_images\n* plone_3rdParty\n* cmf_legacy\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\nRelatedItems support ?\n-----------------------\n\nThe widget at the moment is for desktop and need jqueryui + contenttree\nas javascript depednencies.\n\nOptions we have:\n* do not support related items for mobile and make a widget which is loaded by JS for desktop\n* support it using a simple \"ajax search\" widget without dependencies\n\nfolder_contents\n---------------\n\nTable are not responsive friends. There are many way to display tables on\nmobile but I would prefere not have table at all.\n\nIdeas:\n* treat folder_contents as a mailbox and create a more NUI for this one.\n* use a responsive table approch (which one ?) with as few resources as possible\n\nUpstream some of changes done in this addon\n-------------------------------------------\n\nedit bar and status messages are hard coded in many templates:\n\n* main_template\n* dashboard\n* ...\n\ntheses has been done using viewlet so changing the HTML of theses becomes really easy.\n\n----\n\nStop to wakup image to create an image tag and know your resources:\n\n* logo viewlet\n* prefs_install_products_form\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nCompanies\n---------\n\n|makinacom|_\n\n`Makina Corpus <http://www.makina-corpus.com>`_\n\nPeople\n------\n\n* JeanMichel FRANCOIS [toutpt]\n\n.. |makinacom| image:: http://depot.makina-corpus.org/public/logo.gif\n.. _makinacom:  http://www.makina-corpus.com\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0-dev (unreleased)\n--------------------\n\n- Package created using templer\n  [JeanMichel aka toutpt]",
