    "description": "![Rucksack Logo](doc/img/rucksack_logo.png)\n\n# *A place to store your useful one-liners*\n\n## Overview\n\nRucksack is an interactive command runner that provides useful auto-completion capabilities for those hard to remember one-liners that we all have. It provides a way for you to run your one-liners againt remote systems, complete with any needed arguments (templated out via Jinja2), without having to remember them.\n\nIt was inspired by that `useful_stuff.txt` file that every SysAdmin has on their desktop. You know the one: you come up with a clever one-liner, and you throw it in there so that you can reuse it someday.\n\nRucksack allows you to store your one-liners (and their potential arguments) in a [YAML file](./rucksack.yml.example). You can then connect to a remote host (or localhost) and run those one-liners from one easy place. No more copying and pasting from a `useful_stuff.txt` file!\n\nWant to learn more? Head on over to the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) for more examples and to get started!\n\n![Rucksack Demo](./doc/img/ruck_demo.gif)\n\n**Warning:** Rucksack is a very new project and is under heavy development. Things may change. I think I've got the config file syntax nailed down, but this is still an early project. Please file an issue if you come across a bug.\n\n## Installing\n\nRucksack is available on PyPi and can be installed via `pip`:\n\n```\npip install --user rucksack\n```\n\nThe installation will add the `ruck` command to your path.\n\n## Usage\n\nRucksack has a help page. Simply run `ruck -h` to see all options.\n\nIn general, you simply need to specify `--host ${hostname}` so that Rucksack can connect to a remote host. If you specify `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, Rucksack will not attempt to connect via SSH and will simply shell out local commands.\n\nOnce you launch Rucksack, you will be taken to a prompt. From there, you can run any commands you have defined in your configuration. To quit, simply enter the `quit` command.\n\n## Configuring\n\nRucksack uses a simple YAML configuration file (or multiple YAML files) for its configuration. The easiest way to become acquainted with the configuration file is to try out the [tutorial](./doc/tutorial.md).\n\n### Config File Location\n\nRucksack is configured via one or more YAML files. You can specify a configuration file or directory at the command line, or you can let Rucksack search for one in the following order\n* A `rucksack.yml` or `rucksack.yaml` in the local directory\n* Any `.yml` or `.yaml` files in your home directory at `~/.config/` (e.g., `/home/tony/.config/rucksack/config.yml`)\n* Any `.yml` or `.yaml` files in `/etc/rucksack/` (e.g., `/etc/rucksack/config.yml`)\n* An `/etc/rucksack.yml` or `/etc/rucksack.yaml` file\n\nRucksack will process the above list **in order** and will stop once it has loaded one or more config files from those locations.\n\n### Config File Syntax\n\nThe best way to get up and running with Rucksack configuration is to follow the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md). If you're interested in the logistics of a Rucksack config, then feel free to read on. However, reading the tutorial is **strongly encouraged**, as it will take you through concrete examples.\n\nFor the purposes of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the config file format is the \"public API.\"\n\nThe basic unit of configuration in Rucksack is a YAML dictionary with a `command` key:\n\n```yaml\nget-uptime:\n  command: uptime\n```\n\nThese dictionaries can be nested, which aids in creating more sensible auto-completions:\n\n```yaml\nsystem:\n  basic-info:\n    get-uptime:\n      command: uptime\n```\n\nA command can have 0 or more `args` (arguments), and those arguments can optionally be mandatory. Arguments are rendered using [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).\n\n```yaml\ntail-log:\n  command: \"tail {{ log_file }}\"\n  args:\n    - log_file:\n        mandatory: True\n```\n\nAn argument can specify values to the user, and can even have a default value:\n\n```yaml\ntail-log:\n  command: \"tail {{ log_file }}\"\n  args:\n    - log_file:\n        mandatory: True\n        default: /var/log/syslog\n        values:\n          - /var/log/syslog\n          - /var/log/kern.log\n          - /var/log/auth.log\n```\n\nSometimes, you only want to render an argument if the user specifies a value. For example: you don't want to render a command-line flag if the user didn't provide any value for it. This can be done with an `arg_string` key for the argument. In the example below, the `num_lines` argument only appends `-n {{ num_lines }}` to the command if the user specifies a value for `num_lines`.\n\n```yaml\n  tail-log:\n    command: \"tail {{ log_file }}\"\n    args:\n      - num_lines:\n         arg_string: -n {{ num_lines }}\n      - log_file:\n          mandatory: True\n          default: /var/log/syslog\n          values:\n            - /var/log/syslog\n            - /var/log/kern.log\n            - /var/log/auth.log\n```\n\nFinally, argument values can be dynamically interpolated as the result of other commands. The example below provides a list of `log_file`s for the user to choose from by executing a `find` command in `/var/log/nginx`. Be aware that command output is cached, so this might not be appropriate for values that change often.\n\n```yaml\nnginx:\n  get-top-5-ips:\n    command: \"sudo cat {{ log_file }} 2>/dev/null | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr | head -n 5\"\n    args:\n      - log_file:\n          mandatory: True\n          from_command: \"sudo find /var/log/nginx -name '*access.log*' | grep -v '.gz'\"\n```\n\n# Caveats and Known Issues\n\nThere are currently a few caveats to using Rucksack (please file an issue if you find more):\n\n* Password entry via a `sudo` prompt isn't really supported. It will work, but it won't be pretty. It's expected that the remote user has permissions to execute any commands used by Rucksack (or that they can use passwordless `sudo`).\n* The `from_command` directive is naive, and it will ignore any errors. For example: imagine that the `find` command in the above config is broken. Rucksack will simply ignore this and won't present any values to the user for the auto-completion\n* Config file validation isn't currently implemented, so you may get unexpected results (such as exceptions thrown when exiting) if your config file is broken.\n* Config file parsing, auto-completion, and command rendering almost certainly are not as efficient as they could be (lots of looping over dictionary keys or arrays). Optimizations will come with time.\n* Tests and test logic could use a lot of cleanup and rework\n\n# Credits\n\nThanks to my very talented wife, [Megan Critelli](https://www.instagram.com/fritts.studio/), who designed the Rucksack logo. She does commissions and sells prints.\n\nRucksack stands on the shoulders of some giant projects that made it easy to construct. Special thanks to the following projects for such great Python tools. If you enjoy Rucksack, please consider supporting these projects.\n\n* [Python Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)\n* [Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/)\n\n\n",
