Wait for approval or revision of the new implementations.\n\n## Installation\n\npycity_scheduling requires at least the following Python packages:\n- numpy==1.19.5\n- pandas==1.1.5\n- matplotlib==3.3.4\n- pyomo==5.7.3\n- pycity_base==0.3.2\n- pylint (optional)\n- sphinx (optional)\n- numpydoc (optional)\n- pytest (optional)\n\nas well as the installation of at least one mathematical programming solver for convex and/or non-convex problems, which is supported by the [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) optimisation modelling library.\nWe recommend one of the following solvers:\n\n- [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/)\n- [bonmin](https://github.com/coin-or/Bonmin)\n- [Gurobi (gurobipy)](https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/) (default)\n- [IBM ILOG CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)\n\n\n### Installation of pycity_scheduling\n\nThe latest version of pycity_scheduling is v1.1.0.\n\nIf all the abovementioned dependencies are installed, you should be able to install package pycity_scheduling via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (using Python version >= 3.7) as follows:\n\n`pip install pycity_scheduling`\n\nor to install in editable mode:\n\n`pip install -e '<your_path_to_pycity_scheduling_git_folder>'`\n\nor:\n\n`<path_to_your_python_binary> -m pip install -e '<your_path_to_pycity_scheduling_git_folder>/src'`\n\nThe project can also be installed in editable mode directly from gitlab without the need for a previous download:\n\n`pip install -e \"git+ssh://git.rwth-aachen.de:acs/public/simulation/pycity_scheduling.git\"`\n\nor:\n\n`pip install --src <install_location> -e \"git+ssh://git.rwth-aachen.de:acs/public/simulation/pycity_scheduling.git\"`\n\nYou can check if the installation has been successful by trying to import package pycity_scheduling into your Python environment.\nThis import should be possible without any errors.\n\n`import pycity_scheduling`\n\n\nYou may also try to run the pycity_scheduling's unit tests located in folder ./src/testing using Python module pytest.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for the latest pycity_scheduling release can be found in folder ./docs and on [this](https://acs.pages.rwth-aachen.de/public/simulation/pycity_scheduling/) GitLab page.\n\nFor further information, please also visit the [FEIN Aachen association website](https://fein-aachen.org/en/projects/pycity_scheduling/).\n\n\n## Example usage\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom pycity_scheduling.classes import *\nfrom pycity_scheduling.algorithms import *\nimport pycity_scheduling.util.debug as debug\n\n\n# This is a fundamental tutorial on how to use the pycity_scheduling package.\n\n\ndef main(do_plot=False):\n    print(\"\\n\\n------ Example 00: Fundamentals ------\\n\\n\")\n\n    # 1) Environment objects:\n\n\n    # (Almost) every object within pycity_scheduling requires an environment. The environment object holds general data,\n    # which is valid for all objects within pycity_scheduling, such as time data, weather data or energy market prices.\n    # Therefore, all objects point to an environment. The first step is usually to generate such an environment.\n\n    # Generate a timer object for the environment:\n    timer = Timer(step_size=3600, op_horizon=24, initial_date=(2015, 1, 1), initial_time=(0, 0, 0))\n\n    # Generate a weather object for the environment:\n    weather = Weather(timer=timer)\n\n    # Generate a price object for the environment:\n    price = Prices(timer=timer)\n\n    # Generate the environment object:\n    environment = Environment(timer=timer, weather=weather, prices=price)\n\n\n    # Now there is a distinct environment object with timer, weather and price data.\n    # We can use it to access different data of interest.\n\n    # For example, print the current weekday:\n    print('Weekday:')\n    print(environment.timer.weekday)\n\n    # For example, print the weather forecast for the outdoor temperature (only extract the first 10 timestep values):\n    print('\\nOutdoor temperature forecast:')\n    print(environment.weather.getWeatherForecast(getTAmbient=True)[0][:10])\n\n    # For example, print the energy spot market day-ahead prices:\n    print('\\nDay-ahead spot market prices on 2015/01/01:')\n    print(environment.prices.da_prices)\n\n\n    # 2) Buildings objects:\n\n    # After defining the environment, different building objects should be created. In pycity_scheduling, buildings\n    # represent the different customers of the local energy system / city district under investigation.\n    # In general, buildings should also be understood in a more abstract way. For instance, a building object must not\n    # necessarily represent a building structure, as it would be the case for a wind energy converter.\n\n    # Create a building object:\n    building = Building(environment=environment)\n\n    # This building is assumed to be equipped with a building energy system and one apartment (=single-family house).\n    # In general, every building object can, however, hold up to N different apartments (=multi-family house).\n    apartment = Apartment(environment=environment)\n    bes = BuildingEnergySystem(environment=environment)\n\n    building.addMultipleEntities([apartment, bes])\n\n\n    # Every apartment usually possesses both electrical and thermal loads:\n    # The electrical load is added to the apartment as follows:\n    load = FixedLoad(environment=environment, method=1, annual_demand=3000)\n\n    # Print and show the electrical power curve in Watt:\n    print('\\nElectrical load in Watt:')\n    print(load.get_power(currentValues=False))\n    plt.plot(load.get_power(currentValues=False))\n    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')\n    plt.ylabel('Electrical power in Watt (fixed load)')\n    plt.title('Fixed load power curve')\n    if do_plot:\n        plt.show()\n\n    # The thermal load is added to the apartment as follows:\n    space_heating = SpaceHeating(environment=environment, method=1, living_area=150, specific_demand=100)\n\n    # Print and show space heating power curve in Watt:\n    print('\\nSpace heating power curve in Watt:')\n    print(space_heating.get_power(currentValues=False))\n\n    plt.plot(space_heating.get_power(currentValues=False))\n    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')\n    plt.ylabel('Thermal power in Watt (space heating)')\n    plt.title('Space heating power curve')\n    if do_plot:\n        plt.show()\n\n    apartment.addMultipleEntities([load, space_heating])\n\n\n    # The BuildingEnergySystem (BES) class is a 'container' for all kind of building energy systems (i.e., electrical\n    # and/or thermal assets). For example, we can add an electro-thermal heating system (such as a heatpump plus thermal\n    # energy storage) and a photovoltaic unit to a building's BES as done below. In pycity_scheduling all BES devices\n    # automatically come with basic scheduling models, which include the required Pyomo optimization variables and\n    # several optimization constraints.\n    eh = HeatPump(environment=environment, p_th_nom=16.0)\n    ths = ThermalHeatingStorage(environment=environment, e_th_max=20.0, soc_init=0.5, loss_factor=0)\n    pv = Photovoltaic(environment=environment, method=0, peak_power=8.0)\n\n    bes.addMultipleDevices([eh, ths, pv])\n\n    # Verify if the assets were added successfully (method getHasDevice):\n    print('\\nBES has heatpump? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, heatpump=True)[0])\n    print('BES has thermal heating storage? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, ths=True)[0])\n    print('BES has photovoltaic? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, pv=True)[0])\n\n\n    # 3) CityDistrict objects:\n\n    # In pycity_scheduling, a group of buildings form a CityDistrict object. The CityDistrict is the object to be\n    # \"provided\" to a power scheduling algorithm later on. In other word, it encapsulates all buildings together with\n    # their local assets and it hence includes all the optimization problem information and data.\n\n    # Create a city district object:\n    cd = CityDistrict(environment=environment)\n\n    # Add the building from above to the city district at a certain position/coordinate (x, y).\n    cd.addEntity(entity=building, position=[0, 0])\n\n    # Define and add three other buildings:\n    for i in range(3):\n        heat_demand = SpaceHeating(environment=environment, method=1, living_area=150, specific_demand=100)\n\n        el_load_demand = FixedLoad(environment=environment, method=1, annual_demand=3000)\n\n        pv = Photovoltaic(environment=environment, method=0, peak_power=5.0)\n        bl = Boiler(environment=environment, p_th_nom=24.0)\n\n        ap = Apartment(environment=environment)\n        ap.addEntity(heat_demand)\n        ap.addEntity(el_load_demand)\n\n        bes = BuildingEnergySystem(environment=environment)\n        bes.addDevice(pv)\n        bes.addDevice(bl)\n\n        bd = Building(environment=environment)\n        bd.addEntity(entity=ap)\n        bd.addEntity(entity=bes)\n\n        cd.addEntity(entity=bd, position=[0, i])\n\n    # Print the city district information:\n    print('\\nTotal number of buildings in city district:')\n    print(cd.get_nb_of_building_entities())\n    print(\"\\nDetailed city district information:\")\n    debug.print_district(cd, 3)\n\n\n    # 4) Power scheduling:\n\n    # The final step is to schedule the buildings/assets inside the city district subject to a certain optimization\n    # objective, which can be, for example, peak-shaving. The scheduling is then performed by the user by \"passing\"\n    # the city district object to a certain power scheduling algorithm.\n    # Here, the central optimization algorithm is used.\n\n    # Set the city district / district operator objective and perform the power scheduling using the central\n    # optimization algorithm:\n    cd.set_objective(\"peak-shaving\")\n    opt = CentralOptimization(cd)\n    opt.solve()\n\n    # The scheduling results obtained from the algorithm run can be (temporally) stored as follows:\n    cd.copy_schedule(\"my_central_scheduling\")\n\n    # Print and show the scheduling result (city district power values for every time slot within the defined\n    # optimization horizon):\n    print(\"\\nPower schedule of city district:\")\n    print(list(cd.p_el_schedule))\n\n    plt.plot(cd.p_el_schedule, drawstyle='steps')\n    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')\n    plt.ylabel('Electrical power in Kilowatt')\n    plt.title('Electrical Power Schedule of CityDistrict')\n    if do_plot:\n        plt.show()\n    return\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Run example:\n    main(do_plot=True)\n```\n\n## Tutorial\n\nThe pycity_scheduling package comes with several example/tutorial scripts in folder ./src/examples.\n\nThe unit tests can be found in folder ./src/testing.\n\n\nMoreover, also check the pycity_base package's tutorials for the basic usage of the framework's core functionalities. \n\n\n## License\n\nThe pycity_scheduling package is released by the Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), E.ON Energy Research Center (E.ON ERC), RWTH Aachen University under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n\n## Contact\n\n- Sebastian Schwarz, M.Sc. <sebastian.schwarz@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>\n- Sebastian Alexander Uerlich, B.Sc. <sebastian.uerlich@rwth-aachen.de>\n- Univ.-Prof. Antonello Monti, Ph.D. <post_acs@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>\n\n[Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS)](http://www.acs.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de) \\\n[E.ON Energy Research Center (E.ON ERC)](http://www.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de) \\\n[RWTH Aachen University, Germany](http://www.rwth-aachen.de)\n\n\n<img src=\"https://fein-aachen.org/img/logos/eonerc.png\"/>\n\n\n",
