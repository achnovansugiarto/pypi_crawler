    "description": "# Verso\n\nVerso is an application aimed to simplify and standardize automatic\nversioning in a continuous delivery context.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThe idea with Verso is to reuse part of the functionality needed in\norder to implement Continuous Delivery.\n\nThe approach to continuous delivery taken is the multi-repo approach\ndescribed well in [this\nblog](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/architecting-continuous-delivery).\nThat is, modularization of an application is achieved by breaking out\ncomponents that lives in their own version controlled repositories,\nwith their own delivery pipelines. The components are released to a\nbinary repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus. The dependencies to\nthe components may be resolved at various stages depending on the type\nof component. In the case of a library the dependency typically is\nresolved at build time of the dependent application, by the use of a\ndependency manager, such as Maven, Pip, or Conan. In the case of a\nservice the components are instead resolved at deploy time.\n\nIn order to encourage modularization it is important to reduce the\nfriction involved in creating individual release pipelines for each\ncomponent. Likewise, it is also important to minimize the friction and\nlead time involved by this multi-repo approach; multi-repo approaches\ntypically require multiple changes in order for a fix or feature to\nend up in production. The suggested approach is to automate versioning\nand releases of components, both for staging and trunk (trunk-based\ndevelopment is favored). Releasing for staging means releasing\ncandidates for each proposed change (a proposed change is typically\nsubject to a review, for example pull requests or change\nsets). Releasing for trunk means releasing an approved change.\n\nAutomatic versioning a component can be solved is various ways, but\nthe approach suggested with this project is to use a SemVer-like\napproach. Depending on the ambition of the user, the approach can\npotentially be everything from SemVer to SemVer-like. The reason to\nuse a SemVer-like approach is to let dependency management look\nelegant and conventional. One thing that SemVer for example supports\nis the ability to identify the generation of a component, which\nsimplifies understanding. It can be argued that true SemVer (including\nthe distinction between major, minor, and patch versions), is\nsometimes over-kill for components, at least in small settings, hence\nthe sloppy interpretation of SemVer.\n\n## Design\n\nThe design of this project is not carved in stone. It is not obvious\nwhat to generalize and what to leave to the user to\nspecialize. Different users could have different source code\nmanagement (such as Git, Mercurial or Subversion), different binary\nrepositories (such as Artifactory or Nexus), and different release\nformats (such as Maven, Wheel, Npm, Conan). But one thing is sure, it\nis not advisable to implement the same functionality over and over\nagain for every project that needs to be versioned and released. In\norder to maintain a SemVer-like versioning, the version must be\nincremented, and valid versions must be distinguished from invalid\nones, and that kind of functionality is not trivial.\n\nSince a SemVer-like versioning has an order, the current version must\nsomehow be stored; a state must be maintained. How this state is\nimplemented is a matter of design. One can think of a state maintained\nby a binary repository or some database. In this project the source\ncode management is used. Following the YAGNI design principle, Git\nwill be used, and only Git. Supporting more version control systems\ncould be a future improvement of this project. Using tags of Git is\nactually quite convenient since several birds are killed with one\nstone; tagging revisions that releases are based on is graceful.\n\n## Future improvements\n\nThe current design automatically maintains the patch version while the\nmajor and minor part of the version is more or less permanent. A nice\nimprovement would be to combine the automatic state with a state\nmaintained by writing change log items in a CHANGELOG file. That way\nwe would both have nice release notes and automatic versioning. The\nmajor could for example be identified by the CHANGELOG file, and the\npatch version could be automatically maintained. Using this approach\nwould actually allow users to maintain a pure SemVer versioning by\nallowing users to write change logs for major and minors, while still\nuse an automated versioning for patch versions.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name `Verso` is the result of playing with the word `version`, the\nliteral meaning of the Italian word `verso` meaning `towards` in\nEnglish.\n\n## Installation (from PyPI)\n\n    pip install verso\n\n## Usage (after installation from PyPI)\n\nGet the current version of the Git project of the current directory:\n\n    verso current-version\n\nThe command will go through all git tags of the format vX.Y.Z in the\nproject, order them, and print the latest, without the prefix.\n\nGet the next version of the Git project of the current directory:\n\n    verso next-version\n\nThe command will go through all git tags of the format vX.Y.Z in the\nproject, order them, and print the latest but with the patch version\nincreased by one.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome. All functionality must be covered by tests.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIn order to test application locally Docker and Make must be\ninstalled.\n\n## How to test application\n\nTesting of Verso makes use of Make as a task runner. The following\ncommand runs all tests.\n\n    make test\n\n## How to create a package\n\n    VERSION=X.Y.Z make package\n\nThe package will end up in a folder named `dist`.\n\n## How to release application\n\n    VERSION=X.Y.Z make upload-test\n    VERSION=X.Y.Z make upload-prod\n\n\n",
