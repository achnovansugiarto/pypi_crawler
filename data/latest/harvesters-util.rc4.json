Technically speaking, Harvester is a Python library which is responsible for the following tasks:\n\n* Image acquisition\n* Device manipulation\n* Image data visualization (optional)\n\nHarvester consumes image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. If you have an officially certified GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, then Harvester supplies you the acquired image data as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ array to make your image processing task productive.\n\nYou can freely use, modify, distribute Harvester under `Apache License-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ without worrying about the use of your software: personal, internal or commercial.\n\nCurrently, Harvester is being developed by the motivated contributors from all over the world.\n\n***********************\nWhere is the name from?\n***********************\n\nHarvester's name was coming from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called \"The Harvesters\". Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.\n\nApart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)\n\n.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/40595190-1e16e90e-626e-11e8-9dc7-207d691c6d6d.jpg\n    :align: center\n    :alt: The Harvesters\n\n    Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Harvesters, 1565, (c) 2000â€“2018 The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n****************\nAsking questions\n****************\n\nWe have prepared a chat room in Gitter.

We will add your company/organization name to the list.\n\n***************\nGenTL Producers\n***************\n\nAs of today, we have tested Harvester with the following GenTL Producers and it definitely is the shortest way to get one from the following list to get Harvester working with tangible machine vision cameras:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n    :align: center\n\n    - - Company Name\n      - SDK Name\n      - Camera Manufacture Free\n    - - Baumer Optronic\n      - `Baumer GAPI SDK <https://www.baumer.com/ae/en/product-overview/image-processing-identification/software/baumer-gapi-sdk/c/14174>`_\n      - No\n    - - DAHENG VISION\n      - `MER Galaxy View <http://en.daheng-image.com/products_list/&pmcId=a1dda1e7-5d40-4538-9572-f4234be49c9c.html>`_\n      - No\n    - - JAI\n      - `JAI SDK <https://www.jai.com/support-software/jai-software>`_\n      - Yes\n    - - Matrix Vision\n      - `mvIMPACT_Acquire <http://static.matrix-vision.com/mvIMPACT_Acquire/>`_\n      - Yes\n    - - OMRON SENTECH\n      - `StCamUSBPack <https://sentech.co.jp/data/#cnt2nd>`_\n      - No\n    - - STEMMER IMAGING\n      - `Common Vision Blox <https://www.commonvisionblox.com/en/cvb-download/>`_\n      - Yes\n\nYou might be able to directly download one at their website but please note that perhaps some of them could require you to register your information to get one. In addition, some GenTL Producers might block you to connect other competitors' cameras.\n\n###########\nTerminology\n###########\n\nBefore start talking about the detail, let's take a look at some important terminologies that frequently appear in this document. These terminologies are listed as follows:\n\n* **The GenApi-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with the GenICam reference implementation.\n\n* **A GenTL Producer**: A library that has C interface and offers consumers a way to communicate with cameras over physical transport layer dependent technology hiding the detail from the consumer.\n\n* **The GenTL-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with GenTL Producers.\n\n* **Harvester**: A Python module that consists of Harvester Core and Harvester GUI.\n\n* **Harvester Core**: A part of Harvester that works as an image acquisition engine.\n\n* **Harvester GUI**: A part of Harvester that works as a graphical user interface of Harvester Core.\n\n* **A GenICam compliant device**: It's typically a camera. Just involving the GenICam reference implementation, it offers consumers a way to dynamically configure/control the target devices.\n\nThe following diagram shows the hierarchy and relationship of the relevant modules:\n\n.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/44316633-926cf100-a467-11e8-92c6-ac69ad3c8129.png\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Module hierarchy\n\n############\nInstallation\n############\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to instruct procedures to get Harvester work.\n\n*******************\nSystem Requirements\n*******************\n\nThe following software modules are required to get Harvester working:\n\n* Either of Python 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6\n\nIn addition, you will need the following items to let Harvester make something meaningful:\n\n* GenTL Producers\n* GenICam compliant machine vision cameras\n\n***************************\nSupported operating systems\n***************************\n\nHarvester has been tested with the following operating systems:\n\n* macOS 10.13\n* Ubuntu 14.04\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 7.4\n* Windows 7\n\n*************************\nInstalling Harvester Core\n*************************\n\nYou can install Harvester via PyPI invoking the following command; note that the package name is ``harvesters`` but not ``harvester``; unfortunately, the latter word had been reserved:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install harvesters\n\nFor people who those have already installed it:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install --upgrade harvesters\n\nPerhaps ``pip`` could install cached package. If you want to install the newly dowloaded package, you should invoke the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install harvesters --no-cache-dir\n\nThese commands will automatically install the required modules such as ``numpy`` or ``genicam2`` (the Python Binding for the GenICam GenApi & the GenTL Producers) if the module has not yet installed on your environment.\n\nGetting back to the original topic, you could install the latest development version it using ``setup.py`` cloning Harvester from GitHub:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/genicam/harvesters.git && cd harvesters && python setup.py install\n\n************************\nInstalling Harvester GUI\n************************\n\nIf you want to use Harvester GUI, then please additionally install the following modules. Note that ``PyQt`` is provided under LGPL and it may not be ideal for your purpose:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install PyQt5 vispy\n\nIn the future, we might support other GUI frameworks which are more or less open and free.\n\n***********************\nLaunching Harvester GUI\n***********************\n\nTo launch Harvester GUI, let's create a Python script file, naming ``harvester.py``, that contains the following code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import sys\n    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication\n    from harvesters.frontend.pyqt5 import Harvester\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n        h = Harvester()\n        h.show()\n        sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\nThen launch ``harvester.py``:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ python path/to/harvester.py\n\nYou will see Harvester GUI pops up.\n\n###########################\nHow does Harvester help us?\n###########################\n\nHarvester mainly consists of the following two Python modules:\n\n* **Harvester Core**: An image acquisition engine\n* **Harvester GUI**: Graphical user interface between users & Harvester Core\n\nIn this section, we will learn what Harvester offers us through these components.\n\n**************\nHarvester Core\n**************\n\nHarvester Core is an image acquisition engine. No GUI. You can use it as an image acquisition library which acquires images from GenTL Producers through the GenTL-Python Binding and controls the target device (it's typically a camera) through the GenApi-Python Binding.\n\nHarvester Core works as a minimalistic front-end for image acquisition. Just importing it from your Python script, you should immediately be able to set images on your table.\n\nYou'll be able to download the these language binding runtime libraries from the `EMVA website <https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam/genicam-downloads/>`_, however, it's not available as of May 2018, because they have not officially released yet. Fortunately they are in the final reviewing process so hopefully they'll be released by the end of 2018.\n\nIf you don't have to care about the display rate for visualizing acquired images, the combination of Harvester Core and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ might be a realistic option for that purpose.\n\nTasks Harvester Core does for you\n=================================\n\nThe main features of Harvester Core are listed as follows:\n\n* Image acquisition through GenTL Producers\n* Multiple loading of GenTL Producers in a single Python script\n* GenICam feature node manipulation of the target device\n\nNote that the second item implies you can involve multiple types of transport layers in your Python script. Each transport layer has own advantages and disadvantages and you should choose appropriate transport layers following your application's requirement. You just need to acquire images for some purposes and the GenTL Producers deliver the images somehow. It truly is the great benefit of the GenTL Standard! And of course, not only GenTL Producers but Harvester Core offer you a way to manipulate multiple devices in a single Python script with an intuitive manner.\n\nOn the other hand, Harvester Core could be considered as a simplified version of the GenTL-Python Binding; actually, Harvester Core hides it in its back and shows only intuitive interfaces to its clients. Harvester Core just offers you a relationship between you and a device. Nothing more. We say it again, just you and a device. If you need to manipulate more relevant GenTL modules or have to achieve something over a hardcore way, then you should directly work with the GenTL-Python Binding.\n\nPixel formats that Harvester Core supports\n==========================================\n\nCurrently, Harvester Core supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:\n\n    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``\n\n*************\nHarvester GUI\n*************\n\nHarvester GUI works on the top of Harvester Core and offers you high-performance image data visualization on the fly. It involves VisPy for controlling OpenGL functionality and PyQt for providing GUI.\n\nTasks Harvester GUI does for you\n================================\n\nThe main features of Harvester GUI are listed as follows:\n\n* Image data visualization of the acquired images\n* Image magnification using a mouse wheel or a trackpad\n* Image dragging using a mouse or a trackpad\n* An arbitrary selection of image displaying point in the data path (Not implemented yet)\n\nUnlike Harvester Core, Harvester GUI limits the number of GenTL Producers to load just one. This is just a limitation to not make the GUI complicated. In general, the user should know which GenTL Producer should be loaded to control his target device. It's not necessary to load multiple GenTL Producers for this use case. However, this is just an idea in an early stage. We might support multiple loading on even Harvester GUI in the future.\n\nPixel formats that Harvester GUI supports\n=========================================\n\nCurrently, Harvester GUI supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:\n\n    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``\n\nNote that Harvester GUI has not yet supported demosaicing.\n\n###########\nScreenshots\n###########\n\nIn this section, we see some useful windows which Harvester offers you.\n\n****************************\nImage data visualizer window\n****************************\n\nThe image data visualizer window (below) offers you a visualization of the acquired images. In this screenshot, Harvester is acquiring a 4000 x 3000 pixel of RGB8 image at 30 fps; it means it's acquiring images at 8.6 Gbps. It's quite fast, isn't it?\n\n.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/43035346-c84fe404-8d28-11e8-815f-2df66cbbc6d0.png\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Image data visualizer\n\n***************************\nAttribute controller window\n***************************\n\nThe attribute controller window (below) offers you to manipulate GenICam feature nodes of the target device. Changing exposure time, triggering the target device for image acquisition, storing a set of camera configuration so-called User Set, etc, you can manually control the target device anytime when you want to. It supports the visibility filter feature and regular expression feature. These features are useful in a case where you need to display only the features you are interested in.\n\n.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/43035351-d35a2936-8d28-11e8-83d5-7b6efa6e2ad8.png\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Attribute Controller\n\n*************************\nHarvester Core on IPython\n*************************\n\nThe following screenshot shows Harvester Core is running on IPython. Harvester Core returns the latest image data at the moment as a Numpy array every time its user call the ``get_image()`` method. Once you get an image you should be able to immediately start image processing. If you're running on the Jupyter notebook, you should be able to visualize the image data using Matplotlib. This step should be helpful to check what's going on your trial in the image processing flow.\n\n.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/44914082-15485280-ad6a-11e8-85a5-9d0632aef28f.png\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Harvester on IPython\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    In [1]: from harvesters.core import Harvester\n\n    In [2]: import numpy as np\n\n    In [3]: h = Harvester()\n\n    In [4]: h.add_cti_file('/Users/kznr/dev/genicam/bin/Maci64_x64/TLSimu.cti')\n\n    In [5]: h.update_device_info_list()\n\n    In [6]: h.device_info_list\n    Out[6]:\n    [(id_='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0', version='1.2.3'),\n     (id_='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_1', version='1.2.3'),\n     (id_='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_0', version='1.2.3'),\n     (id_='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_1', version='1.2.3')]\n\n    In [7]: iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0')\n\n    In [8]: iam.device.node_map.Width.value, iam.device.node_map.Height.value = 8, 8\n\n    In [9]: iam.device.node_map.PixelFormat.value = 'Mono8'\n\n    In [10]: iam.start_image_acquisition()\n\n    In [11]: buffer = iam.fetch_buffer()\n\n    In [12]: type(buffer)\n    Out[12]: harvesters.core.Buffer\n\n    In [13]: type(buffer.payload)\n    Out[13]: harvesters.core.PayloadImage\n\n    In [14]: len(buffer.payload.components)\n    Out[14]: 1\n\n    In [15]: type(buffer.payload.components[0])\n    Out[15]: harvesters.core.Component2D\n\n    In [16]: type(buffer.payload.components[0].data)\n    Out[16]: numpy.ndarray\n\n    In [17]: buffer.payload.components[0].data\n    Out[17]:\n    array([[153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160],\n           [154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161],\n           [155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162],\n           [156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163],\n           [157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164],\n           [158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165],\n           [159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166],\n           [160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167]], dtype=uint8)\n\n    In [18]: buffer.queue()\n\n    In [19]: with iam.fetch_buffer() as buffer:\n        ...:     image = buffer.payload.components[0].data\n        ...:     print('Average: {0}'.format(np.average(image)))\n        ...:     print(image)\n        ...:\n    Average: 218.0\n    [[211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218]\n     [212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219]\n     [213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220]\n     [214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221]\n     [215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222]\n     [216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223]\n     [217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224]\n     [218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225]]\n\n    In [20]: iam.stop_image_acquisition()\n\n    In [21]: iam.destroy()\n\n###############\nUsing Harvester\n###############\n\n********************\nUsing Harvester Core\n********************\n\nFirst, let's import Harvester:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from harvesters.core import Harvester\n\nThen instantiate a Harvester object; we're going to use ``h`` that stands for\nHarvester as its identifier.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h = Harvester()\n\nAnd load a CTI file; loading a CTI file, you can communicate with the GenTL\nProducer:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.add_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')\n\nNote that you can add **one or more CTI files** on a single Harvester Core object. To add another CTI file, just repeat calling ``add_cti_file`` method passing another target CTI file:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.add_cti_file('path/to/another_gentl_producer.cti')\n\nAnd the following code will let you know the CTI files that have been loaded\non the Harvester object:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.cti_files\n\nIn a contrary sense, you can remove a specific CTI file that you have added with the following code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.remove_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')\n\nAnd now yol have to update the list of devices; it fills up your device\ninformation list and you'll select a device to control from the list:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.update_device_info_list()\n\nThe following code will let you know the devices that you can control:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    h.device_info_list\n\nOur friendly GenTL Producer, so called TLSimu, gives you the following information:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    [(unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0', version='1.2.3'),\n     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_1', version='1.2.3'),\n     (unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_0', version='1.2.3'),\n     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_1', version='1.2.3')]\n\nAnd you create an image acquisition manager object specifying a target device. The image acquisition manager does the image acquisition task for you. In the following example it's trying to create an manager object of the first candidate device in the device information list:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(0)\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(list_index=0)\n\nYou can connect the same device passing more unique information to the method such as:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    mono_a = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0')\n\nWe named the manager object ``iam`` in the above example but in a practical occasion, you may name it like just ``camera``, ``mono_cam``, or ``face_detection_cam`` more specifically even though those entities don't acquire images by themselves but they transfer images that will be acquired by their image acquisition manager.\n\nAnyway, then now we start image acquisition:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    iam.start_image_acquisition()\n\nOnce you started image acquisition, you should definitely want to get an image. An image is delivered to a buffer manager object. To fetch a buffer that has been filled up with an image, you can have 2 options; the first option is to use the ``with`` statement:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    with iam.fetch_buffer() as buffer:\n        # Work with the Buffer object. It consists of everything you need.\n        print(buffer)\n        # The buffer will automatically be queued.\n\nHaving that code, the fetched buffer is automatically queued once the code step out from the scope of the ``with`` statement. It's prevents you to forget queueing it by accident. The other option is to manually queue the fetched buffer by yourself:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    buffer = iam.fetch_buffer()\n    print(buffer)\n    # Don't forget to queue the buffer.\n    buffer.queue()\n\nIn this option, again, please do not forget that you have to queue the buffer by yourself. If you forget queueing it, then you'll lose a buffer that could be used for image acquisition. Everything is up to your design, so please choose an appropriate way for you. In addition, once you queued the buffer, the Buffer object will be obsolete. There's nothing to do with it.\n\nOkay, then you would stop image acquisition with the following code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    iam.stop_image_acquisition()\n\nAnd the following code disconnects the connecting device from the image acquisition manager; you'll have to create an image acquisition manager object again when you have to work with a device:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    iam.destroy()\n\nNow you can quit the program! Please not that the image acquisition manager also supports the ``with`` statement. So you may write program as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    with h.create_image_acquisition_manager(0) as iam:\n        # Work, work, and work with the iam object.\n\n    # the iam object will automatically call the destroy method.\n\n*******************\nUsing Harvester GUI\n*******************\n\nHarvester GUI :: Image data visualizer window\n=============================================\n\nImage data visualizer window :: Toolbar\n---------------------------------------\n\nMost of Harvester GUI's features can be used through its toolbox.

During the Frankfurt IVSM, interested engineers tried out Harvester and confirmed it really worked using commercial machine vision cameras provided by well-known machine vision camera manufacturers in the world. Having that fact, the attendees of the IVSM warmly welcomed Harvester.\n\nThe following individuals have directly or indirectly contributed to the development activity of Harvester or encouraged the developers by their thoughtful warm words; they are our respectable wonderful colleagues:\n\nRod Barman, Stefan Battmer, David Beek, Jan Becvar, David Bernecker, Chris Beynon, Eric Bourbonnais, Benedikt Busch, George Chamberlain, Thomas Detjen, Friedrich Dierks, Dana Diezemann, Emile Dodin, Reynold Dodson, Sascha Dorenbeck, Erik Eloff, Katie Ensign, Andreas Ertl, James Falconer, Werner Feith, Maciej Gara, Andreas Gau, Sebastien Gendreau, Francois Gobeil, Werner Goeman, Jean-Paul Goglio, Markus Grebing, Eric Gross, Ioannis Hadjicharalambous, Uwe Hagmaier, Tim Handschack, Christopher Hartmann, Reinhard Heister, Gerhard Helfrich, Jochem Herrmann, Heiko Hirschmueller, Tom Hopfner, David Hoese, Karsten Ingeman Christensen, Severi Jaaskelainen, Mattias Johannesson, Mark Jones, Mattias Josefsson, Martin Kersting, Stephan Kieneke, Tom Kirchner, Lutz Koschorreck, Frank Krehl, Maarten Kuijk, Max Larin, Ralf Lay, Min Liu, Sergey Loginonvskikh, Thomas Lueck, Alain Marchand, Rocco Matano, Masahide Matsubara, Stephane Maurice, Robert McCurrach, Mike Miethig, Thies Moeller, Roman Moie, Marcel Naggatz, Hartmut Nebelung, Damian Nesbitt, Quang Nhan Nguyen, Klaus-Henning Noffz, Neerav Patel, Jan Pech, Merlin Plock, Joerg Preckwinkel, Benjamin Pussacq, Dave Reaves, Thomas Reuter, Andreas Rittinger, Ryan Robe, Nicolas P.
