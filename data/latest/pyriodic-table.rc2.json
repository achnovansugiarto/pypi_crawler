    "description": "# --- pyriodic_table ---\n\n`pyriodic_table` is a simple Python package which aims to achieve the following:\n\n- Provide *insightful* data (as accurate as possible) on the 118 chemical elements discovered to date,\nstarting with **hydrogen**, all the way to the super-heavy **oganesson**!\n- Make this data easily accessible, in an organised manner.\n- Allow easy identification of elements to access their data, through multiple methods.\n- Be user-friendly and easy to use.\n\nThe PyPi page for the package is:\nhttps://pypi.org/project/pyriodic-table/\n\n## About the data\n\nVarious data points are provided for each element.\n\n### Data Categories\n\n#### Name\n\nThis is simply what the element is called, and is self-explanatory.\n\nFor example, the first element is called hydrogen.\n\n#### Symbol\n\nThis is the abbrevation for an element, consisting of one or two Latin letters, and\nstarting with a capital letter. It is much more convenient than having to refer\nto an element's name.\n\nFor example, the symbol for hydrogen is '**H**', and the symbol\nfor gold is '**Au**' (*aurum*).\n\nAs in the example of gold, element symbols can be misleading and not so obvious as to which element they represent.\n\n#### Atomic number\n\nThis is just the number of protons in an atom's nucleus (which also happens to be\nthe number of electrons in an atom's shells - to cancel out the positive charge of the\nprotons). In addition, the atomic number indicates the nth element.\n\nFor example, hydrogen has an atomic number of **1** and is the **1**st element. And oganesson has an atomic number\nof **118** and is the **118**th element.\n\n#### Atomic mass\n\nThis is how heavy on average an atom of an element is, compared to the carbon-12 isotope,\nwhich has an atomic mass of exactly 12. For example, if element X has an isotope with mass\nnumber of 25 (50% of element X), and an isotope with mass number of 27 (50% of element X),\nelement X would have an atomic mass of 26. If an element has no stable isotopes, the mass\nnumber of its longest-lived isotope is considered to be its atomic mass.\n\nFor example, hydrogen has an atomic mass of **1.008**, and astatine, the rarest natural element,\nhas an atomic mass of **210** (astatine-210 has the longest half life of all astatine\nradioisotopes).\n\n#### Electrons per shell\n\nThis is the number of electrons in each energy level of an atom.\nFor example, hydrogen has only one electron and thus only 1 shell: **(1,)**.\nBut potassium has 19 electrons: **(2, 8, 8, 1)**.\n\n#### State\n\nThis refers to what form the matter of an element takes at room temperature, either\n*solid*, *liquid* or *gas*.\n\nFor example, oxygen is obviously a **gas** at room temperature, and\nequally unsurprisingly, iron is a **solid** at room temperature.\n\nSurprisingly, only two elements are liquids at room temperature: bromine and mercury.\n\n#### Group\n\nA group in the periodic table is a vertical column of elements. Most elements belong in a group,\nbut some elements, including certain lanthanides (e.g lanthanum), are not put into one.\nSome groups also have special names, including:\n\n- Group 1 - **alkali metals** (e.g sodium) [Be careful, hydrogen is also in group 1 but certainly is not a metal.]\n- Group 2 - **alkaline earth metals** (e.g calcium)\n- Group 17 - **halogens** (e.g iodine)\n- Group 18 - **noble gases** (e.g helium)\n\n#### Period\n\nA period is a horizontal row of elements. For example, hydrogen is in period **1** and\ncopper is in period **4**.\n\n#### Melting point\n\nThis is the temperature at which an element turns from a solid into a liquid. It varies\nsignificantly over different elements. The three temperature units: *Kelvin (K)*,\n*Celsius (°C)* and *Fahrenheit (°F)* are all supported.\n\nFor example, hydrogen has a melting point of **13.99 K / -259.16 °C / -434.488 °F**;\nand titanium has a melting point of **1941 K / 1667.85 °C / 3034.13 °F**.\n\n#### Boiling point\n\nThis is the temperature at which an element turns from a liquid into a gas. It varies\nsignificantly over different elements. Like melting point, all three temperature\nunits are supported.\n\nFor example, hydrogen has a boiling point of **20.271 K / -252.897 °C / -423.1822 °F**;\nand titanium has a boiling point of **3560 K / 3286.86 °C / 5948.33 °F**.\n\n#### Density\n\nThis is the mass per unit volume of an element at room temperature. Gases have an\nextremely low density compared to solids and liquids. The unit used by all elements\nis nonetheless g/cm³.\n\nFor example, hydrogen has a density of only **0.00008988 g/cm³**, whilst\nosmium has a whopping density of **22.59 g/cm³**.\n\n#### Natural?\n\nThis refers to whether or not an element can be found naturally and is not synthetic (man-made). As long as an element exists in extremely trace quantities, it counts as natural, so this includes technetium and promethium!\n\nFor example, carbon is certainly found naturally,\nwhilst americium is synthetic.\n\n#### Has stable isotope?\n\nThis refers to whether or not an element can be stable. If an element does not have at least one stable isotope, it is radioactive. Note that elements which have at least have one stable isotope certainly can also have several radioisotopes.\n\nFor example, tin has many stable isotopes, whilst uranium is radioactive.\n\n#### Discovery\n\nThis refers to the person/people or place(s) that first found the element, either through\nnature or synthetically.\n\nFor example, **Henry Cavendish** discovered hydrogen, but **Riken** (a large scientific\nresearch institute in Japan) discovered nihonium.\n\n#### Discovery year\n\nSelf-explanatory! This refers to the year of element discovery.\nFor example, hydrogen was discovered in **1766** (by Cavendish),\nand nihonium was discovered relatively recently - in **2004**.\n\n### Data accuracy, completeness and reliability\n\nElement data has been manually obtained and entered carefully, from various sources, including:\n- *Wikipedia* pages for each element.\n- *Royal Society of Chemistry* - https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table\n\nUnfortunately, many elements have missing data, such as melting/boiling points and density.\nFurthermore, particular data for certain elements may be inaccurate.\n\nNonetheless, the common elements likely have high-quality accurate data, and conveniently, they are the\nmost used. For example, unsurprisingly oxygen, an abundant element we need for respiration\nis much better known than livermorium, a synthetic, radioactive, short-lived element of which\nonly a few atoms have been produced.\n\n## Compatability\n\nPython 3.9 or greater is supported.\n",
