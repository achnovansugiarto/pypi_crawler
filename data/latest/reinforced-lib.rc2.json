The library can serve as a simple solution with ready to use RL workflows as well as\nan expandable framework with programmable behaviour. Thanks to the functional implementation of the library's core,\nwe can provide full access to the JAX's jit functionality, which boosts the agent's performance significantly.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the latest released version of Reinforced-lib from PyPI via:\n\n```bash\npip install reinforced-lib\n```\n\nYou can also download source code and install the development dependencies if you want to build the documentation locally:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:m-wojnar/reinforced-lib.git\ncd reinforced-lib\npip3 install \".[dev]\"\n```\n\n## Example code\n\n```python\nfrom reinforced_lib import RLib\nfrom reinforced_lib.agents import ThompsonSampling\nfrom reinforced_lib.exts import IEEE_802_11_ax\n\nimport gym\n\n\nrlib = RLib(\n  agent_type=ThompsonSampling,\n  ext_type=IEEE_802_11_ax\n)\n\nenv = gym.make('WifiSimulator-v1')\nenv_state, _ = env.reset()\n\nterminated = False\nwhile not terminated:\n  action = rlib.sample(**env_state)\n  env_state, reward, terminated, *_ = env.step(action)\n```\n\n## Integrated IEEE 802.11ax support\n\nLibrary design is distinctly influenced by the desire to support research in Wi-Fi. It can be a tool for researchers \nto optimize the Wi-Fi protocols with built-in RL algorithms and provided IEEE 802.11ax environment extension.\n\nWe also provide simple [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) simulation and RL-based rate adaptation manager for the \nIEEE 802.11ax standard in [examples](https://github.com/m-wojnar/reinforced-lib/tree/main/examples/ns-3).\n\n## Modular architecture\n\n**Reinforced-lib** can be well characterized by it's modular architecture which makes the library flexible, universal,\nand easy-to-use. Its key parts are placed in separate modules and connected in a standardized way to provide versatility\nand the possibility to extend individual modules in the future. Nevertheless, Reinforced-lib is a single piece of software\nthat can be easily used, thanks to the topmost module, which ensures a simple and common interface for all agents.\n\n<img src=\"docs/resources/architecture.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n\n### The API module\n\nThe API module is the top layer of the library; it exposes a simple and intuitive interface that makes the library easy\nto use. There are several important methods, one of them is responsible for creating a new agent. Another takes the\nobservations from the environment as input, updates the state of the agent, and returns the next action proposed by the agent.\nThe last two methods are used to persist the state of the agent by storing it in memory.\n\n### The extensions module\n\nThe Extensions module consists of containers with domain-specific knowledge and ensures the proper use of universal agents\nimplemented in **Reinforced-lib**. If a specific problem is implemented in the form of an extension, the module infers and\nprovides the appropriate data to the agent, and at the same time requires adequate, corresponding values from the user.\n\n### The agents module\n\nThe Agents module is a collection of universal algorithms, which are called \"agents\" in RL community. Each agent has\na similar API to communicate with the Extensions module, which ensures its versatility and expandability. In this release\nof **Reinforced-lib** we focused on the [multi-armed bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit),\nhence the imlemented agents are related to this task.\n\n### The logging module\n\nThe Logging module is responsible for collecting data from other modules and observing their state in real time.\nIt also has great potential in using the library to create new RL agents - it can be used to develop, evaluate,\nand debug new agents by observing decisions they make; record and visualize how environment state changes in time;\nor provide a simple way to obtain a training summary, metrics, and logs.\n\n## Citing Reinforced-lib\n\nTo cite this repository:\n\n```\n@software{reinforcedlib2022,\n  author = {Maksymilian Wojnar and Wojciech Ciężobka},\n  title = {{R}einforced-lib: {R}einforcement learning library},\n  url = {http://github.com/m-wojnar/reinforced-lib},\n  year = {2022},\n}\n```\n",
