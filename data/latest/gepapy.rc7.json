Since docker is cross-platform so it works on a wide range of operating systems and it is enough to refer to the following nvidia repository https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker and follow the instructions, then the image can be modified to install python and their respective libraries, as well as a jupyter server if you want to use it from a notebook https://docs.docker.com/. Another alternative is to install an environment with ANCONDA that supports cuda https://www.anaconda.com/. After configuring the environment with support for cuda, just run the following commands to install the library automatically from the pypi repositories.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n  # Si ya se encuentran instaladas las librerias, typing, numpy, cupy,  y numba y configurado el ambiente para cuda\n  pip install gepapy --no-deps \n\n\n  # Si no se encuentran instalada alguna de las librerias, typing, numpy, cupy,  y numba\n  pip install gepapy \n\n\n\n  # si se quieren visualizar graficos de Gantt\n  pip install chart_studio\n  \nExamples\n------------------------\n\nSingle Machine\n\nThe ** single machine ** problem is a scheduling case in which there is only one machine and a number of operations greater than one that must be performed on it, so the objective is to optimize the order of execution of did many operations based on priority weights assigned to each machine and expected delivery times.\n\n\nThe following code can be divided into 4 parts:\n\n\n> * ** Import of libraries. **\n> * ** Import or definition of the problem data. **\n> * ** Instantiation of the SingleMachine class object. **\n> * ** Definition of the loop that will be repeated over each epoch. **\n\n\n** Import of libraries. **\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import time \n  from gegapy.single_machine import Single_Machine\n  import cupy as cp\n  import numpy as np\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nThe time library is only to measure the execution time, so it is not strictly necessary to use it, the gen_scheduling_cuda library contains the different classes that allow us to create objects for the different types of problems that are supported in the library, for example in this case SingleMachine , FlowShop and JobShop. It should be said that Single Machine and FlowShop are specific cases of JobShop, therefore the JobShop type objects can also solve this type of more specific problems, but the user must make the respective modifications in the input data manually, so for ease of use You can create SingleMachine and FlowShop objects and thus not have to worry about the adequacy of the problem. In general, the JobShop type objects implemented in the library can be used to solve any problem that is encoded as sequences of repeated numbers, for example [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2 , 4, 4]\n\nThe cupy library is an extension of numpy for nvidia GPUs and it is necessary to import it since it allows the handling of all kinds of arrays that are stored in the GPU memory, in turn it is also necessary to import numpy to use these arrays when they are require passing to the CPU memory, either to view them, to save them or to use them in another library that does not have GPU support.\n\nFinally we import the matplotlib library to be able to make graphs and visualize the optimization curve.\n\n** Import or definition of the problem data. **\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  T_ = cp.array([10,10,13,4,9,4,8,15,7,1,9,3,15,9,11,6,5,14,18,3],dtype=cp.float32)\n  d_ = cp.array([50,38,49,12,20,105,73,45,6,64,15,6,92,43,78,21,15,50,150,99],dtype=cp.float32)\n  w_ = cp.array([10,5,1,5,10,1,5,10,5,1,5,10,10,5,1,10,5,5,1,5],dtype=cp.float32)\n\nFor this specific  Single Machine  problem, the following data must be defined to solve the problem; T, d, w. Each position in the vector represents an operation, so T [0] -> 10 says that the zero operation time is 10, then d [0] -> 50, says that the expected delivery time for the zero operation is 50 and W [0] -> 10, says that the delivery priority for the zero operation is 1/10, so then the problem conditions are defined.\n\n\n** SingleMachine class object instantiation. **\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  p = Single_Machine(n_samples=100000,\n                     n_jobs=20,\n                     processing_time=T_,\n                     due_date=d_,\n                     weights=w_,\n                     percent_cross=0.8,\n                     percent_mutation=0.8,\n                     percent_migration=0.1,\n                     fitness_type=\"E_LTw\")\n\n\nThe instantiation of an object is the way to obtain a set of tools to solve the problem associated with said object, once it is created and initialized with the parameters of the problem, then the different compatible operations can be applied, in terms of the Some initialization parameters can be modified afterwards at any moment of the execution and others cannot, among which they can be changed are, for example, the percentages of crossing, mutation and migration, probation size, fitness and a few more. Actually, in this example, not all the possible parameters of a SingleMachine type problem are presented, since they were not necessary for this case, but these will be exposed in the complete documentation of the library.\n\n\n\n** Definition of the loop that will be repeated over each epoch. **\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  fitness = []\n  fitness2 = []\n\n  start_time = time.time()\n\n  for i in range(100):\n      p.exec_crossA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001()\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      fitness2.append(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      p.exec_mutationA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      fitness2.append(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      p.exec_migrationA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      fitness2.append(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      fitness.append(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      print(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      print(p.get_population()[0])\n\n\nThis loop can be built according to the wishes of the user and the order that he considers pertinent, within the loop at any time he can decide to change any of the object's parameters or even if he has sufficient expertise to modify the population at some point with another code tool or library, tie everything and then continue with the training. For the specific example, a crossing was defined to be made in each epoch, then the fitness is calculated, then the population is rearranged according to the fitness, then a mutation, then again the fitness and the rearrangement and finally a migration and a redenomination and so on. 100 generations or epochs.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  plt.plot(fitness)\n  \n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandalarotation/gepapy/master/assets/smp_fitness.png\n\n\nJob Shop Problem\n\nThe JobShop problem is somewhat more general and interesting than the SingleMachine case, here it is necessary to optimize the order of execution of several jobs, several operations and several machines, for which we have certain restrictions of presence and concurrence in the execution of certain operations on certain machines, which are represented by a pair of matrices, one that defines the execution times in each machine-job combination and a third that defines the order in which each job must be executed in the different machines for each respective operation. There may be several optimization criteria and the library supports several that will be explained in the complete documentation, however for this example we will use the criterion of minimizing the C_max which would be minimizing the time in which the last required operation is completed.\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import time \n  from IPython.display import clear_output\n  from gepapy.job_shop import Job_Shop\n  import cupy as cp\n  import pandas as pd\n  import numpy as np\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n  pt_tmp =[[29, 78,  9, 36, 49, 11, 62, 56, 44, 21],\n         [43, 90, 75, 11, 69, 28, 46, 46, 72, 30],\n         [91, 85, 39, 74, 90, 10, 12, 89, 45, 33],\n         [81, 95, 71, 99,  9, 52, 85, 98, 22, 43],\n         [14,  6, 22, 61, 26, 69, 21, 49, 72, 53],\n         [84,  2, 52, 95, 48, 72, 47, 65,  6, 25],\n         [46, 37, 61, 13, 32, 21, 32, 89, 30, 55],\n         [31, 86, 46, 74, 32, 88, 19, 48, 36, 79],\n         [76, 69, 76, 51, 85, 11, 40, 89, 26, 74],\n         [85, 13, 61,  7, 64, 76, 47, 52, 90, 45]]\n\n  ms_tmp = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n         [0, 2, 4, 9, 3, 1, 6, 5, 7, 8],\n         [1, 0, 3, 2, 8, 5, 7, 6, 9, 4],\n         [1, 2, 0, 4, 6, 8, 7, 3, 9, 5],\n         [2, 0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 6],\n         [2, 1, 5, 3, 8, 9, 0, 6, 4, 7],\n         [1, 0, 3, 2, 6, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4],\n         [2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 3],\n         [0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 9, 6, 7, 4, 8],\n         [1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 4, 7]]\n\n  T_ = cp.array(pt_tmp,dtype=cp.float32)\n  d_ = cp.zeros(10,dtype=cp.float32)\n  w_ = cp.zeros(10,dtype=cp.float32)\n  M_ = cp.array(ms_tmp,dtype=cp.float32)\n\n\n\n\n  p = Job_Shop(n_samples=1000000,\n               n_jobs=10,\n               n_operations=10,\n               n_machines=10,\n               processing_time=T_,\n               machine_sequence=M_,\n               due_date=d_,\n               weights=w_,\n               percent_cross=0.5,\n               percent_mutation=0.1,\n               percent_intra_mutation=0.5,\n               percent_migration=0.5,\n               percent_selection=0.5,\n               fitness_type=\"max_C\")\n\n\n\n  fitness = []\n\n  start_time = time.time()\n\n  for i in range(100):\n\n      p.exec_crossA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001()\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      p.exec_mutationA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001()\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      p.exec_migrationA0001()\n      p.exec_fitnessA0001()\n      p.exec_sortA0001()\n      fitness.append(p.get_fitness()[0])\n      clear_output(wait=True)\n      print(i,p.get_fitness()[0])\n  print('the elapsed time:%s'% (time.time() -
