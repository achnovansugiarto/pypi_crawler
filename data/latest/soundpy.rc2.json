however you still won't have direct access to the 'audiodata/' or the 'jupyter_notebooks/' directories.\n\n```\n(env)..$ pip install git+https://github.com/a-n-rose/Python-Sound-Tool.git@development\n```\n\n## GPU instructions\n\nClone this repository and make it your current working directory.\n\n### Get Docker Image Running\n\nRun the bash script 'build_aju_image.sh'\n```\n$ ./build_aju_image.sh\n```\nIf you get this error:\n```\nbash: ./build_aju_image.sh: Permission denied\n```\ngive the file execution rights:\n```\n$ chmod u+x build_aju_image.sh\n```\nThis will run the Docker file and prepare everything for you. (This may take several minutes)\n\nThen run the setup file:\n\n```\n$ ./start_jup_env.sh\n```\n\nIf you want to use a Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, enter the following into the interactive Docker container command line:\n\n```\nroot@...:~/soundpy# jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root\n```\n\nOtherwise you can run python files like normal or open an ipython console:\n```\nroot@...:~/soundpy# ipython\n\nIn [1]: import soundpy as sp # for non-deep learning related functionality\nIn [2]: from soundpy import models as spdl # for deep learning related functionality\n```\n\n### Access to Datasets\n\nYou should be able to access <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview\">TensorFlow datasets</a> but if you would like the Docker image to include a dataset located elsewhere on your machine you can indicate that in the following file:\n\nstart_jup_env.sh\n\nEnter the audio data directory (replace \"audiodir/data\") so it appears like so:\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n            --gpus all \\\n            --privileged=true \\\n            -v \"$PWD\":\"/root/soundpy/\" \\\n            -v \"/audiodir/data\":\"/root/soundpy/data\" \\\n            -p 8888:8888 aju\n```\n\n# About\n\nNote: as is, soundpy is not yet a stable framework, meaning changes might periodically be made without extreme focus on backwards compatibility. \n\nThose who might find this useful: \n\n* speech and sound enthusiasts\n* digital signal processing / mathematics / physics / acoustics enthusiasts\n* deep learning enthusiasts\n* researchers\n* linguists\n* psycholinguists\n\nThe main goal of soundpy is to provide the code and functionality with more context via visualization, research, and mathematics. Most of the resources used to build the functionality stems from publicly available research and datasets. (For a list of open datasets, see my ever growing <a href='https://a-n-rose.github.io/2019/01/06/resources-publicly-available-speech-databases/'>collection</a>.)\n\nAs it covers quite a large range, from audio file conversion to implementation of trained neural networks, the purpose of soundpy is not to be the perfect implementation of all functions (although that is also a goal :P ), but rather a peak into how they *can* be implemented, hopefully offering others a foundation for trying out different ways of implementation (feature extraction, building neural networks, etc.).\n\nThis project is still in the beginning stages and has a lot of room for growth, especially with contributors having a background / knowlege in data science, computer science, machine and deep learning, physics, acoustics, or dsp. Contributors from other backgrounds are also welcome! If you'd like soundpy to do something it doesn't, try making it or create an issue.\n\n# Example datasets\n\nIf you would like to play around with various types of sound, check out my <a href='https://github.com/a-n-rose/mini-audio-datasets'>repo</a> containing mini datasets of sound, ranging from speech to noise. They are very small so don't expect much as it comes to training neural networks. \n\n# Testing\n\nIf you want to run the tests for SoundPy, they currently use some <a href=\"https://github.com/a-n-rose/mini-audio-datasets/tree/master/test_audio\">audiofiles available</a> in the example datasets repo, mentioned above. Also, see `tests_requirements.txt`. The packages located there will need to be installed via:\n\n```\n(env)..$ pip install -r tests_requirements.txt --use-feature=2020-resolver\n```\n\n# About the Author\n\nI studied clinical linguistics for my master's which introduced me to the inspiring world of open source software, python programming, and the beauty of acoustics. My interests broadened from academic experimental design to the development of tools for identifiying speech irregularities and beyond. Through this I discovered a bit of a missing niche in the Python community: a high-level sound tool for filtering, analysis, **and** deep learning that also offers context to its functionality. You can read more about me and my projects on my <a href=\"https://a-n-rose.github.io/\">blog</a>.\n\n# The Beginnings of SoundPy\n\nThis project stemmed from the Prototype Fund project <a href=\"https://github.com/pgys/NoIze\">NoIze</a> which was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ0f2x49Imc&feature=youtu.be\">presented</a> at PyConDE / PyData Berlin in 2019. This fork broadens the application of the software from smart noise filtering to general sound analysis, filtering, visualization, preparation, etc. Therefore the name has been adapted to more general sound functionality.\n\n\n",
