It will be easier to speak about strings instead of bytes.\n2. there is only one way to encode a character\n\n## **How to get binary representation of a character?**\n\nLet's use this python command to determine it:\n```\nf\"{ord(char):08b}\"\n```\n\n## **Encode \"B\"**\n\nFor 'B', we get 01000010 so 8 bits.\n\n**Notice the little gap every 6 bits as they will be used as index to the encoded character**\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 | 0 | \n\nBut, by definition, we need 24 digits. So we need to pad the last 16 bits with zeroes.\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nNow we will use the previous table to encode these 24 bits into 4 characters.\n| b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | b6 |  | Char |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | ---- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  | Q\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  | g\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  | =\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  | =\n\nLast 2 characters should be encoded as 'A' but as there is only one character to be encoded the last 2 ones are the padding characters.\n\nNow, let's examine how to encode a string of 1, 2 and 3 characters.\n\n## Encode \"Bo\"\n\nFor 'B', we still get 01000010 so 8 bits.\n\nFor 'o', we get 01101111 so 8 more bits.\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nBut, by definition, we need 24 digits. So we need to pad the last 8 bits with zeroes.\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nNow we will use the previous table to encode these 24 bits into 4 characters.\n| b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | b6 |  | Char |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | ---- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | Q\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | | m\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | | 8\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | =\n\nLast character should be encoded as 'A' but, as there are two characters to be encoded, the last one is the padding character.\n\n## **Encode \"Bob\"**\n\nFor 'B', we still get 01000010 so 8 bits.\n\nFor 'o', we still get 01101111 so 8 more bits.\n\nFor 'b', we get 01100010 so 8 more bits.\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n\nThis time we don't need any padding.\n\nNow we will use the previous table to encode these 24 bits into 4 characters.\n| b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | b6 |  | Char |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | ---- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | Q\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | | m\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | | 9\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | | i\n\nThis time there is no need to replace anything as there was no padding involved.\n\n## **Generalisation**\n\nWe can see that a string can be split into 3-characters chunks (so 3*8=24 bits) which will be independently encoded as 4 characters (so 4*6=24 bits).\n\n\nAs we've seen :\n- \"B\" will be encoded as \"Qg==\"\n- \"Bo\" will be encoded as \"Qm8=\"\n- \"Bob\" will be encoded as \"Qm9i\"\n\nSo :\n- \"BobB\" will be encoded as \"Qm9iQg==\"\n- \"BobBo\" will be encoded as \"Qm9iQm8=\"\n- \"BobBob\" will be encoded as \"Qm9iQm9i\"\n\n## **We need to do it the other way around**\n\nBut we can't just search for \"Qm9i\" in the base64-encoded text.\n\nAs we've just shown, 3 consecutive letters are encoded as base64. The text \"Dear Bob!\" will be encoded as 3-characters chunks :\n- \"Dea\" encoded as \"RGVh\"\n- \"r B\" encoded as \"ciBC\"\n- \"ob!\" encoded as \"b2Ih\"\n\nAs you can notice, \"Qm9i\" is nowhere to be found even if \"Bob\" is part of the (clear) text.\n\nIndeed, \"Bob\" can appear in 2 separated 3-characters chunks :\n- x\"Bo\", \"b\"yz\n- xy\"B\", \"ob\"z\n\nwith x, y, z being whatever character (remember: we assume, for now, that any given character is 1 byte).\n\n## **Let's analyse that first case x\"Bo\", \"b\"yz **\n\n### **First part x\"Bo\"**\n\nFor x, we get abcdefgh so 8 bits. Each letter a to h is either 0 or 1.\n\nFor 'B', we still get 01000010 so 8 more bits.\n\nFor 'o', we still get 01101111 so 8 more bits.\n\n| b01 | b02 | b03 | b04 | b05 | b06 |  | b07 | b08 | b09 | b10 | b11 | b12 |  | b13 | b14 | b15 | b16 | b17 | b18 |  | b19 | b20 | b21 | b22 | b23 | b24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| a | b | c | d | e | f |   | g | h | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nYet again, as we already have 24 bits, no padding is required.\n\nNow we will use the previous table to encode these 24 bits into 4 characters.\n| b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | b6 |  | Char |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | - | --- | ---- |\n| a | b | c | d | e | f | |  See below 1.\n| g | h | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | |  See below 2.\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |  J\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | |  v\n\nSo now we have :\n1. one character we don't care about as it does not contain any information about \"Bob\"\n2. one character than can be one of the 4\n    1. 00 0100, so 'E'\n    2. 01 0100, so 'U'\n    3. 10 0100, so 'k'\n    4. 11 0100, so '0'\n\nSo looking for \"Bo\"('b' is coming thereafter) into the clear text is \"equivalent\" (so far) to look for \"[EUk0]Jv\" into the base64-encoded text.\n\n### **Second part \"b\"yz**\n\nFor 'b', we still get 01100010 so 8 bits.\n\nFor y, we get abcdefgh so 8 more bits.
