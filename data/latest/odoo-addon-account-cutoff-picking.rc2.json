The module is named *account_cutoff_accrual_picking* because it initially only supported accruals ; support for prepaid expense/revenue was added later (it should be renamed in later versions).\n\nTo understand the behavior of this module, let's take the example of an expense accrual. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of an *Expense Accrual*:\n\n1. Odoo will look for all incoming picking in Done state with a *Transfer Date* <= *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the incoming picking dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the stock moves of those pickings and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.\n2. Once this analysis is completed, Odoo has a list of purchase order lines to analyse for potential expense accrual.\n3. For each of these purchase order lines, Odoo will:\n\n   - scan the related stock moves in *done* state and check their transfer date,\n   - scan the related invoices lines and check their invoice date.\n\n4. If, for a particular purchase order line, the quantity of products received before the cutoff-date (or on the same day) minus the quantity of products invoiced before the cut-off date (or on the same day) is positive, Odoo will generate a cut-off line.\n\nNow, let's take the example of a prepaid expense. When you click on the button *Re-Generate Lines* of a *Prepaid Expense*:\n\n1. Odoo will look for all vendor bills dated before (or equal to) *Cut-off Date*. For performance reasons, by default, the vendor bills dated before *Cut-off Date* minus 90 days will not be taken into account (this limit is configurable via the field *Picking Analysis*). It will go to the invoice lines of those vendor bills and see if they are linked to a purchase order line.\n2. Once this analysis is completed, Odoo has a list of purchase order lines to analyse for potential prepaid expense.\n3. For each of these purchase order lines, Odoo will:\n\n   - scan the related stock moves in *done* state and check their transfer date,\n   - scan the related invoices lines and check their invoice date.\n\n4. If, for a particular purchase order line, the quantity of products invoiced before the cutoff-date (or on the same day) minus the quantity of products received before the cut-off date (or on the same day) is positive, Odoo will generate a cut-off line.\n\nThis module should work well with multiple units of measure (including products purchased and invoiced in different units of measure) and in multi-currency.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nFor configuration instructions, refer to the README of the module *account_cutoff_base*.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/issues/new?body=module:%20account_cutoff_picking%0Aversion:%2016.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-alexis-via| image:: https://github.com/alexis-via.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/alexis-via\n    :alt: alexis-via\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-alexis-via| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-closing <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/tree/16.0/account_cutoff_picking>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
