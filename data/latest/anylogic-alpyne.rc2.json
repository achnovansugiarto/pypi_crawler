    "description": "# Alpyne\n\nThe **A**ny**L**ogic-**Py**thon con**ne**ctor\n\nThis is a Python library for interactively running models exported from the RL experiment. \n\nCurrently, this library released as a **public beta** (so please excuse any rough edges). If you have problems or bugs, please file them in the `Issues` tab. For general talk or questions, there's the `Discussions` tab.\n\nFull documentation (with background information, getting started guide, and class docs) can be found @ https://t-wolfeadam.github.io/Alpyne\n\nInstallation\n------------\nAlpyne supports Python 3.6+\n\nInstall this library running the following command in a terminal prompt: ``pip install anylogic-alpyne``.\n\nPreparing an AnyLogic model\n---------------------------\nYou can use *any* edition of AnyLogic (PLE, University, or Professional) with this library. However, be aware that limitations of the edition will still apply. For example, PLE users executing models which utilize industry-specific libraries have their runs limited to 1-hour simulation time. \n\nYou will need to setup your model with the following components.\n\n1. RL experiment, with the Configuration, Observation, Action, and stopping conditions filled out, as per your specifications\n2. A call to the RL experiment's ``takeAction`` method, at the moment you wish an action to be taken\n\nTo export the model, navigate to the properties of your RL experiment and click the option at the top to export it. If you do not see an option for Alpyne or generic 3rd parties, you may use the one for \"Microsoft Bonsai\".\n\nNext Steps\n----------\nThe API and overall workflow for Alpyne is intentionally similar to the AnyLogic Cloud. In your Python code, you will create a single Client object, passing a reference to where your exported model is located, in addition to setting other options. This object then gives you access to templates for the inputs/outputs of the model in addition to methods for creating new model runs, which can then be interacted with.\n\nFor more, see the [documentation page](https://t-wolfeadam.github.io/Alpyne), download the provided examples, or post in the Discussions tab.\n\n\n",
