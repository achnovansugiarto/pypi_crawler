    "description": "Installing\n============\n\nMD2D needs the dependencies:\n\n\n    numpy\n    scipy\n    matplotlib\n    mdanaysis\n\nIt can be installed locally. Under the package directory\n\n\n    pip install .\n\nIt can also be installed from pypi\n\n\n    pip install md2d\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nMD2D can be used as a standalone code\n\n\n    md2d\n\nor imported as a module\n\n\n    >>> import md2d\n    >>> md2d.diffusion(xdatcar=\"XDATACR\",outcar=\"OUTCAR\")\n\nFiles\n=====\n\nInput:\n------\nMD2D reads the output of molecular dynamics simulations in the VASP format. Only two input files will be read: XDATCAR and OUTCAR. MD2D uses MDAnalysis to transform the outputs from other molecular dynamics codes to the VASP format.\n\n..\n\n    POTIM  = 1.0000    time-step for ionic-motion\n    NBLOCK =      1;   KBLOCK =      1    inner block; outer block\n    Mass of Ions in am\n       POMASS =  55.85 \n    volume of cell :     711.71\n    kin. lattice  EKIN_LAT=         93.098925  (temperature 7275.16 K)\n    Total+kin.     3416.08  3605.40  3585.13   -42.72  -109.39   -38.68\n    \n..\n\nThe keys words “POTIM”, “NBLOCK”, “Mass of Ions in am”, “number of ions“, “volume of cell”, “EKIN_LAT=”, “Total+kin.” are used for searching.\n\nOutput:\n-------\nCalculated diffusion coefficients, viscosities, and correction to diffusion coefficient are streamed in standard output. Besides, D-tau, mean squared displacement (MSD) and stress auto-correlation function (SACF) will be written into file as X_D_tau.dat (X is the element name), msd.dat and sacf_average.dat, and their plotsare saved as D_tau.pdf, msd.pdf and SACF.pdf. In each X_D_tau.dat, the first column is the time interval, the left three columns are the Ds for x, y and z directions. The columns in msd.dat corresponds to the MSDs for the elements in the order provided in XDATCAR. The three columns in sacf_average.dat are the MD step, bulk SACF and shear SACF.\n\nHow-To Guides\n=============\n\nCalculate diffusion coefficient\n-------------------------------\nChoose option 1 will lead to the calculation of diffusion coefficient. Then, MD2D will exhaust the available time intervals to calculate the diffusion coefficient as a function of time interval. The procedure and results will be streamed on the screen, and the D-tau data will be written into the file X_D_tau.dat. \n\nTwo integer parameters will be asked for, namely, the number of initial MD steps to drop and the number of MD steps to skip for each segment. The first is to drop out the unwanted/unequilibrated initial stage of MD. The second is to exclude the ballistic motion stage from fitting the Einstein relation. The second parameter can be determined from the log-log plot or MSD.\n\nPlot D-tau\n----------\nIf diffusion coefficients have been calculated by doing option 1, then choose the option 4 will plot the D-tau curve.\nIf step one hasn’t been done, they a warning message will prompt to do option 1 firstly.\n\nCalculate MSD\n-------------\nThe MSD can be calculated and plotted by choosing option 3. The plot usually sees a change of trending, and the length of the first part is the length of ballistic motion that needs to be removed from fitting the Einstein relation.\n\nCalculate viscosities and correction to diffusion coefficient\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nThe stress auto-correlation function, viscosities, and correction to diffusion coefficient will be calculated by choosing option 2. The results will be streamed on the screen. \nThe correction to diffusion coefficient is best applied to single-component system, e.g., pure Fe liquid or molecular liquid. For complex system like silicate melt, an element- or component-wise correction according to Eq. (4) in Li and Ni, (2022) should be considered.\n\nPlot stress auto-correlation function\n-------------------------------------\nThe stress auto-correlation function can be plotted by choosing option 5 after finishing the calculation in option 2. Otherwise, MD2D will ask for doing option 2 firstly.\n\nLicense & disclaimer\n====================\nMD2D Copyright (C) University of Science and Technology of China.
