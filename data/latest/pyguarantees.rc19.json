This package ensures that you \nwon't forget.\n\n\"Why does this function fail? I've tested it... omg I didn't even call it in my TestCase.\" Use this \npackage to make sure that a function/method will be called or a class instance constructed \nin its respective `TestCase`.\n\nCan be used for `unittest` and `pytest`.\n\n## Example unittest\n\n```python \nimport unittest\nimport pyguarantees as pg\nfrom some_package import some_fct_with_test_guarantee\n\n\n@pg.testcase.guaranteed()\n@pg.testcase.calls()  # make sure that this is called in all its tests\ndef add_one(a):\n    return a + 1\n\n\n@pg.testcase.guaranteed()\n@pg.testcase.calls()  # Makes sure that __init__ is called in the test\nclass RegularClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 2\n\n\nclass ExampleTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    @pg.testcase.covers(add_one, some_fct_with_test_guarantee)\n    def test_some_stuff(self):\n        val = add_one(1)\n        self.assertEqual(val, 2)\n        # some_fct_with_test_guarantees has no @pg.testcase.call\n        #   -> doesn't have to be called here.\n      \n\n    @pg.testcase.covers(RegularClass)\n    def test_regular_class(self):\n        regular_class = RegularClass()\n        ...\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pg.unittests.main()\n```\n\nAs in the example, `pyguarantees` will be abbreviated with `pg` from here on out.\n\nFailing to use an [@pg.testcase.covers](#covers) for a function or method decorated with [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed)\nleads to a [tg.exceptions.testcase.TestsNotImplementedError](#testsnotimplementederror), while failing to use this function or method in the \ncorresponding test will lead to a [tg.exceptions.testcase.NotUsedInTestsError](#notusedintestserror) if it is decorated by \n[@tg.guarantee_usage](#guarantee_usage). These exceptions are only raised if the `unittest.TestCase` are called first \nand then checked by [pg.unittests.enforce](#enforce), or [pg.unittests.main](#main) is called to do both automatically.\n\nCurrently doesn't work with nested functions (defined inside of other callables). This might be fixed at some point.\n\n\n## Example pytest\n\n```python\n# These imports are unused but necessary for pytest to find the tests that \n#  enforce the guarantees from tg\nfrom pyguarantees.pytests import\n    test_all_tests_implemented, test_functions_used_in_tests\nimport pyguarantees as pg\n\n\nclass ExampleClass:\n    @pg.testcase.guaranteed()  # tg.main will raise exception if there is not test for this method\n    def method(self):\n        return self\n\n    @classmethod  # works for classmethods\n    @pg.testcase.guaranteed()  # @pg.testcase.calls possible in any of these methods, but optional\n    def class_method(cls):\n        return cls\n\n    @staticmethod  # works for staticmethods\n    @pg.testcase.guaranteed()\n    @pg.testcase.calls()\n    def static_method():\n        return \"static!\"\n\n\n@pg.testcase.covers(\n    ExampleClass.method,\n    ExampleClass.class_method,\n    ExampleClass.static_method\n)\ndef test_example_class():\n    assert ExampleClass.static_method() == \"static!\"\n```\n\nThis is even simpler: just use [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed), [@pg.testcase.calls](#calls),\nand [@pg.testcase.covers](#covers) as in [Example unittest](#example-unittest). No \nneed to call [pg.unittests.main](#main) or [tg.enforce](#enforce); instead, import (but don't use) \n[pg.pytests.test_all_tests_implemented](#testalltestsimplemented) and \n[pg.pytests.test_functions_used_in_tests](#testfunctionsusedintests) and then run `pytest`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If you use `pytest.mark.order` from the [pytest-order](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-order/)-package,\ndon't use `pytest.mark.order(-1)` or `pytest.mark.order(-2)` on your tests&mdash;it is important that \n[test_all_tests_implemented](#testalltestsimplemented) and [test_functions_used_in_tests](#testfunctionsusedintests) \nare used last by `pytest`.\n\n\n## Decorators\n\nThe three decorators shown below have no effect without the [functions](#functions) \nof this package, specifically running [main](#main) or [enforce](#enforce) for `unittest`, \nand simply importing [test_all_tests_implemented](#testalltestsimplemented) and \n[test_functions_used_in_tests](#testfunctionsusedintests) into one of your test-files.\n\n\n### guaranteed\n\nTakes no arguments.\n\nAny function, method, or class (except, for the moment, ones nested inside of other callables) \ndecorated with `@pg.testcase.guaranteed`\nthat is in the scope of unittest will force unittest to throw an exception should \nit not be in an [@pg.testcase.covers](#covers).\n\nCurrently, it is necessary to include the brackets&mdash;`()`&mdash; so that \nthe function is registered. This executes the decorator once but not the callable that \nit decorates, making it computationally inexpensive.\n\nHaving a function (or method) decorated like follows:\n\n```python\n@pg.testcase.guaranteed()\ndef foo():\n  pass\n```\n\nbut not having a test in your `unittest.TestCase` decorated by `@pg.testcase.covers(foo)` \nwould lead to a [TestsNotImplementedError](#testsnotimplementederror) being raised.\n\nThe same works for classes.\n\n\n### calls\n\nTakes no arguments.\n\nMust be used below [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed), otherwise it is ignored.\n\nJust like with `@pg.testcase.guaranteed`, brackets are not optional, but the execution of \nthe decorator is computationally inexpensive.\n\nA function decorated as follows:\n\n```python \n@pg.testcase.guaranteed()\n@pg.testcase.calls()\ndef foo():\n  pass\n```\n\nwith a unittest that looks something like this:\n\n```python \n# for unittest:\nclass TestExample(unittest.TestCase):\n  @pg.testcase.covers(foo)\n  def test_foo(self):\n    ...  # some code that doesn't call foo\n\n\n# for pytest:\n@pg.testcase.covers(foo)\ndef test_foo():\n  ...  # some code that doesn't call foo\n```\n\nwould lead to a [NotUsedInTestsError](#notusedintestserror) being raised. \n\nIn this scenario, if `foo` is an argument in several \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers),\n`@pg.testcase.calls` makes certain that `foo` is used in every test-function \ndecorated in such a way.\n\nSpecial case: For classes, `@pg.testcase.calls` guarantees that `__init__` is called.\nFor a callable class, this still holds; to guarantee that the `__call__`-method is called\nin the test, it has to be decorated by `@pg.testcase.calls` itself, not the class it belongs to. \n\n\n### covers\n\n- `args`: Give any function or method that the corresponding test is meant for.\n- `kwargs`: The value will be used like an `arg`, while the key will be ignored.\n\nFunctions and methods that weren't decorated by [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed) \nlead to a user-warning but are ignored otherwise.\n\nUsage might look as follows:\n\n```python \n# for unittest:\nclass TestExample(unittest.TestCase):\n  @pg.testcase.covers(function1, function2, this_key_is_ignored=function3)\n  def test_example(self):\n    ...\n\n\n# for pytest:\n@pg.testcase.covers(function1, function2, this_key_is_ignored=function3)\ndef test_example():\n  ...\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nFor `unittest`, at least one of [main](#main) or [enforce](#enforce) \nhas to be used for the [decorators](#decorators)\nto have an effect. \n\nFor `pytest`, both [test_all_tests_implemented](#testalltestsimplemented) \nand [test_functions_used_in_tests](#testfunctionsusedintests) have to be imported \ninto one of your test-files.\n\n### enforce\n\nTakes no arguments. This will likely change in the future to make it more adaptable.\n\nRun this after running all your unittests. This runs additional unittests that \ncheck which functions violated their guarantees and raise [exceptions](#exceptionstestcase) \naccordingly.\n\nIt is recommended to only use this function when using a complicated unittest-setup.\nWhen using `unittest.main()`, it is recommended to use `pg.testcase.main()` instead.\n\n### main\n\nTakes no arguments. This will likely change in the future to make it more adaptable.\n\nCalls `unittest.main()` followed by [pg.unittests.enforce](#enforce).\n\n### test_all_tests_implemented\n\nTakes no arguments.\n\nImport this into one of your files for [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed) and \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers) to have any effect.\n\n### test_functions_used_in_tests\n\nTakes no arguments.\n\nImport this and [test_all_tests_implemented](#testalltestsimplemented) \ninto one of your files for [@pg.testcase.guaranteed](#guaranteed) to \nhave any effect.\n\n## exceptions.testcase\n\n`Exceptions` are located under `pg.exceptions.testcase`.\n\nThere are two custom `Exceptions` as presented below.\n\n### TestsNotImplementedError\n\nArguments of `tg.exceptions.testcase.TestsNotImplementedError`:\n\n- `functions` (type `callable`): The callables that weren't mentioned in a \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers).\n\nMembers of `tg.exceptions.testcase.TestsNotImplementedError`:\n\n- `functions` (type `callable`): The callables that weren't mentioned in a \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers).\n- `description` (type `str`): The error string printed when the exception is raised\nand not caught.\n\nThe output of raising this exception might look something like:\n\n    <Traceback...>\n\n    pyguarantees.exceptions.testcase.TestsNotImplementedError: \n\n        No tests were implemented for the following methods and functions: \n    \n        1. Missing test-case for the following callable: \n            Name: \t\tfoo\n            Module: \t__main__\n        2. Missing test-case for the following callable: \n            Name: \t\tbar\n            Module: \t__main__\n\n### NotUsedInTestsError\nArguments of `tg.exceptions.testcase.NotUsedInTestsError`:\n\n- `functions` (type: `callable`): The callables that were mentioned in a \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers) but not used in the corresponding\ntest.\n\nMembers of `tg.exceptions.NotUsedInTestsError`:\n\n- `functions` (type: `callable`): The callables that were mentioned in a \n[@pg.testcase.covers](#covers) but not used in the corresponding\ntest.\n- `description` (type: `str`): The error string printed when the exception is raised\nand not caught.\n\nA possible error message might look like the following:\n    \n    <Traceback...>\n\n    pyguarantees.exceptions.testcase.NotUsedInTestsError:\n\n    The following objects were not used in their assigned tests: \n\n\t1. The following callable was not called in its assigned tests: \n\t\tName: \t\tfoo\n\t\tModule: \t__main__\n\t\tThis callable is tested but not called in the following test-cases: \n\t\t\t\t\t- Name: \tTestFoo.test_foo1\n\t\t\t\t\t   Module: \t__main__\n\t\t\t\t\t- Name: \tTestFoo.test_foo2\n\t\t\t\t\t   Module: \t__main__\n\t2. The following callable was not called in its assigned tests: \n\t\tName: \t\tbar\n\t\tModule: \tsome_module\n\t\tThis callable is tested but not called in the following test-cases: \n\t\t\t\t\t- Name: \tTestBar.test_bar\n\t\t\t\t\t   Module: \ttest_some_module\n\n\n# constraints\n\nFew things are more useful in programming than the ability to constrain a program's possible behaviors \nand communicate those constraints clearly in code. Statically typed languages do this with types, scope modifiers, \nand lifetime modifiers, among others (`int`, `static`, `private`, `const`, etc.). These are static constraints \nin that they are evaluated statically, before runtime.\n\nOftentimes, a program also has dynamic constraints, evaluated during runtime&mdash;assertions, for example. \nA function dealing with division, for example, has to deal with the special case of division by zero. \n\n`pyguarantees`, abbreviated by `pg` again, enables both types of guarantees to be \ndefined in Python where they should happen: function (or method) signatures. This is where statically typed \nlanguages put their static constraints (a typical function signature looks something like \n`scope-etc-modifiers return-type function-name(parameter-type parameter-name)`) and where in my opinion, dynamic \nconstraints belong as well.\n\nThis might have the following advantages:\n- Make code more readable by having constraints in a predefined place.\n- Make code easier to write by providing important information about APIs in a glancable way.\n- Make it possible to include information on dynamic constraints in automatically generated documentation.\n- Encourage programmers to think about these constraints while writing the functions&mdash;a type of \ntest-driven development directly at the function (seeing parts of the \"tests\" in the function-signature\nmight assist readability of code, as well). \n\nThis package is an attempt to open up at least some of these advantages to Python-users at least partially, \ngiven the constraints of the Python-language. \n\n## Example\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pyguarantees as pg\nfrom pyguarantees.constraints import IsInt, IsClass, DynamicCheck\n\nfrom your_module import your_custom_error_callback\n\n\n# One of many built-in guarantees using one of many built-in options\n@pg.constrain.parameters(num=IsInt(minimum=3))\ndef add_one(num):\n  return num + 1\n\n\n# Use IsClass to guarantee all types and classes that don't have specific constraints \n#  in pg.constraints. If they do, it is recommended to use those specific constraints.\n@pg.constrain.parameters(\n  X=IsClass(\n    class_type=np.ndarray,\n    dynamic_checks=[\n      DynamicCheck(check=lambda x: x.min() > 0, description=\"min: 0\"),\n      DynamicCheck(check=lambda x: x.var() < 5, description=\"var < 5\"),\n      DynamicCheck(check=lambda x: x.shape == (3, 80, 80), description=\"shape (3, 80, 80\")\n    ],\n    error_callback=your_custom_error_callback\n  ),\n  mean=IsClass(class_type=np.ndarray),\n  std=IsClass(class_type=np.ndarray)\n)\n@pg.constrain.returns(IsClass(class_type=np.ndarray))\ndef normalize(X, mean, std):\n  return (X - mean) / std\n```\n\n\n\n> this README is currently under development.
