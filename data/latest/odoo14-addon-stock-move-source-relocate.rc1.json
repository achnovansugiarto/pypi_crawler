So generally,\nwe have the goods are available, but maybe not at the correct place: this\nmodule is handy to organize internal replenishments.\n\nCompatible with ``stock_dynamic_routing``: when the source location is updated\nby this module, a dynamic routing may be applied.\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe configuration of the source relocations is done in \"Inventory > Configuration > Source Relocation\".\n\nCreation of a rule:\n\nProperties that define where the rule will be applied:\n\n* Location: any unreserved move in this location or sub-location is relocated\n* Picking Type: any unreserved move in this picking type is relocated\n* Rule Domain: filter the moves to relocate with arbitrary domains\n\nNote: all of the above must be met to relocate a move.\n\nThe Relocate Location field defines what the move source location will be changed to. It must be a sub-location of the location.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/wms/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/wms/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_move_source_relocate%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n* `Trobz <https://trobz.com>`_:\n  * Dung Tran <dungtd@trobz.com>\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe migration of this module from 13.0 to 14.0 was financially supported by Camptocamp\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/wms <https://github.com/OCA/wms/tree/14.0/stock_move_source_relocate>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
