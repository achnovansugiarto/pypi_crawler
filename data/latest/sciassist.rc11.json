Statistical learning theory studies the learning properties of machine learning algorithms , and more fundamentally , the conditions under which learning from finite data is possible . \nIn this context , classical learning theory focuses on the size of the hypothesis space in terms of different complexity measures , such as combinatorial dimensions , covering numbers and Rademacher/Gaussian complexities ( Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David , 2014 ; Boucheron et al. , 2005 ) . \nAnother more recent approach is based on defining suitable notions of stability with respect to perturbation of the data ( Bousquet & Elisseeff , 2001 ; Kutin & Niyogi , 2002 ) . \nIn this view , the continuity of the process that maps data to estimators is crucial , rather than the complexity of the hypothesis space . \nDifferent notions of stability can be considered , depending on the data perturbation and metric considered ( Kutin & Niyogi , 2002 ) . \nInterestingly , the stability and complexity approaches to characterizing the learnability of problems are not at odds with each other , and can be shown to be equivalent as shown in Poggio et al . ( 2004 ) and Shalev-Shwartz et al . ( 2010 ) . \nIn modern machine learning overparameterized models , with a larger number of parameters than the size of the training data , have become common . \nThe ability of these models to generalize is well explained by classical statistical learning theory as long as some form of regularization is used in the training process ( Bühlmann & Van De Geer , 2011 ; Steinwart & Christmann , 2008 ) . \nHowever , it was recently shown - first for deep networks ( Zhang et al. , 2017 ) , and more recently for kernel methods ( Belkin et al. , 2019 ) - that learning is possible in the absence of regularization , i.e. , when perfectly fitting/interpolating the data . \nMuch recent work in statistical learning theory has tried to find theoretical ground for this empirical finding . \nSince learning using models that interpolate is not exclusive to deep neural networks , we study generalization in the presence of interpolation in the case of kernel methods . \nWe study both linear and kernel least squares problems in this paper . \"\"\"\n\n# For string\nres = summerizer.predict(text, type=\"str\")\n# For text\nres = summerizer.predict(\"bodytext.txt\", type=\"txt\")\n# For pdf\nres = summerizer.predict(\"raw.pdf\")\n\n```\n\n## Contribution\nHere's a simple introduction about how to incorporate a new task into SciAssist. \nGenerally, to add a new task, you will need to:\n\n    1. Git clone this repo and prepare the virtual environment.\n    2. Install Grobid Server.\n    3. Create a LightningModule and a DataLightningModule.\n    4. Train a model.\n    5. Provide a pipeline for users.\n    \nWe provide a step-by-step contribution guide, see [SciAssist’s documentation](https://wing-sciassist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribution.html#).\n\n## LICENSE\nThis toolkit is licensed under the `Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International`.\nRead [LICENSE](https://github.com/WING-NUS/SciAssist/blob/main/LICENSE) for more information.\n",

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.  1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.  2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.  3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  b.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.  =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
