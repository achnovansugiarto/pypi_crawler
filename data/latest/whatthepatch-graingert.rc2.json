is a library for both parsing and applying patch files.\n\nFeatures\n---------\n\n- Parsing of almost all ``diff`` formats (except forwarded ed):\n\n  - normal (default, --normal)\n  - copied context (-c, --context)\n  - unified context (-u, --unified)\n  - ed script (-e, --ed)\n  - rcs ed script (-n, --rcs)\n\n- Parsing of several SCM patches:\n\n  - CVS\n  - SVN\n  - Git\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install What The Patch!?, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install whatthepatch\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nLet us say we have a patch file containing some changes, aptly named\n'somechanges.patch':\n\n.. code-block:: diff\n\n    --- lao\t2012-12-26 23:16:54.000000000 -0600\n    +++ tzu\t2012-12-26 23:16:50.000000000 -0600\n    @@ -1,7 +1,6 @@\n    -The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;\n    -The name that can be named is not the eternal name.\n     The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\n    -The Named is the mother of all things.\n    +The named is the mother of all things.\n    +\n     Therefore let there always be non-being,\n       so we may see their subtlety,\n      And let there always be being,\n    @@ -9,3 +8,6 @@\n     The two are the same,\n     But after they are produced,\n       they have different names.\n    +They both may be called deep and profound.\n    +Deeper and more profound,\n    +The door of all subtleties!\n\n\nParsing\n-------\n\nHere is how we would use What The Patch!? in Python to get the changeset for\neach diff in the patch:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import whatthepatch\n    >>> import pprint\n    >>> with open('tests/casefiles/diff-unified.diff') as f:\n    ...     text = f.read()\n    ...\n    >>> for diff in whatthepatch.parse_patch(text):\n    ...     print(diff) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE\n    ...\n    diff(header=header(index_path=None,\n                       old_path='lao',\n                       old_version='2013-01-05 16:56:19.000000000 -0600',\n                       new_path='tzu',\n                       new_version='2013-01-05 16:56:35.000000000 -0600'),\n         changes=[Change(old=1, new=None, hunk=1, line='The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;'),\n                  Change(old=2, new=None, hunk=1, line='The name that can be named is not the eternal name.'),\n                  Change(old=3, new=1, hunk=1, line='The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;'),\n                  Change(old=4, new=None, hunk=1, line='The Named is the mother of all things.'),\n                  Change(old=None, new=2, hunk=1, line='The named is the mother of all things.'),\n                  Change(old=None, new=3, hunk=1, line=''), Change(old=5, new=4, hunk=1, line='Therefore let there always be non-being,'),\n                  Change(old=6, new=5, hunk=1, line='  so we may see their subtlety,'),\n                  Change(old=7, new=6, hunk=1, line='And let there always be being,'),\n                  Change(old=9, new=8, hunk=2, line='The two are the same,'),\n                  Change(old=10, new=9, hunk=2, line='But after they are produced,'),\n                  Change(old=11, new=10, hunk=2, line='  they have different names.'),\n                  Change(old=None, new=11, hunk=2, line='They both may be called deep and profound.'),\n                  Change(old=None, new=12, hunk=2, line='Deeper and more profound,'),\n                  Change(old=None, new=13, hunk=2, line='The door of all subtleties!')],\n         text='...')\n\nThe changes are listed as they are in the patch, but instead of the +/- syntax\nof the patch, we get a tuple of two numbers and the text of the line.\nWhat these numbers indicate are as follows:\n\n#. ``( old=1, new=None, ... )`` indicates line 1 of the file lao was **removed**.\n#. ``( old=None, new=2, ... )`` indicates line 2 of the file tzu was **inserted**.\n#. ``( old=5, new=4, ... )`` indicates that line 5 of lao and line 4 of tzu are **equal**.\n\nPlease note that not all patch formats provide the actual lines modified, so some \nresults will have the text portion of the tuple set to ``None``.\n\nApplying\n--------\n\nTo apply a diff to some lines of text, first read the patch and parse it.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import whatthepatch\n    >>> with open('tests/casefiles/diff-default.diff') as f:\n    ...     text = f.read()\n    ...\n    >>> with open('tests/casefiles/lao') as f:\n    ...     lao = f.read()\n    ...\n    >>> diff = [x for x in whatthepatch.parse_patch(text)]\n    >>> diff = diff[0]\n    >>> tzu = whatthepatch.apply_diff(diff, lao)\n    >>> tzu  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE\n    ['The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;',\n     'The named is the mother of all things.',\n     '',\n     'Therefore let there always be non-being,',\n     '  so we may see their subtlety,',\n     'And let there always be being,',\n     '  so we may see their outcome.',\n     'The two are the same,',\n     'But after they are produced,',\n     '  they have different names.',\n     'They both may be called deep and profound.',\n     'Deeper and more profound,',\n     'The door of all subtleties!']\n\n\nContribute\n==========\n\n#.
