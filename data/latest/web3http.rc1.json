We believe we've got the public API to\na stable point now, but would strongly recommend pinning your dependencies to the `0.17.*`\nrelease, so that you're able to properly review [API changes between package updates](https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). A 1.0 release is expected to be issued sometime in 2021._\n\n---\n\nLet's get started...\n\n```pycon\n>>> import httpx\n>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')\n>>> r\n<Response [200 OK]>\n>>> r.status_code\n200\n>>> r.headers['content-type']\n'text/html; charset=UTF-8'\n>>> r.text\n'<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'\n```\n\nOr, using the async API...\n\n_Use [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or Python 3.8+ with `python -m asyncio` to try this code interactively._\n\n```pycon\n>>> import httpx\n>>> async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n...     r = await client.get('https://www.example.org/')\n...\n>>> r\n<Response [200 OK]>\n```\n\n## Features\n\nHTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:\n\n* A broadly [requests-compatible API](https://www.python-httpx.org/compatibility/).\n* Standard synchronous interface, but with [async support if you need it](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/).\n* HTTP/1.1 [and HTTP/2 support](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/).\n* Ability to make requests directly to [WSGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#calling-into-python-web-apps) or [ASGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/#calling-into-python-web-apps).\n* Strict timeouts everywhere.\n* Fully type annotated.\n* 100% test coverage.\n\nPlus all the standard features of `requests`...\n\n* International Domains and URLs\n* Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n* Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n* Browser-style SSL Verification\n* Basic/Digest Authentication\n* Elegant Key/Value Cookies\n* Automatic Decompression\n* Automatic Content Decoding\n* Unicode Response Bodies\n* Multipart File Uploads\n* HTTP(S) Proxy Support\n* Connection Timeouts\n* Streaming Downloads\n* .netrc Support\n* Chunked Requests\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with pip:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpx\n```\n\nOr, to include the optional HTTP/2 support, use:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpx[http2]\n```\n\nHTTPX requires Python 3.6+.\n\n## Documentation\n\nProject documentation is available at [https://www.python-httpx.org/](https://www.python-httpx.org/).\n\nFor a run-through of all the basics, head over to the [QuickStart](https://www.python-httpx.org/quickstart/).\n\nFor more advanced topics, see the [Advanced Usage](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/) section, the [async support](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/) section, or the [HTTP/2](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/) section.\n\nThe [Developer Interface](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/) provides a comprehensive API reference.\n\nTo find out about tools that integrate with HTTPX, see [Third Party Packages](https://www.python-httpx.org/third-party-packages/).\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you want to contribute with HTTPX check out the [Contributing Guide](https://www.python-httpx.org/contributing/) to learn how to start.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe HTTPX project relies on these excellent libraries:\n\n* `httpcore` - The underlying transport implementation for `httpx`.\n  * `h11` - HTTP/1.1 support.\n  * `h2` - HTTP/2 support. *(Optional)*\n* `certifi` - SSL certificates.\n* `rfc3986` - URL parsing & normalization.\n  * `idna` - Internationalized domain name support.\n* `sniffio` - Async library autodetection.\n* `brotlipy` - Decoding for \"brotli\" compressed responses. *(Optional)*\n\nA huge amount of credit is due to `requests` for the API layout that\nmuch of this work follows, as well as to `urllib3` for plenty of design\ninspiration around the lower-level networking details.\n\n<p align=\"center\">&mdash; ⭐️ &mdash;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i>HTTPX is <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">BSD licensed</a> code. Designed & built in Brighton, England.</i></p>\n\n\n# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## 0.17.0\n\n### Added\n\n* Add `httpx.MockTransport()`, allowing to mock out a transport using pre-determined responses.

(Pull #1197)\n* Support `Response(content=..., text=..., html=..., json=...)` for creating usable response instances in code. (Pull #1265, #1297)\n* Support instantiating requests from the low-level transport API. (Pull #1293)\n* Raise errors on invalid URL types. (Pull #1259)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Cleaned up expected behaviour for URL escaping. `url.path` is now URL escaped. (Pull #1285)\n* Cleaned up expected behaviour for bytes vs str in URL components. `url.userinfo` and `url.query` are not URL escaped, and so return bytes. (Pull #1285)\n* Drop `url.authority` property in favour of `url.netloc`, since \"authority\" was semantically incorrect. (Pull #1285)\n* Drop `url.full_path` property in favour of `url.raw_path`, for better consistency with other parts of the API. (Pull #1285)\n* No longer use the `chardet` library for auto-detecting charsets, instead defaulting to a simpler approach when no charset is specified. (#1269)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Swapped ordering of redirects and authentication flow. (Pull #1267)\n* `.netrc` lookups should use host, not host+port. (Pull #1298)\n\n### Removed\n\n* The `URLLib3Transport` class no longer exists. We've published it instead as an example of [a custom transport class](https://gist.github.com/florimondmanca/d56764d78d748eb9f73165da388e546e). (Pull #1182)\n* Drop `request.timer` attribute, which was being used internally to set `response.elapsed`. (Pull #1249)\n* Drop `response.decoder` attribute, which was being used internally. (Pull #1276)\n* `Request.prepare()` is now a private method. (Pull #1284)\n* The `Headers.getlist()` method had previously been deprecated in favour of `Headers.get_list()`. It is now fully removed.\n* The `QueryParams.getlist()` method had previously been deprecated in favour of `QueryParams.get_list()`. It is now fully removed.\n* The `URL.is_ssl` property had previously been deprecated in favour of `URL.scheme == \"https\"`. It is now fully removed.\n* The `httpx.PoolLimits` class had previously been deprecated in favour of `httpx.Limits`. It is now fully removed.\n* The `max_keepalive` setting had previously been deprecated in favour of the more explicit `max_keepalive_connections`. It is now fully removed.\n* The verbose `httpx.Timeout(5.0, connect_timeout=60.0)` style had previously been deprecated in favour of `httpx.Timeout(5.0, connect=60.0)`. It is now fully removed.\n* Support for instantiating a timeout config missing some defaults, such as `httpx.Timeout(connect=60.0)`, had previously been deprecated in favour of enforcing a more explicit style, such as `httpx.Timeout(5.0, connect=60.0)`. This is now strictly enforced.\n\n## 0.14.3 (September 2nd, 2020)\n\n### Added\n\n* `http.Response()` may now be instantiated without a `request=...` parameter. Useful for some unit testing cases. (Pull #1238)\n* Add `103 Early Hints` and `425 Too Early` status codes. (Pull #1244)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* `DigestAuth` now handles responses that include multiple 'WWW-Authenticate' headers. (Pull #1240)\n* Call into transport `__enter__`/`__exit__` or `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` when client is used in a context manager style. (Pull #1218)\n\n## 0.14.2 (August 24th, 2020)\n\n### Added\n\n* Support `client.get(..., auth=None)` to bypass the default authentication on a clients. (Pull #1115)\n* Support `client.auth = ...` property setter. (Pull #1185)\n* Support `httpx.get(..., proxies=...)` on top-level request functions. (Pull #1198)\n* Display instances with nicer import styles. (Eg. <httpx.ReadTimeout ...>) (Pull #1155)\n* Support `cookies=[(key, value)]` list-of-two-tuples style usage. (Pull #1211)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Ensure that automatically included headers on a request may be modified. (Pull #1205)\n* Allow explicit `Content-Length` header on streaming requests. (Pull #1170)\n* Handle URL quoted usernames and passwords properly. (Pull #1159)\n* Use more consistent default for `HEAD` requests, setting `allow_redirects=True`. (Pull #1183)\n* If a transport error occurs while streaming the response, raise an `httpx` exception, not the underlying `httpcore` exception. (Pull #1190)\n* Include the underlying `httpcore` traceback, when transport exceptions occur. (Pull #1199)\n\n## 0.14.1 (August 11th, 2020)\n\n### Added\n\n* The `httpx.URL(...)` class now raises `httpx.InvalidURL` on invalid URLs, rather than exposing the underlying `rfc3986` exception. If a redirect response includes an invalid 'Location' header, then a `RemoteProtocolError` exception is raised, which will be associated with the request that caused it. (Pull #1163)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Handling multiple `Set-Cookie` headers became broken in the 0.14.0 release, and is now resolved. (Pull #1156)\n\n## 0.14.0 (August 7th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.14 release includes a range of improvements to the public API, intended on preparing for our upcoming 1.0 release.\n\n* Our HTTP/2 support is now fully optional. **You now need to use `pip install httpx[http2]` if you want to include the HTTP/2 dependancies.**\n* Our HSTS support has now been removed. Rewriting URLs from `http` to `https` if the host is on the HSTS list can be beneficial in avoiding roundtrips to incorrectly formed URLs, but on balance we've decided to remove this feature, on the principle of least surprise. Most programmatic clients do not include HSTS support, and for now we're opting to remove our support for it.\n* Our exception hierarchy has been overhauled. Most users will want to stick with their existing `httpx.HTTPError` usage, but we've got a clearer overall structure now. See https://www.python-httpx.org/exceptions/ for more details.\n\nWhen upgrading you should be aware of the following public API changes. Note that deprecated usages will currently continue to function, but will issue warnings.\n\n* You should now use `httpx.codes` consistently instead of `httpx.StatusCodes`.\n* Usage of `httpx.Timeout()` should now always include an explicit default. Eg. `httpx.Timeout(None, pool=5.0)`.\n* When using `httpx.Timeout()`, we now have more concisely named keyword arguments. Eg. `read=5.0`, instead of `read_timeout=5.0`.\n* Use `httpx.Limits()` instead of `httpx.PoolLimits()`, and `limits=...` instead of `pool_limits=...`.\n* The `httpx.Limits(max_keepalive=...)` argument is now deprecated in favour of a more explicit `httpx.Limits(max_keepalive_connections=...)`.\n* Keys used with `Client(proxies={...})` should now be in the style of `{\"http://\": ...}`, rather than `{\"http\": ...}`.\n* The multidict methods `Headers.getlist()` and `QueryParams.getlist()` are deprecated in favour of more consistent `.get_list()` variants.\n* The `URL.is_ssl` property is deprecated in favour of `URL.scheme == \"https\"`.\n* The `URL.join(relative_url=...)` method is now `URL.join(url=...)`. This change does not support warnings for the deprecated usage style.\n\nOne notable aspect of the 0.14.0 release is that it tightens up the public API for `httpx`, by ensuring that several internal attributes and methods have now become strictly private.\n\nThe following previously had nominally public names on the client, but were all undocumented and intended solely for internal usage. They are all now replaced with underscored names, and should not be relied on or accessed.\n\nThese changes should not affect users who have been working from the `httpx` documentation.\n\n* `.merge_url()`, `.merge_headers()`, `.merge_cookies()`, `.merge_queryparams()`\n* `.build_auth()`, `.build_redirect_request()`\n* `.redirect_method()`, `.redirect_url()`, `.redirect_headers()`, `.redirect_stream()`\n* `.send_handling_redirects()`, `.send_handling_auth()`, `.send_single_request()`\n* `.init_transport()`, `.init_proxy_transport()`\n* `.proxies`, `.transport`, `.netrc`, `.get_proxy_map()`\n\nSee pull requests #997, #1065, #1071.\n\nSome areas of API which were already on the deprecation path, and were raising warnings or errors in 0.13.x have now been escalated to being fully removed.\n\n* Drop `ASGIDispatch`, `WSGIDispatch`, which have been replaced by `ASGITransport`, `WSGITransport`.\n* Drop `dispatch=...`` on client, which has been replaced by `transport=...``\n* Drop `soft_limit`, `hard_limit`, which have been replaced by `max_keepalive` and `max_connections`.\n* Drop `Response.stream` and` `Response.raw`, which have been replaced by ``.aiter_bytes` and `.aiter_raw`.\n* Drop `proxies=<transport instance>` in favor of `proxies=httpx.Proxy(...)`.\n\nSee pull requests #1057, #1058.\n\n### Added\n\n* Added dedicated exception class `httpx.HTTPStatusError` for `.raise_for_status()` exceptions. (Pull #1072)\n* Added `httpx.create_ssl_context()` helper function. (Pull #996)\n* Support for proxy exlcusions like `proxies={\"https://www.example.com\": None}`. (Pull #1099)\n* Support `QueryParams(None)` and `client.params = None`. (Pull #1060)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Use `httpx.codes` consistently in favour of `httpx.StatusCodes` which is placed into deprecation. (Pull #1088)\n* Usage of `httpx.Timeout()` should now always include an explicit default. Eg. `httpx.Timeout(None, pool=5.0)`. (Pull #1085)\n* Switch to more concise `httpx.Timeout()` keyword arguments. Eg. `read=5.0`, instead of `read_timeout=5.0`. (Pull #1111)\n* Use `httpx.Limits()` instead of `httpx.PoolLimits()`, and `limits=...` instead of `pool_limits=...`. (Pull #1113)\n* Keys used with `Client(proxies={...})` should now be in the style of `{\"http://\": ...}`, rather than `{\"http\": ...}`. (Pull #1127)\n* The multidict methods `Headers.getlist` and `QueryParams.getlist` are deprecated in favour of more consistent `.get_list()` variants. (Pull #1089)\n* `URL.port` becomes `Optional[int]`. Now only returns a port if one is explicitly included in the URL string. (Pull #1080)\n* The `URL(..., allow_relative=[bool])` parameter no longer exists. All URL instances may be relative. (Pull #1073)\n* Drop unnecessary `url.full_path = ...` property setter. (Pull #1069)\n* The `URL.join(relative_url=...)` method is now `URL.join(url=...)`. (Pull #1129)\n* The `URL.is_ssl` property is deprecated in favour of `URL.scheme == \"https\"`. (Pull #1128)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Add missing `Response.next()` method. (Pull #1055)\n* Ensure all exception classes are exposed as public API. (Pull #1045)\n* Support multiple items with an identical field name in multipart encodings. (Pull #777)\n* Skip HSTS preloading on single-label domains. (Pull #1074)\n* Fixes for `Response.iter_lines()`. (Pull #1033, #1075)\n* Ignore permission errors when accessing `.netrc` files. (Pull #1104)\n* Allow bare hostnames in `HTTP_PROXY` etc... environment variables. (Pull #1120)\n* Settings `app=...` or `transport=...` bypasses any environment based proxy defaults. (Pull #1122)\n* Fix handling of `.base_url` when a path component is included in the base URL. (Pull #1130)\n\n---\n\n## 0.13.3 (May 29th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Include missing keepalive expiry configuration. (Pull #1005)\n* Improved error message when URL redirect has a custom scheme. (Pull #1002)\n\n## 0.13.2 (May 27th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Include explicit \"Content-Length: 0\" on POST, PUT, PATCH if no request body is used. (Pull #995)\n* Add `http2` option to `httpx.Client`. (Pull #982)\n* Tighten up API typing in places. (Pull #992, #999)\n\n## 0.13.1 (May 22nd, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fix pool options deprecation warning. (Pull #980)\n* Include `httpx.URLLib3ProxyTransport` in top-level API. (Pull #979)\n\n## 0.13.0 (May 22nd, 2020)\n\nThis release switches to `httpcore` for all the internal networking, which means:\n\n* We're using the same codebase for both our sync and async clients.\n* HTTP/2 support is now available with the sync client.\n* We no longer have a `urllib3` dependency for our sync client, although there is still an *optional* `URLLib3Transport` class.\n\nIt also means we've had to remove our UDS support, since maintaining that would have meant having to push back our work towards a 1.0 release, which isn't a trade-off we wanted to make.\n\nWe also now have [a public \"Transport API\"](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#custom-transports), which you can use to implement custom transport implementations against. This formalises and replaces our previously private \"Dispatch API\".\n\n### Changed\n\n* Use `httpcore` for underlying HTTP transport. Drop `urllib3` requirement. (Pull #804, #967)\n* Rename pool limit options from `soft_limit`/`hard_limit` to `max_keepalive`/`max_connections`. (Pull #968)\n* The previous private \"Dispatch API\" has now been promoted to a public \"Transport API\". When customizing the transport use `transport=...`. The `ASGIDispatch` and `WSGIDispatch` class naming is deprecated in favour of `ASGITransport` and `WSGITransport`. (Pull #963)\n\n### Added\n\n* Added `URLLib3Transport` class for optional `urllib3` transport support. (Pull #804, #963)\n* Streaming multipart uploads. (Pull #857)\n* Logging via HTTPCORE_LOG_LEVEL and HTTPX_LOG_LEVEL environment variables\nand TRACE level logging. (Pull encode/httpcore#79)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Performance improvement in brotli decoder. (Pull #906)\n* Proper warning level of deprecation notice in `Response.stream` and `Response.raw`. (Pull #908)\n* Fix support for generator based WSGI apps. (Pull #887)\n* Reuse of connections on HTTP/2 in close concurrency situations. (Pull encode/httpcore#81)\n* Honor HTTP/2 max concurrent streams settings (Pull encode/httpcore#89, encode/httpcore#90)\n* Fix bytes support in multipart uploads. (Pull #974)\n* Improve typing support for `files=...`. (Pull #976)\n\n### Removed\n\n* Dropped support for `Client(uds=...)` (Pull #804)\n\n## 0.13.0.dev2 (May 12th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.13.0.dev2 is a *pre-release* version. To install it, use `pip install httpx --pre`.\n\n### Added\n\n* Logging via HTTPCORE_LOG_LEVEL and HTTPX_LOG_LEVEL environment variables\nand TRACE level logging. (HTTPCore Pull #79)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Reuse of connections on HTTP/2 in close concurrency situations. (HTTPCore Pull #81)\n* When using an `app=<ASGI app>` observe neater disconnect behaviour instead of sending empty body messages. (Pull #919)\n\n## 0.13.0.dev1 (May 6th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.13.0.dev1 is a *pre-release* version. To install it, use `pip install httpx --pre`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Passing `http2` flag to proxy dispatchers. (Pull #934)\n* Use [`httpcore` v0.8.3](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/releases/tag/0.8.3)\nwhich addresses problems in handling of headers when using proxies.\n\n## 0.13.0.dev0 (April 30th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.13.0.dev0 is a *pre-release* version. To install it, use `pip install httpx --pre`.\n\nThis release switches to `httpcore` for all the internal networking, which means:\n\n* We're using the same codebase for both our sync and async clients.\n* HTTP/2 support is now available with the sync client.\n* We no longer have a `urllib3` dependency for our sync client, although there is still an *optional* `URLLib3Dispatcher` class.\n\nIt also means we've had to remove our UDS support, since maintaining that would have meant having to push back our work towards a 1.0 release, which isn't a trade-off we wanted to make.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Use `httpcore` for underlying HTTP transport. Drop `urllib3` requirement. (Pull #804)\n\n### Added\n\n* Added `URLLib3Dispatcher` class for optional `urllib3` transport support. (Pull #804)\n* Streaming multipart uploads. (Pull #857)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Performance improvement in brotli decoder. (Pull #906)\n* Proper warning level of deprecation notice in `Response.stream` and `Response.raw`. (Pull #908)\n* Fix support for generator based WSGI apps. (Pull #887)\n\n### Removed\n\n* Dropped support for `Client(uds=...)` (Pull #804)\n\n---\n\n## 0.12.1 (March 19th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Resolved packaging issue, where additional files were being included.\n\n## 0.12.0 (March 9th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.12 release tightens up the API expectations for `httpx` by switching to private module names to enforce better clarity around public API.\n\nAll imports of `httpx` should import from the top-level package only, such as `from httpx import Request`, rather than importing from privately namespaced modules such as `from httpx._models import Request`.\n\n### Added\n\n* Support making response body available to auth classes with `.requires_response_body`. (Pull #803)\n* Export `NetworkError` exception. (Pull #814)\n* Add support for `NO_PROXY` environment variable. (Pull #835)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Switched to private module names. (Pull #785)\n* Drop redirect looping detection and the `RedirectLoop` exception, instead using `TooManyRedirects`. (Pull #819)\n* Drop `backend=...` parameter on `AsyncClient`, in favour of always autodetecting `trio`/`asyncio`. (Pull #791)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Support basic auth credentials in proxy URLs. (Pull #780)\n* Fix `httpx.Proxy(url, mode=\"FORWARD_ONLY\")` configuration. (Pull #788)\n* Fallback to setting headers as UTF-8 if no encoding is specified. (Pull #820)\n* Close proxy dispatches classes on client close. (Pull #826)\n* Support custom `cert` parameters even if `verify=False`. (Pull #796)\n* Don't support invalid dict-of-dicts form data in `data=...`. (Pull #811)\n\n---\n\n## 0.11.1 (January 17th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed usage of `proxies=...` on `Client()`. (Pull #763)\n* Support both `zlib` and `deflate` style encodings on `Content-Encoding: deflate`. (Pull #758)\n* Fix for streaming a redirect response body with `allow_redirects=False`. (Pull #766)\n* Handle redirect with malformed Location headers missing host. (Pull #774)\n\n## 0.11.0 (January 9th, 2020)\n\nThe 0.11 release reintroduces our sync support, so that `httpx` now supports both a standard thread-concurrency API, and an async API.\n\nExisting async `httpx` users that are upgrading to 0.11 should ensure that:\n\n* Async codebases should always use a client instance to make requests, instead of the top-level API.\n* The async client is named as `httpx.AsyncClient()`, instead of `httpx.Client()`.\n* When instantiating proxy configurations use the `httpx.Proxy()` class, instead of the previous `httpx.HTTPProxy()`. This new configuration class works for configuring both sync and async clients.\n\nWe believe the API is now pretty much stable, and are aiming for a 1.0 release sometime on or before April 2020.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Top level API such as `httpx.get(url, ...)`, `httpx.post(url, ...)`, `httpx.request(method, url, ...)` becomes synchronous.\n- Added `httpx.Client()` for synchronous clients, with `httpx.AsyncClient` being used for async clients.\n- Switched to `proxies=httpx.Proxy(...)` for proxy configuration.\n- Network connection errors are wrapped in `httpx.NetworkError`, rather than exposing lower-level exception types directly.\n\n### Removed\n\n- The `request.url.origin` property and `httpx.Origin` class are no longer available.\n- The per-request `cert`, `verify`, and `trust_env` arguments are escalated from raising errors if used, to no longer being available. These arguments should be used on a per-client instance instead, or in the top-level API.\n- The `stream` argument has escalated from raising an error when used, to no longer being available. Use the `client.stream(...)` or `httpx.stream()` streaming API instead.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Redirect loop detection matches against `(method, url)` rather than `url`. (Pull #734)\n\n---\n\n## 0.10.1 (December 31st, 2019)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix issue with concurrent connection acquiry. (Pull #700)\n- Fix write error on closing HTTP/2 connections. (Pull #699)\n\n## 0.10.0 (December 29th, 2019)\n\nThe 0.10.0 release makes some changes that will allow us to support both sync and async interfaces.\n\nIn particular with streaming responses the `response.read()` method becomes `response.aread()`, and the `response.close()` method becomes `response.aclose()`.\n\nIf following redirects explicitly the `response.next()` method becomes `response.anext()`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- End HTTP/2 streams immediately on no-body requests, rather than sending an empty body message. (Pull #682)\n- Improve typing for `Response.request`: switch from `Optional[Request]` to `Request`. (Pull #666)\n- `Response.elapsed` now reflects the entire download time. (Pull #687, #692)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added `AsyncClient` as a synonym for `Client`. (Pull #680)\n- Switch to `response.aread()` for conditionally reading streaming responses. (Pull #674)\n- Switch to `response.aclose()` and `client.aclose()` for explicit closing. (Pull #674, #675)\n- Switch to `response.anext()` for resolving the next redirect response. (Pull #676)\n\n### Removed\n\n- When using a client instance, the per-request usage of `verify`, `cert`, and `trust_env` have now escalated from raising a warning to raising an error. You should set these arguments on the client instead. (Pull #617)\n- Removed the undocumented `request.read()`, since end users should not require it.\n\n---\n\n## 0.9.5 (December 20th, 2019)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix Host header and HSTS rewrites when an explicit `:80` port is included in URL. (Pull #649)\n- Query Params on the URL string are merged with any `params=...` argument. (Pull #653)\n- More robust behavior when closing connections. (Pull #640)\n- More robust behavior when handling HTTP/2 headers with trailing whitespace. (Pull #637)\n- Allow any explicit `Content-Type` header to take precedence over the encoding default. (Pull #633)\n\n## 0.9.4 (December 12th, 2019)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Added expiry to Keep-Alive connections, resolving issues with acquiring connections. (Pull #627)\n- Increased flow control windows on HTTP/2, resolving download speed issues. (Pull #629)\n\n## 0.9.3 (December 7th, 2019)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed HTTP/2 with autodetection backend. (Pull #614)\n\n## 0.9.2 (December 7th, 2019)\n\n* Released due to packaging build artifact.\n\n## 0.9.1 (December 6th, 2019)\n\n* Released due to packaging build artifact.\n\n## 0.9.0 (December 6th, 2019)\n\nThe 0.9 releases brings some major new features, including:\n\n* A new streaming API.\n* Autodetection of either asyncio or trio.\n* Nicer timeout configuration.\n* HTTP/2 support off by default, but can be enabled.\n\nWe've also removed all private types from the top-level package export.\n\nIn order to ensure you are only ever working with public API you should make\nsure to only import the top-level package eg. `import httpx`, rather than\nimporting modules within the package.\n\n### Added\n\n- Added concurrency backend autodetection. (Pull #585)\n- Added `Client(backend='trio')` and `Client(backend='asyncio')` API. (Pull #585)\n- Added `response.stream_lines()` API. (Pull #575)\n- Added `response.is_error` API. (Pull #574)\n- Added support for `timeout=Timeout(5.0, connect_timeout=60.0)` styles. (Pull #593)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Requests or Clients with `timeout=None` now correctly always disable timeouts. (Pull #592)\n- Request 'Authorization' headers now have priority over `.netrc` authentication info. (Commit 095b691)\n- Files without a filename no longer set a Content-Type in multipart data. (Commit ed94950)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added `httpx.stream()` API. Using `stream=True` now results in a warning. (Pull #600, #610)\n- HTTP/2 support is switched to \"off by default\", but can be enabled explicitly. (Pull #584)\n- Switched to `Client(http2=True)` API from `Client(http_versions=[\"HTTP/1.1\", \"HTTP/2\"])`. (Pull #586)\n- Removed all private types from the top-level package export. (Pull #608)\n- The SSL configuration settings of `verify`, `cert`, and `trust_env` now raise warnings if used per-request when using a Client instance. They should always be set on the Client instance itself. (Pull #597)\n- Use plain strings \"TUNNEL_ONLY\" or \"FORWARD_ONLY\" on the HTTPProxy `proxy_mode` argument. The `HTTPProxyMode` enum still exists, but its usage will raise warnings. (#610)\n- Pool timeouts are now on the timeout configuration, not the pool limits configuration. (Pull #563)\n- The timeout configuration is now named `httpx.Timeout(...)`, not `httpx.TimeoutConfig(...)`. The old version currently remains as a synonym for backwards compatability.  (Pull #591)\n\n---\n\n## 0.8.0 (November 27, 2019)\n\n### Removed\n\n- The synchronous API has been removed, in order to allow us to fundamentally change how we approach supporting both sync and async variants. (See #588 for more details.)\n\n---\n\n## 0.7.8 (November 17, 2019)\n\n### Added\n\n- Add support for proxy tunnels for Python 3.6 + asyncio.

(Pull #502)\n- Use TRACE log level for low level info. (Pull #500)\n\n## 0.7.6 (November 2, 2019)\n\n### Removed\n\n- Drop `proxies` parameter from the high-level API. (Pull #485)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Tweak multipart files: omit null filenames, add support for `str` file contents. (Pull #482)\n- Cache NETRC authentication per-client. (Pull #400)\n- Rely on `getproxies` for all proxy environment variables. (Pull #470)\n- Wait for the `asyncio` stream to close when closing a connection. (Pull #494)\n\n## 0.7.5 (October 10, 2019)\n\n### Added\n\n- Allow lists of values to be passed to `params`. (Pull #386)\n- `ASGIDispatch`, `WSGIDispatch` are now available in the `httpx.dispatch` namespace. (Pull #407)\n- `HTTPError` is now available in the `httpx` namespace.  (Pull #421)\n- Add support for `start_tls()` to the Trio concurrency backend. (Pull #467)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Username and password are no longer included in the `Host` header when basic authentication\n  credentials are supplied via the URL. (Pull #417)\n\n### Removed\n\n- The `.delete()` function no longer has `json`, `data`, or `files` parameters\n  to match the expected semantics of the `DELETE` method.

(Pull #377)\n\n## 0.7.3 (September 20, 2019)\n\n### Added\n\n- HTTP Proxy support. (Pulls #259, #353)\n- Add Digest authentication. (Pull #332)\n- Add `.build_request()` method to `Client` and `AsyncClient`. (Pull #319)\n- Add `.elapsed` property on responses. (Pull #351)\n- Add support for `SSLKEYLOGFILE` in Python 3.8b4+.
