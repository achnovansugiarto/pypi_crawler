    "description": "# semicon - k·p simulations made easy\n\nNote: this is work in progress, comments and ideas are more than welcomed!\n\nThe goal of this package is to provide easy to use framwerok for performing k·p simulations.\nThere will be two main components of this framework: parameters and models.\n\nThis package is suppose to remove an overhead and a boiler plate that appears when doing the k·p simulations.\nIt is suppose to make things easier, therefore userfriendly interface is a priority.\n\n\n# Models\n\nModels are based on the k·p Kane Hamiltonian, symmetrized following Burt-Foreman approach.\nUsers should be able to choose which components (Zeeman, Dresselhaus, strain, ...) and which bands ('gamma_6c', 'gamma_8v', ...) shall be included.\n\n\n# Parameters\n\nParameters bank should include most common semiconducting materials.\nHelper functions should handle parameter renormalization based on included bands and way to avoid spurious solutions.\n\n\n# Helper functions\n\nGoal of this framework is to make k.p simulations easy.\nHowever, building the actual Kwant system and peforming the simulation should be done by user and this library only provide helper tools that are specific to problems encountered in k.p simulations\n\n\n# Requirements\n\n* This package is suppose to work with latest stable release of Kwant.\n* This package will require [SciPy 1.2](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/milestone/36) that is scheduled to be released in November 2018.\nThis is due to usage of [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html#scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation) to find the rotation vector of a given rotation matrix.\n* Because project is based on discretizer sympy is required, however, due to compatibility [issue](https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/kwant/issues/225) it must be in version lower than 1.2\n\n\n# Installation\nAs this package is pure python standard python installation from sources with\n```\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\n```\nshould be working without problems.\nThe only non-trivial dependency, Kwant, that could cause problemS if not installed beforehand can be either obtained via ``conda`` or any other installation means explained on its [homepage](https://kwant-project.org/).\n\nDirect installation from git is also possible (and favoured as long as conda\npackage is not out there):\n```\npip install git+https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/semicon/semicon.git\n```\n\nNote that due to active development master branch may not be stable.\nTo install version that has been already used in research project use\n```\npip install git+https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/semicon/semicon.git@v0.1.0\n```\n\n\n# Tips about developing inside docker container\n\nOne can easily use a [rafalskolasinski/science](https://github.com/RafalSkolasinski/science-docker)\nDocker container for a development of this project.\nAssuming that ``semicon`` folder is ``~/work/semicon`` do:\n```\ndocker pull rafalskolasinski/science:semicon\ndocker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name semicon \\\n    -v ~/work/semicon:/src -v ~/work/semicon/notebooks:/home/jovyan/work \\\n    rafalskolasinski/science:semicon\n```\n\nThis will mount source code in ``/src`` and project notebooks in ``~/work``\ninside the containier. It will also start ``jupyter notebook`` server running\nat ``localhost:8888``. You will need to read jupyter's server token with\n``docker logs semicon`` to access the server.\n\nYou can now use ``docker exec semicon build`` and ``docker exec semicon test``\nto build the package or run the tests respectively.\n\nYou can enter bash inside the container by running\n```\ndocker exec -it semicon bash\n```\n\nNicely formatted output of tests (colors):\n```\ndocker exec -it semicon test -v\n```\n\n\n",
