It uses\n*[progressions]* in order to build up an optimized *[path]* of material to learn\nin order. Following this path will help lower the difficulty level.\n\nThis project was built with the intermediate to advanced learner in mind. You\nshould be comfortable with Hiragana, Katakana, Japanese pronunciation, and basic\ngrammar in order to make the most effective use of this project.\n\nThere are several great resources out there for beginners, including the\n[Duolingo] Japanese course and [Tae Kim's Guide]. Once you've learned the\nbasics, you can use this project to quickly learn kanji and build up your\nvocabulary.\n\n### What is a \"progression\"?\n\nMost kanji are *compositions* - they are composed of two or more simple\ncomponents, combined together to create a more complex character. If you already\nknow the components that make up a kanji, then it's a much easier task to learn\nthat kanji. You're just combining what you already know instead of learning\nsomething completely new.\n\n> For example, the composition of the kanji `時` \"time, hour\" is `日`\n> \"day, sun\" and `寺` \"Buddhist temple\".\n\nThe components in a kanji composition may themselves be composed of other\ncomponents.\n\n> `寺` in the previous example is composed of `土` \"earth, ground\" and `寸`\n> \"length, measurement\".\n\nA *progression* is the complete list of components, in order, that are required\nto build a kanji character, including the character itself.\n\n> The progression to build the kanji `時` is: `日`, `土`, `寸`, `寺` and finally\n> `時`.\n\nMost words and sentences are also *compositions*.\n\nWords are often composed of two or more kanji, words, or other components (ex.\nprefixes and suffixes).\n\n> For example, the word `時間`, meaning \"time, hour\", is composed of two kanji:\n> `時` \"time, hour\" and `間` \"interval, space\". We already know the composition\n> for `時`. The composition for `間` is `門` \"gate\" and `日` \"day, sun\".\n>\n> The progression to build this word is: `日`, `土`, `寸`, `寺`, `時`, `門`, `間`,\n> and finally `時間`.\n\nSentences are composed of two or more words or other components (ex. particles\nor punctuation).\n\n> For example, the sentence `もう乗り込む時間だ。`, translated as \"It's time to get\n> aboard.\", is composed of the following:\n> 1. The word `もう` \"now, soon\"\n> 2. The compound word `乗り込む` \"to board\"\n>    - `乗る` and `込む` combine to form the word `乗り込む`.\n> 3. The word `時間` \"time, hour\"\n> 4. The copula `だ` \"to be, is\"\n> 5. The Japanese period `。`\n>\n> The progression to build this sentence is: `もう`, `乗`, `乗る`, `辵`, `辵(⻍)`,\n> `入`, `込`, `込む`, `乗り込む`, `日`, `土`, `寸`, `寺`, `時`, `門`, `間`, `時間`,\n> `だ`, `。`, and finally `もう乗り込む時間だ。`.\n\n### What is a \"path\"?\n\nProgressions are used to build up an optimized *path* of components that should\nbe learned in order. A path will start with simple components and build up to\nmore complex components. Complex components will not appear until all of the\ncomponents in their progression (excluding themselves) have appeared. This order\nwill minimize the amount of new material introduced in each increment of the\nlearning process.\n\nA path is more opinionated than a progression. It's usually structured in order\nto achieve some goal or a set of goals. The default path provided by this\nproject tries to balance the following goals:\n\n1. Learn the primary and secondary Jōyō kanji\n2. Learn the Jinmeiyō kanji\n3. Learn high priority words, according to JMdict\n4. Learn any other kanji or words that appear frequently in Tatoeba sentences\n5. Reinforce kanji and vocabulary with example sentences\n\nThe default path is split into several levels, each with its own set of\nparameters for the goals above. The early levels of the path are more focused on\nintroducing kanji, while the later levels are more focused on building\nvocabulary. See the [Stats] section for more of a breakdown.\n\nThis project also includes tools to build your own custom *path* in order to\nmeet your own interests and learning objectives.\n\n> For example, if you like JPop or JRock, and you have some song lyrics and\n> translations, you could use this project to build a path that would cover the\n> kanji and words used in those lyrics with lines from the song used as example\n> sentences.\n>\n> You can apply this approach to other forms of media, as well. For example, you\n> could build a path for a TV show, movie, or other video by processing the\n> subtitles and translations, if available. You could also build a path from one\n> or more book files provided by Aozora Bunko or another free book provider.\n\nSee the `examples/` directory for more some examples.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you would just like to install the Anki decks for this project, see the\n[Installing Anki Decks] section. If you need to upgrade to the latest version,\nsee the [Upgrading Anki Decks] section.\n\nYou can install this project with pip:\n```sh\n$ pip install progja\n```\n\nSee the `examples/` directory for example usage.\n\n### Installing Anki Decks\n\nIt is recommended that you backup your Anki profile before proceeding.\n\nThe Anki decks provided by this project are available via AnkiWeb:\n1. [Progressive Japanese (Lv. 1)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1475570445)\n2. [Progressive Japanese (Lv. 2)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1622728973)\n3. [Progressive Japanese (Lv. 3)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/188104618)\n4. Progressive Japanese (Lv. 4) (pending)\n5. Progressive Japanese (Lv. 5) (pending)\n\n### Upgrading Anki Decks\n\nIt is recommended that you backup your Anki profile before proceeding.\n\nUpdating a deck should be as easy as downloading the new `.apkg` file and\nopening it with Anki.\n\nSome of the cards in the deck may get removed in newer versions. You will\nprobably want to find these cards and either delete them or suspend them. There\nis a simple way to locate these cards: the `progja::version::<version>` tag.\n\nAll cards are tagged with a `progja::version::<version>` tag. When you update to\na new version, this tag will be updated with the new version number. If a card\nwas removed in the new version, then its tag will not be updated, making it easy\nto locate. Simply search for any cards in the deck that are not tagged with the\nnew version number.\n\n> For example, if you upgrade from version 1.2.3 to version 1.2.4, cards still\n> tagged with `progja::version::1.2.3` (or some other version) are no longer\n> included in version 1.2.4 of the project. You can use the search term\n> `-tag:progja::version::1.2.4` to find all cards not tagged with the new\n> version number.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThis project is not perfect (yet). There are a few caveats you should be aware\nof before using it for your own studies and in your own projects.\n\n- The project is still under active development. It may contain bugs.\n- The source for word data is JMdict, a dictionary database. It's a relatively\n  exhaustive source for words and definitions. As a result, some words in this\n  project have many, many definitions and variations.\n    - Our advice is to focus on the first few definitions and treat the\n      remaining as optional/extra information.\n- The source for sentence data is Tatoeba. Sentences and translations are\n  crowd-sourced and managed by volunteers. As a result, some sentences in this\n  project may be a bit random or may have low quality translations.\n- Sentences and words are split into subcomponents using a tokenizer. The way\n  that the tokenizer splits some words and sentences can often result in strange\n  or nonintuitive components (notably: grammatical components). You will likely\n  encounter several of these.\n    - Our advice is to just move past these as you study if they do not provide\n      any value to you. Treat them as optional/extra information.\n- Sentence readings  had to be hacked together and may be inaccurate. We are\n  exploring additional options, like text-to-speech audio readings.\n\n## Stats\n\n> Note: These numbers may not correspond exactly to the number of\n> cards in each Anki deck.\n\nCompletion schedule (kanji, words, sentences):\n\n> The numbers below are cumulative for each path level.
