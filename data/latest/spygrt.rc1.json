    "description": "# SpyGRT\r\n\r\nSpyGRT, or Surface Guided Radiotherapy Toolkit in Python is a toolkit that allows fast development of novel surface guidance applications for radiotherapy. \r\n\r\nSpyGRT allows easy: \r\n- Operation of the depth camera (current model is Intel Realsense D415)\r\n- Calibration of multiple cameras into the same external frame of reference\r\n- Tracking of motion using an ICP workflow \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Installing SpyGRT using pip\r\nThe preferred method for installing SpyGRT is to use pip. This will download all the required packages, however a list of prerequisites and where to find them are listed in the next section in case you prefer to build them from source.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to installing SpyGRT with pip\r\n\r\n  1. Clone the SpyGRT GitHub repo\r\n  2. Open a command prompt \r\n  3. Navigate to the SpyGRT folder (not the embedded spygrt folder)\r\n  4. Enter the following pip command\r\n  \r\n```\r\npip install -e . \r\n```\r\n  5. You should now be able to run SpyGRT\r\n\r\n### Prerequesites\r\n\r\n#### 1. Intel RealSense SDK2.0 \r\n\r\nIf you want to build from source, installation instructions available [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense). The code has currently only been tested up to release version 2.5.0 but should work with more recent releases. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Open3D library v.0.15.0 or later\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, full release available [here](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) and instructions to compile it yourself are available [here](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html).\r\n\r\n#### 3. OpenCV \r\n\r\nFull release available [here](https://opencv.org/releases/), if you prefer to build it from source. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Numpy\r\nMore Information available [here](https://numpy.org/install/)\r\n\r\n### Working Examples\r\nThe example folder contain three examples that illustrate how to use the basic functions of SpyGRT. More instructions are located in that folder.\r\n\r\n### Depth Sensor\r\nSpyGRT is currently built to use [Intel RealSense D415](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d415/) stereo depth sensors for capturing depth data. However, it should be possible to modify the stream module to work with any commercial depth sensors that have a python API. \r\n\r\n### Intel RealSense Viewer\r\nWhile SpyGRT contains the required code for real-time SGRT and analysis of prior recordings, it cannot currently be used to create new recordings. We suggest installing the free realsense-viewer app available [here](https://www.intelrealsense.com/sdk-2/) if you want to create your own recordings. \r\n\r\n## Calibrations Boards\r\n\r\n### Default SpyGRT Calibration Board\r\n\r\nSpyGRT uses a checkerboard to calibrate multiple cameras. By default, it assumes that the checkboard has 5 rows, 8 columns, and that the length of the sides of each square is 4.3 centimeters. If you want to print the default checkerboard, you can find it in a powerpoint file located in the SampleData folder. This file should be printed on an A3 paper to get the accurate dimensions. \r\n\r\n### Custom Calibration Board\r\nAny checkerboard can be use to calibrate cameras with SpyGRT. If you want to use a custom checkerboard, you will need to change the following default variables in *calibration.py*\r\n\r\n1. **DEFAULT_ROW**: Number of rows in the custom calibration board.\r\n2. **DEFAULT_COLUMN**: Number of columns in the custom calibration board\r\n3. **DEFAULT_SQUARE_SIZE**: Length in meters of the sides of a square in the custom calibration board \r\n\r\n## Tracking with SpyGRT\r\nCalibration files are necessary to use the SpyGRT for tracking. By default, SpyGRT will look for calibration files *../Calibrations/*. If you want to change this path, you must change the following constant in *tracker.py*\r\n\r\n- **CALIBRATION_FOLDER**\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nYoussef Ben Bouchta\r\n\r\n\r\n",
