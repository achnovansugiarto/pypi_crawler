    "description": "GUIE (GUI Editor) provides a simple WYSIWYG GUI editor for wxWidgets and\r\nIronPython. The\r\nprogram was made in C# and saves the GUI that was created to a XML format I\r\ncalled GUIML. This GUIML is a pretty standard representation of the GUI created\r\nwith the program with some helpful additions for .NET. Next, GUIE takes these\r\nGUIML files and translates it to either wxPython Python code or wxRuby Ruby code\r\n(more languages in the future). You may ask yourself why I took the extra step?\r\nWhy didn't I go straight from C# controls to wxPython code? Why is GUIML\r\nnecessary? Well, it isn't. It is there simply for people (or maybe I) to take\r\nthe GUIML and convert it to other languages. This, by effect can convert this\r\ntool from a Python GUI editor, to \"any programming language with a GUI module\"\r\nGUI editor.\r\n\r\nChanges (as of v0.5.3)\r\n    Added: Support for different tab-types (space & real-tabes), see settings\r\n    Fixed: Error when trying to export empty PictureBox\r\n    Changed: Removed dotted background\r\n    Fixed: Align to grid offset fix\r\n    Added: Align to grid to settings file, now choice is saved\r\n\r\nChanges (as of v0.5.2)\r\n    Added: IronPython GUI Support! (Microsoft .NET Windows Forms in Python)\r\n\r\nChanges (as of v0.5.1)\r\n    Added: Drag & Drop functionality for adding controls\r\n    Changed: Settings mechanism. \"settings.opt\" replacing \"settings.xml\".\r\n    Fixed: Bug causing panel background color to be other than white\r\n\r\nChanges (as of v0.5)\r\n    Added: Source release\r\n    Added: Partial wxPerl support\r\n    Fixed: Splash screen causes loading delay\r\n    Fixed: When saving guiml, controls got a gray background-color\r\n    Changed: Certain GUI improvements in settings form\r\n    Fixed: Actions should be disabled when no form is open\r\n    Changed: Logo in splash screen\r\n    Fixed: XY Coords incorrect when hovering controls\r\n    Added: Unicode support in guiml files",
