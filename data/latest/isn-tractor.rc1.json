    "description": "# ISN-tractor\nInteractome based Individual Specific Networks (Ib-ISN)\n\n## About the project: Interactome Based Individual Specific Networks (Ib-ISN) Computation and its relevance\n\nAn *individual-specific network* in biology is a sort of network that depicts the relationships between the genes, proteins, or other biological molecules of a particular individual. \n\nIt is sometimes referred to as a \"personalised network\" or \"individual network\". \n\nThese networks can be computed using a range of data types, including genetic information, details on protein expression, and other omics data.\n\nOne of the top aims of individual-specific networks is to comprehend **how interactions between different biological molecules affect an individual's overall function and behaviour**. For example, an individual-specific network can be used to identify the proteins that are essential for maintaining a certain biological activity or the critical regulatory networks that control a person's gene expression. It is also possible to forecast how genetic or environmental changes may affect a person's biology by using individual-specific networks. For instance, they can be used to foretell how a specific mutation or environmental exposure may impact the way a certain gene or pathway functions.\n\nThe entire range of interactions between biological macromolecules in a cell, including as those mediated by protein-ligand binding or solely functional connections between proteins, are referred to as the *interactome*. As a result, it offers a summary of the functional activity within a particular cell. Extracellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are particularly significant to illness causation, diagnosis, and treatment due to a number of features. Their functional diversity, chaos, and complexity are a few of these.\n\n[Luck et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2188-x) introduced *HuRI*, a human \"all-by-all\" reference interactome map of human binary protein interactions, which has been demonstrated to have over 53,000 protein-protein interactions. \n\nHuRI, as \n> a systematic proteome-wide reference that connects genetic variation to phenotypic outcomes,\n\nwas the impetus for our decision to create a novel approach for computing interactome-based ISN, starting from SNP data and ending with a gene-based network.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install isn-tractor\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Data preprocessing and imputation\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport isn_tractor.ibisn as it\n\nsnps = pd.read_csv(\"snp_dataset.csv\")\nsnp_meta = pd.read_csv(\"snp_metadata.csv\")\ninteract = pd.read_csv(\"interactome_interactions.csv\")\ngtf = pd.read_csv(\"human_genes.csv\")\n\n# returns \ngene_info = it.preprocess_gtf(gtf)\n\n# returns \nit.preprocess_snp(snp_meta)\n\n# returns \nsnps = it.impute(snps)\n```\n\n2. Mapping\n\n```python\n# returns \nit.positional_mapping(snp_meta, gene_info, neighborhood=5)\n```\n\n3. Features mapping and interaction\n\n```python\n# returns \n(interact_snp, interact_gene) = it.snp_interaction(interact, gene_info, snp_info)\n```\n\n4. Individual Specific Network (ISN) computation\n\n```python\nisn = it.compute_isn(df, interact_snp, interact_gene, \"spearman\", \"max\")\n```\n\nFor more examples, please refer to the _Documentation_.\n\n## Roadmap\n- [ ] Complete the _Usage_ section\n- [ ] Add documentation with examples\n- [ ] Consider a new function for functional mapping\n- [ ] Add:\n    - [ ] Imputation with file saving\n    - [ ] Function ```isn_calculation_per_edge```\n    - [ ] Progressbar\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such a wonderful place to learn, be inspired, and create. \nYour contributions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nIf you have an idea for how to improve this, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. You can alternatively open a new issue with the tag \"improvement\". Don't forget to :star: the project! Thank you once more!\n\n1. Fork the Project\n2.
