    "description": "QtARMSim\n========\n\nQtARMSim is an easy to use graphical ARM simulator. It provides an easy\nto use multiplatform ARM emulation environment that has been designed\nfor Computer Architecture introductory courses.\n\nThe ARMSim ARM simulator, Copyright (c) 2014-20 by Germán Fabregat, is\nbundled with QtARMSim. It can be found on the ``armsim/``\nsubdirectory of the QtARMSim installation path.\n\n\n1. Installing QtARMSim\n----------------------\n\nIn order to install QtARMSim, its dependencies should be installed first.\n\nQtARMSim has the following dependencies: `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_,\n`Qt for Python (PySide2) <https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python>`_, and ARMSim.\n\nARMSim, which is bundled with QtARMSim, has in turn the next dependencies:\n`Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ and the\n`GNU GCC Arm toolchain <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_.\n\nThe next subsections describe how to install QtARMSim and its dependencies on\nGNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.\n\n\n1.1 Installing QtARMSim on GNU/Linux\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe major GNU/Linux distributions already provide packages for ``Python3`` and\n``Ruby``. Therefore, the provided package manager can be used to install them.\nAs for the GNU GCC, the required part of the GNU GCC Arm toolchain is bundled\nwith QtARMSim. Finally, ``Qt for Python`` and ``QtARMSim`` can be installed\nusing the ``pip3`` command provided by ``Python3``.\n\nFor example, on Ubuntu you can install QtARMSim using:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ sudo apt install python3-pip ruby libxcb-xinerama0\n    $ sudo gem install shell e2mmap sync\n    $ sudo pip3 install QtARMSim\n\nOn a Gentoo distribution, you can install QtARMSim issuing (as root):\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    # emerge -av pip ruby\n    # pip3 install --user QtARMSim\n\nIf you are installing QtARMSim on a system where PySide2 is already provided as\na package, you can install the packaged version of PySide2 and then install\nQtARMSim using the ``--no-deps`` option (be aware that the packaged version can\nbe not so to up to date as the one obtained from pip). Once the PySide2\npackage(s) are installed, QtARMSim should be installed as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    # sudo pip3 install --no-deps QtARMSim\n\n\n1.2 Installing QtARMSim on Windows\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo install QtARMSim on Windows please follow the next steps:\n\n1. Download a 64 bits **Python executable installer** from\n   `Python releases for Windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_.\n   During the installation process, please select the ``Add Python 3.X to PATH``\n   option.\n\n2. Download a 64 bits **Ruby with Devkit** installer from\n   `Ruby Installer for Windows <http://rubyinstaller.org/>`_.\n   During the installation process, make sure that the\n   ``Add Ruby executables to your PATH`` option is selected.\n\n3. Open a Windows console (executing either ``Windows PowerShell`` or\n   ``cmd``, depending on your Windows version), and execute the commands\n   indicated in the next steps.\n\n   3.1. Install the ``shell``, ``e2mmap`` and ``sync`` Ruby modules with:\n\n   .. code-block:: powershell\n\n     PS C:\\Users\\Username> gem install shell e2mmap sync\n\n   3.2. Install QtARMSim using the ``pip3`` command:\n\n   .. code-block:: powershell\n\n     PS C:\\Users\\Username> pip3 install QtARMSim\n\n\n\n1.3 Installing QtARMSim on macOS\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo install QtARMSim on macOS, please follow the next steps:\n\n1. Download and install **Python 3** from the\n   `Python downloads page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.\n\n2. Open a ``Terminal`` and execute the next command:\n\n   .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n     $ sudo -H pip3 install QtARMSim\n\nAfter doing the previous steps, you should be able to execute QtARMSim by\ntyping ``qtarmsim`` on a **new** ``Terminal``.\n\nNote: If an error message appeared when executing the ``pip3`` command saying that\nthere was no matching distribution of PySide2 for your macOS version, you can\ninstead install PySide2 with\n`MacPorts <https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode>`_ and QtARMSim with no\ndependencies using the following commands (MacPorts should be installed\npreviously):\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n  $ sudo port install py39-pyside2   # same version as the installed Python\n  $ sudo -H pip3 install --no-deps QtARMSim\n\n\n1.4 Installing the ``GNU GCC Arm toolchain`` (optional)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nStarting with version 0.3.1 of QtARMSim, the required part of the ``GNU GCC Arm\ntoolchain`` is already bundled with QtARMSim. So this step should only be done\nif there is a problem with the bundled GNU GCC Arm toolchain (i.e., QtARMSim\nis not able to assemble any source code).\n\nIn this case, another instance of GNU GCC Arm toolchain can be installed and used.\n\nOn GNU/Linux, this can be accomplished by installing a GNU GCC ARM package\nprovided by the GNU/Linux distribution being used, by building a cross-compiling\ntoolchain, or by extracting the ``gcc-arm-none-eabi-????-linux.tar.bz2``\nfile from the `GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Downloads page\n<https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads>`_.\n\nFor example, on Ubuntu, this optional step can be achieved with:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi\n\nAnd on Gentoo with:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n  # emerge -av crossdev\n  # echo \"PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage\" >> /etc/portage/make.conf\n  # crossdev --target arm --ov-output /usr/local/portage\n\nOn Windows and macOS, to perform this optional step, download and execute the\nrespective Windows or macOS GNU GCC Arm toolchain package from the\n`GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Downloads page\n<https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads>`_.\n\nOnce a new ``GNU GCC Arm toolchain`` is installed, please\nconfigure the ``ARMSim Gcc Compiler`` QtARMSim option to point to the new\n``arm-none-eabi-gcc`` executable.\n\n\n2. Executing QtARMSim\n---------------------\n\nTo execute QtARMSim, run the ``qtarmsim`` command, or click on the corresponding\nentry on the applications menu (on GNU/Linux, under the ``Education:Science``\ncategory).\n\n\n3. Upgrading QtARMSim\n---------------------\n\nTo upgrade an already installed version of QtARMSim, execute the following\ncommand on GNU/Linux:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSim\n\nOn Windows:\n\n.. code-block:: powershell\n\n    PS C:\\Users\\Username> pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSim\n\nOn macOS:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSim\n\n\n4. Uninstalling QtARMSim\n------------------------\n\nTo uninstall QtARMSim on GNU/Linux, execute the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ sudo pip3 uninstall QtARMSim\n\nOn Windows:\n\n.. code-block:: powershell\n\n    PS C:\\Users\\Username> pip3 uninstall QtARMSim\n\nOn macOS:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    sudo -H pip3 uninstall QtARMSim\n\n\n5. Installation related known issues\n------------------------------------\n\nIf something goes wrong after installing QtARMSim, executing the ``qtarmsim``\ncommand on a terminal could give some insight of what is the cause of the error.\n\nThe next known issues should not occur if the installation instructions are\nfollowed to the letter. They are listed here just in case they can be of some\nhelp when upgrading a previously installed version.\n\n+ The 5.14 packaged version of PySide2 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS does not properly\n  display some icons and SVG images of QtARMSim. This can be solved by\n  installing a newer version of PySide2 using ``pip``::\n\n    $ sudo pip3 install PySide2\n\n+ On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, if the next error is shown when executing QtARMSim from\n  a terminal::\n\n    qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\" in \"\" even though it was found.\n    [...]\n\n  It can be solved by installing the package ``libxcb-xinerama0``::\n\n    $ sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0\n\n+ Starting with the 2.5 version of the Ruby installer, ``shell``, ``e2mmap``\n  and ``sync`` ruby modules are no longer bundled in. Therefore, they must be\n  manually installed using the ``gem`` command, as stated in the general\n  instructions.\n\n+ Versions 5.12.0 and 5.12.1 of PySide2 introduced some changes that prevented\n  QtARMSim to work. Version 5.12.2 of PySide2 corrected these regressions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2014-20 Sergio Barrachina Mir <barrachi@uji.es>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at\nyour option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The new memory organization\n  consists of two ROM blocks and two RAM blocks. The first ROM block\n  is filled with the assembled user code. The second ROM, with the\n  firmware machine code. The first RAM can be used to store the user\n  program data. The second RAM is used by the LCD display.\n- The graphical interface now uses a thread to retrieve the memory\n  contents and the disassembled code from the two ROM blocks.\n- The regular expressions used to highlight the code on the editors\n  have been optimized to increase the highlighting process speed.\n\n0.3.5 (2016-09-12)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- Improved the Mac OS X compatibility and added installation\n  instructions for this platform.\n- Changed the minimum size of the code editor container to accommodate\n  lower resolution screens.\n- ARMSim: (i) LSL result is now bounded to 32 bits; (ii) command\n  redirection is performed explicitly to avoid an error on newer\n  Windows versions; and (iii) the method used to compare whether\n  memory blocks where not defined has been changed to avoid errors on\n  Ruby with version >= 2.3.\n\n0.3.4 (2016-01-21)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- Added a memory dump dock widget that allows to see and edit the\n  memory at byte level. It also shows the ASCII equivalent of each\n  byte.\n- Added a LCD display dock widget that provides a simple output\n  system. It has a size of 32x6 and each character is mapped to a\n  memory position starting a 0x20070000.\n\n0.3.3 (2015-11-28)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- Added a visual indication of which instructions have already been\n  executed on the left margin of the ARMSim panel.\n- Added automatic scroll on simulation mode in order to keep the next\n  line that is going to be executed visible.\n- Improved the automatic selection of a mono spaced font (previously\n  selected font used ligatures).\n- Fixed an error on the Preferences Dialog which prevented to select\n  the ``ARMSim directory`` and the ``Gcc ARM command line`` using the\n  corresponding directory/file selector dialogs.\n- ARMSim: Fixed the simulation of shift instructions: only the 8 least\n  significant bits are now used to obtain the shift amount.\n- ARMSim.: Fixed the behavior when memory outside the current memory\n  map is accessed: each wrong access now raises a memory access error.\n- Bundled a reduced set of the GNU compiler toolchain. To reduce the\n  package size, only those files actually required to assemble an\n  assembly source code have been included.\n\n0.3.0 (2015-06-09)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- Migrated from PyQt to PySide to allow a simpler installation of\n  QtARMSim.\n- Developed a new source code editor based on QPlainTextEdit, though\n  removing the prior QScintilla dependency, which allows a simpler\n  installation of QtARMSim.\n- Improved the ARM Assembler syntax highlighting.\n\n0.2.7 (2014-11-05)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- Last revision of the first functional QtARMSim implementation. This\n  implementation  was used on the first semester of an introductory\n  course on Computer Architecture at Jaume I University. This is the\n  last version of that implementation, which used PyQt and QScintilla.\n\n\n",
