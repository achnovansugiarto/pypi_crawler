    "description": "Gitlib was originally developed as part of Smug, but it is useful as a\r\nstandalone library.  It provides a Pythonic API for creating, accessing, or\r\nmodifying a Git repository.  Many features in Gitlib are implemented in native\r\nPython, while others require running Git plumbing commands.  One of the primary\r\nadvantages of Gitlib is that it can perform operations on a bare repository that\r\nmight otherwise require a working tree.",
