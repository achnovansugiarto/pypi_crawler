The package is primarily focused on generating optimal designs for improved parameter estimation\nusing a relaxed formulation of the design optimization problem. Objectives in NLoed are primarily based\non the expected Fisher information matrix.\n\nNLoed is built on top of [Casadi](https://web.casadi.org/), an optimal control prototyping framework, and users of NLoed construct their models using Casadi's symbolic classes. Casadi's symbolic interface allows the user to encode a wide variety of nonlinear mathematical structures into their NLoed model. NLoed supports both static and dynamic nonlinear models including systems of nonlinear differential equations. Casadi also provides a number of numerical\ntools such as automatic differentiation and interfaces to nonlinear programming solvers, such as [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt),\nwhich greatly improve NLoed's performance.\n\nIn addition to design, NLoed provides a number of useful model-building tools including functions for maximum likelihood fitting, sensitivity analysis, data simulation, asymptotic and profile likelihoods, graphical identifiability diagnostics and quantification of prediction uncertainty. These tools, in conjunction with NLoed's core optimal design functionality, aim to provide a complete model building framework, enabling model construction, experimental design, model fitting and diagnostics to all be done within NLoed. This makes NLoed ideal for model builders heading into the lab or for those who wish to study model identifiability via simulation studies.\n\n### Disclaimer\nNLoed is still under development. A reasonable effort has been made to create a stable\nfunctional interface and to test the current release however, users should  proceed with reasonable \ncaution in writing code for publication or in developing other numerical tools using NLoed. The interface may be subject to change, especially in advance of the first non-beta (i.e. beta realeases are any that preceed version 1.0. Also, the authours make no guarantee for the absolute exahuastic correctness of all numerical routines implemented in NLoed (or its dependencies), and some reasonable testing of the package with the user's specific model, as well as some understanding of general OED theory are recommended when using the packag (especiall before version 1.0). If you identify any bugs or numerical issues, please submit them\nto the authours on Github, your error tickets are greatly appreciated! :) \n\n## Installation\nNLoed is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), so you can just use pip to install it!\nTo install with pip, run:\n```sh\npip install nloed\n```\n\nTaadaa! You are done! You can then test that it worked by starting up python and importing NLoed with;\n```sh\npython\n[something something something... python starts]\n>>>import nloed\n[no errors should be thrown]\n```\nAfter this it's a good idea to try some of the examples on Github.\n\n### Do I have Python installed?\nIf you've never used python or pip before, you may want to check a few things first before trying to\n install NLoed.\nFirst make sure you have python installed, its on your path, and the python version is appropriate.\nTo do this, run the following on the command line/prompt:\n```sh\npython -V\n```\nIt should print out a python version number which must be greater than 3.6.1. If this is susccesful,\nyou should also have pip installed by default (it ships with python >3.4), to confirm this run:\n```sh\npip -V\n```\nThis should print out a similar version number as the one python did.\n\n### How do I get the right version of Python/Pip installed?\nIf you don't have the right version of python on your system, you will need install it before\ninstalled NLoed. For those unfamiliar with Python, here are some helpful pointers depending on \nyour OS:\n\n#### OSX\nMacs ship with Python 2.7 by default which doesn't normally come with pip installed and isn't\ncompatible with NLoed anyways. \n\nThere are two simple options for getting Python >3.6.1 on your Mac:\n\n##### Use Homebrew\nThis is useful if you aren't doing much with Python other than NLoed, but it is a bit less flexible.\nSee the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) for details .\n\n* Make sure Xcode dependencies are installed (Homebrew needs these to do stuff):  \n    ```sh\n    xcode-select --install\n    ```\n* Install Homebrew, its a package manager for installing software on Macs:\n    ```sh\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n    ```\n* Check Homebrew is installed properly:\n    ```sh\n    brew --version\n    [should print out a version number]\n    ```\n* Install Python 3 with:\n    ```sh\n    brew install python3\n    ```\n* Check python 3 is installed with:\n    ```sh\n    python3 -V\n    ```\n* As the command 'python' points to the native 2.7 installed by default on your Mac, you will\nnow need to use 'python3' to start the newer version installed with Homebrew. To install NLoed on\nyour python 3 installation specifically, run:\n    ```sh\n    $ pip3 install nloed\n    ```\n    Here Homebrew has setup 'pip3' to replace 'pip' in order to avoid confusion.\n\n##### Use Pyenv\nThis method is better if you are going to do a lot of work in Python and want to organize many \nversions and dependencies. See the [pyenv Github](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for more details.\n\n* Make sure Homebrew is installed as above.\n* Run the following to install some needed dependencies;\n    ```sh\n    brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib\n    ```\n* Install pyenv either with  \n    a) Homebrew itself (with some changes to .bashrc and a shell restart):\n    ```sh\n    brew install pyenv\n    echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\\n  eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile\n    exec \"$SHELL\"\n    ```\n    b) The [auto-installer script]((https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)):..\n    ```sh\n    curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n    ```\n* Check pyenv is installed correctly:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv versions\n    [prints out some version, likely just 'system']\n    ```\n* Install a version of python greater than 3.6.1, for example:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv install 3.7.0\n    ```\n* You then need to make this new version active, the easiest way to do it is to make it the global default by running:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv global 3.7.0\n    ```\n    Note the version number here should be the same one you installed in the previous step.\n    Check you the pyenv documentation for more options for managing versions, it is very flexible.\n*   Finally install the NLoed package on the new pyenv version by running:\n    ```sh\n    pip install nloed\n    ```\n\n#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\nRecent releases of Ubuntu should come with a version of Python 3.\n* To check the version of Python 3 installed, in the terminal run:\n    ```sh\n    python3 -V\n    ```\n    This will print the version of the current Python 3 installation.\n* If the version printed above is greater than or equal to 3.6.1, you are good to go. Install NLoed by running the following:\n    ```sh\n    pip3 install nloed\n    ```\n    Note, the OS has your Python 3 install and corresponding pip command aliased to 'python3' and 'pip3' to avoid confusion with any Python 2 installations on the same system. Use these commands going forward.\n* If the version printed in the first step is less than 3.6.1, you will need to install an newer version of Python 3. The easiest way to do this is likely using pyenv. To install pyenv, first get the depenencies by running:\n    ```sh\n    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \\\n    libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \\\n    xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git\n    ```\n* Now use the [auto-installer script](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) and restart the shell:\n    ```sh\n    curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n    exec \"$SHELL\"\n    ```\n* Check pyenv is installed correctly:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv versions\n    [prints out some version, likely just 'system']\n    ```\n* Install a version of python greater than 3.6.1, for example:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv install 3.7.0\n    ```\n* You then need to make this new version active, the easiest way to do it is to make it the global default by running:\n    ```sh\n    pyenv global 3.7.0\n    ```\n    Note the version number here should be the same one you installed in the previous step.\n    Check you the pyenv documentation for more options for managing versions, it is very flexible.\n*   Finally install the NLoed package on the new pyenv version by running:\n    ```sh\n    pip install nloed\n    ```\n\n#### Windows\nIf you are using Windows 10, its likely you do not have Python available in the command prompt by default.\n\n* Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the desired Python version's installer.\n* Run the installer .exe and follow its prompts. Make sure you check the box 'Add Python 3.X to Path' so that the installed Python version will be available from the command prompt. This option is on the first page of the installer.\n* Once the install is complete, open the command prompt and install NLoed with pip by running:\n    ```sh\n    pip install nloed\n    ```\n\n## Dependencies & Versions\nNLoed requires Python 3.6.1 or newer, Python 2 is not supported.\n\nNLoed uses the following (direct) dipendencies and has been tested with the versions indicated below:\n* Casadi>=3.5.0\n* Numpy>=1.17.0\n* Pandas>=1.0.0\n* Scipy\n* Matplotlib\n\n## Usage\nNLoed consistes of two core classes: the Model class and the Design class. NLoed's basic workflow involves\nconstrucing a Model class instance to encode a user's mathematical model and then creating a Design\ninstance encoding an experimental design for the given Model. Use of the Model and Design class\ncan be done iterativly, as Model parameters and assumptions are refined after succesive experiments.\nThe majority of input and output data for NLoed is handled via Pandas dataframes, which makes\nit easy to import data and export designs or simulations to third-party software. \n\n### Models\nThe Model class is used to encode all aspects of a model, connecting model inputs, parameters and\nobservation variables via the model equations and the assumed distributions of the observations variables.\nThe NLoed Model class supports multi-input, multi-output models with a variety possible error distributions, including those for postively skewed, binary and count observation data types. Modelling of\nobservation hetroskedasticity is also supported, however a this time all observations are assumed to\nbe independent. The Model class also enables some analysis tools including; fitting, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, confidence intervals, fitting diagnostics, data simulation\nand generating model predictions.\n\n### Designs\nThe Design class in NLoed is used to generate optimal designs subject tp various objectives and constraints specified by the user. Users pass their Model class instance into the Design class to generate an archetypal (relaxed) design for their model. Optimization of the design can be structured in a variety of ways depending on the design contraints and numerical considerations. The resulting Design class instance can then be used provides the\nuser with functionality to generate a variety of implementable (exact) designs with a desired sample\nsize. \n\nFurther examples can be found in the \\example folder on NLoed's Github. A full description of the OED background, NLoed's use cases and function call formats can be found in the \\docs folder on Github.\n\n## Contributing\nNLoed is maintained by the [Ingalls Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/bingalls/), in the Department of Applied Math, at the University of Waterloo.\n\nInquiries about contributions and usage can be directed to [Brian Ingalls](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/brian-ingalls) at bingalls[at]uwaterloo.ca \n\nA detailed guide to setting a development environment for NLoed can be found in DevGuide.md on Github\n\nIssues and feature suggestions can be submitted through Github.\n\n## Credits\nNLoed was written by Nathan Braniff and Brian Ingalls.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n* Michael Astwood for early prototyping of the project\n* Zixuan Liu and Taylor Pearce for testing some experimental designs generated by NLoed in the wetlab\n\n## License\nThis software is released under the GNU Lesser Public Liscence V3\n\n\n",
