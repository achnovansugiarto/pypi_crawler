    "description": "TANGO (Trustable Algorithms for Nonlinear General Optimization) is a set of \r\nFortran routines for Optimization developed at the Department of Applied \r\nMathematics of the State University of Campinas and at the Department of \r\nComputer Science of the University of São Paulo, under the coordination of \r\nProfessor J. M. Martínez. Only well-established methods are included. The \r\ncodes are easy to use and require minimum previous knowledge. On-line support \r\nis provided.\r\n\r\nALGENCAN: Fortran code for general nonlinear programming that does not use\r\nmatrix manipulations at all and, so, is able to solve extremely large problems\r\nwith moderate computer time. The general algorithm is of Augmented Lagrangian\r\ntype and the subproblems are solved using GENCAN. GENCAN (included in \r\nALGENCAN) is a Fortran code for minimizing a smooth function with a \r\npotentially large number of variables and box-constraints. ALGENCAN has \r\ninterfaces with AMPL, C/C++, CUTEr, Matlab, Python, Octave and R (statistical \r\ncomputing).",
