List/start/stop processes in \n  the guest system.\n- Create and delete snapshots\n- Get hosts statistics and monitor performance\n\nAn of course, you can use it to access all the vSphere API through python.\n\nIt's built upon a slightly modified version of ZSI_ (that comes bundled-in) \nwhich makes it really fast in contrast to other python SOAP libraries that don't\nprovide code generation.\n\n.. _ZSI: http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe simplest way is using setuptools_' easy_install:\n\n.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n\n::\n\n  easy_install -U pysphere\n\nOr using the pip_:\n\n.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n\n::\n\n  pip install -U pysphere\n\nYou can aslo find the source package and windows installer in the downloads_ \nsection. To install it from the source package:\n\n.. _downloads: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/downloads/list\n\n1. Unzip the package\n2. run: ``python setup.py install``\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\nHere's how you power on a virtual machine. See also the `getting started`_ guide\nand the project's wiki_ with the full documentation.\n\n.. _getting started: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/wiki/GettingStarted\n.. _wiki: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/w/list\n\n>>> from pysphere import VIServer\n>>> server = VIServer()\n>>> server.connect(\"my.esx.host.com\", \"myusername\", \"secret\")\n>>> vm = server.get_vm_by_path(\"[datastore] path/to/file.vmx\")\n>>> vm.power_on()\n>>> print vm.get_status()\nPOWERED ON\n\nDiscussion Group\n----------------\n\nYou can find a lot more examples and use cases in the `discussion group`_\n\n.. _discussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/pysphere\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, Sebastian Tello\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n    this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n    this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n    and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n  * Neither the name of copyright holders nor the names of its contributors\n    may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n    without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
