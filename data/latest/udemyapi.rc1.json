If you have any questions/troubles, you can use Issues to let me know.\n\n## About\n#### udemyAPI developed for udemy teachers. It helps you to monitor your course. You can monitor the questions in your course with this library.  \n#### Mail:AzizKpln@protonmail.com\n#### LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/aziz-k-074604170/\n\n## Importing The Modules\n```\nfrom udemyAPI.UdemyQuestionsAnswers import UdemyQuestionAnswers\nfrom udemyAPI import apiConfigTeachingAssistant\nfrom udemyAPI import apiConfigStandard\nfrom udemyAPI.playwrightSetup import setupPlaywright\nfrom udemyAPI.udemyLogin import login\nfrom udemyAPI.teachingAssistant import teachingAssistantReports\n```\n\n### setting up playwright\n```\npwPage=setupPlaywright()._page_()\n```\n### Logging in Udemy\n```\nlogin(pwPage,<email>,<password>)\n```\n>-    If you don't want your password to be seen in the script that you're writing,\n>-    You can setup a virtual environment. You can search about it if you don't know how to.\n\n\n## configuration of udemyAPI teaching assistant\n```\napiConfig=apiConfigTeachingAssistant(pwPage,<course_link>,<language>,<teaching_assistant_name>)\n```\n> apiConfigTeachingAssistant returns;\n>-    Links of questions that's answered by a spesific teaching assistant in a spesific time.\n>-    Links of questions that's unanswered by a spesific teaching assistant in a spesific time.\n>-    Comments that's been made by a spesific teaching assistant in a spesific time.\n\n>first argument takes the playwright setup variable\n\n>the second one takes the course link(the link in student panel)\n\n>the third option is the language. EN and TR supported. It's the language of your udemy panel\n\n>the last option takes the teaching assistant name.\n\n## using the API for apiConfigTeachingAssistant\n```\nuAPI=teachingAssistantReports(apiConfig)\n```\n> teachingAssistantReports inherits the values that you've written in apiConfigTeachingAssistant.\n> therefore you have to use the variable 'apiConfig' inside of teachingAssistantReports function.\n```\nuAPI._teachingAssistantReports_(5)\n```\n> To recieve the reports, use the function above and give a day. The code above returns the 5 days reports for teaching assistant \"Aziz\"\n```\nprint(\"Comments By Assistant:\",uAPI.commentsByTeachingAssistant)\n```\n> uAPI.commentsByTeachingAssistant used to receive the comments that's been made by the teaching assistant\n```\nprint(\"Answered:\",uAPI.getLinksAnswered)\n```\n> uAPI.getLinksAnswered used to receive the links that's been answered by the teaching assistant\n```\nprint(\"UnAnswered:\",uAPI.getLinksUnAnswered)\n```\n> uAPI.getLinksUnAnswered used to receive the links that's NOT been answered by the teaching assistant\n\n```\nprint(len(uAPI.getLinksUnAnswered))\n```\n> you can also use the len() python function to recieve the length of answered/unanswered questions.\n\n\n## configuration of udemyAPI Standard function\n```\napiConfig=apiConfigStandard(pwPage,<course_link>,<language>)\n```\n> apiConfigStandard returns;\n>-    Questions that's not been read by anyone.\n>-    Questions that's not been answered by anyone.\n>-    Questions that's not been answered by any teaching assistant\n>- - -  (the difference is in here it looks for every teaching assistant in the course, but above, it looks for a spesific teaching assistant.)\n\n>first argument takes the playwright setup variable\n\n>the second one takes the course link(the link in teaching assistant panel)\n\n>the last option is the language. EN and TR supported. It's the language of your udemy panel\n\n## using the API for apiConfigStandard\n```\nuAPI=UdemyQuestionAnswers(apiConfig)\n```\n> UdemyQuestionAnswers inherits the values that you've written in apiConfigStandard.\n> therefore you have to use the variable 'apiConfig' inside of UdemyQuestionAnswers function.\n```\nuAPI.courseID=3\n```\n<img width=\"45%\" src=\"https://images2.imgbox.com/e7/d1/8WLJ5K86_o.png\">\n\n> courseID takes the ID number of course. For the courses above;\n\n> 1 means all courses\n\n> 2 means etik hacker olma kursu\n\n> 3 means etik hacker olma kursu seviye 2\n```\nuAPI.unAnsweredQuestions(5)\n```\n> the code above is used to get unanswered questions in 5 days by anyone\n```\nuAPI.noAnswerByTeacingAssistants(5)\n```\n> the code above is used to get unanswered questions in 5 days by any teaching assistants\n```\nuAPI.unReadQuestions(5)\n```\n> the code above is used to get unread questions in 5 days by any teaching assistants\n```\nprint(uAPI.getLinks)\n```\n> the code above used for getting links\n```\nprint(len(uAPI.getLinks))\n```\n> you can use the len() function to see the number of links\n\n",
