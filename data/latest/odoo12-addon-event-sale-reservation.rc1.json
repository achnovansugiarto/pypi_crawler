Install ``web_ir_actions_act_multi`` from https://github.com/OCA/web\n#. Install ``web_ir_actions_act_view_reload`` from https://github.com/OCA/web\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n\nTo make use of this module, a user needs these minimal permissions:\n\n- Sales / User: Own Documents Only\n- Events / User\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo know how many reservations exist for a given event type:\n\n#. Go to *Events > Configuration > Event Categories* and pick or create one.\n#. There's a new smart button called *Reserved seats* with that count.\n#. Click on it to get to the sales orders where the seats got reserved.\n\nBut that counter will be probably zero when you install, so let's see how to\nincrease it.\n\nTo create an event reservation product:\n\n#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*.\n#. Create one.\n#. Set its basic info (name, price...) and go to *Sales* tab.\n#. Under *Events*, tick *Is an event reservation*.\n#. Select one *Event type for reservations*.\n#. Save.\n\nFrom now on, you can sell event reservations for that event type. To do it:\n\n#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations*.\n#. Create one.\n#. Set its basic info (customer, date...) and go to *Order lines* tab.\n#. Click *Add a product*.\n#. Select the event reservation product you created above.\n#. Set its info (quantity, price...).\n#. Save that line and the quotation.\n\nAt this point, the reservation is not yet confirmed, so if you go to the event\ntype, the smart button will still count zero.\n\nTo confirm those reservations:\n\n#. Go to the quotation you just created (if you are not there yet).\n#. Click on *Confirm*.\n\nNow, if you go to the event type form, the smart button will indicate how many\nreserved seats exist.\n\nIf you want to convert those reservations into real event registrations:\n\n#. Go to the quotation you just created (if you are not there yet).\n#. Click on *Register in event*.\n#. In the wizard you see, set the *Event* and *Event Ticket* for all the order\n   lines you want to convert into registrations.\n#. If there is any line you still don't want to convert, remove it from the\n   wizard.\n#. Click on *Next*.\n#. A new wizard will appear, where you will be able to specify the name, email\n   and phone of each one of the attendees. If you don't do it, they will get\n   that info from the sales order customer.\n#. After that's done, click on *Apply*.\n\nAt this point, the sales order lines will be modified to include the ticket\nproduct instead of the reservation product, and the event reservations have\nbeen created, linked to those lines.\n\nIf the ticket was free, the registrations are confirmed. Otherwise, they are\nkept as draft until an invoice is created for the sales order, and paid. But\nthat is just upstream ``event_sale`` module in action.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/event/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/event/issues/new?body=module:%20event_sale_reservation%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Jairo Llopis <jairo.llopis@tecnativa.com> (https://www.tecnativa.com/)\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-Yajo| image:: https://github.com/Yajo.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/Yajo\n    :alt: Yajo\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-Yajo| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/event <https://github.com/OCA/event/tree/12.0/event_sale_reservation>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
