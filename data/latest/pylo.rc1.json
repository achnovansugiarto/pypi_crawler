    "description": "# PyLo\n\n![PyLo measurement series start](docs/pylo-promotion.gif)\n\nPyLo is a Python module and program for recording Lorentz-TEM image series.\n\nThe software is written for the JEOL NeoArm F200 with Gatan Microscopy Suite as the \ndisplaying software but can be extended to use any microscope. Also it comes with a \ncommand line view, that does not need Gatan Microscopy Suite.\n\nPyLo provides an easy to understand GUI to create highly customizable measurement series \nto automatically record changes in magnetic orders. With the JEOL NeoArm F200, PyLo allows\ncreating series over the tilt in x and y direction, the (de-)focus and the magnetic field\napplied by activating the objective lenses.\n\nPyLo is easily extended. It provides an Event system to hook in before or after specific\nactions. It allows to use and change all settings at any time. Also it provides an easy to \nuse settings manager where plugins can add their settings which will be shown to the user \nbefore every measurement run. Microscopes and cameras can be customized or replaced by \ncreating own classes that implement an interface. Those classes can be loaded dynamically.\nThis way PyLo can deal with every microscope and camera without having to learn the whole\nprogram code. \n\n**Key Features**:\n\n1. Record LTEM image series automatically (e.g. field series + focus series for induction maps)\n2. Integration in [Gatan Microscopy Suite Software](https://www.gatan.com/products/tem-analysis/gatan-microscopy-suite-software)\n3. Alternative Command Line Interface\n4. Adaptable for all TEMs and connected camera systems\n5. Easily extendable parameter control\n6. Plug-In and Event system integrated\n1. Offline installation possible\n\n## Installation\n\n### GMS (Internet connection required)\n\nFor PyLo with the GMS integration, follow the instructions in the \n[PyLo GMS Frontend](https://github.com/miile7/pylo-gms) repository.\n\n### Command line interface (Internet connection required)\n\nFor the command line installation install Python (<https://www.python.org/>). \n\nThen use \n```cmd\npython -m pip install pylo\n```\nto install PyLo.\n\nAfter [installing the devices](#install-devices) (camera and microscope) you can start \nPyLo by invoking\n```cmd\npython -m pylo\n```\n\n### Install devices\n\n> **TL;DR**: Download `devices/` directory and `devices.ini`, move to both files to\n> `%programfiles%\\Gatan\\Plugins\\` for the GMS installation and to `%username%\\pylo\\`\n> for windows or to `~/pylo/` for Unix CLI installation.\n\nIn PyLo the microscope and the camera (and potential other hardware machines) are called \n\"devices\". Those are loaded on runtime and can be selected by the users. Devices are \ndefined in python standalone files that are not integrated in the PyLo source code. They \nare installed by adding their definitions to the `devices.ini` file(s) which can be \nlocated at various places.\n\nPyLo offers 3 cameras and 3 microscopes:\n1. Cameras\n  1. Digital Micrograph Camera: Any camara that can be used in Gatans Microscopy Suite (only\n    usable in GMS mode)\n  2. Dummy Camera: A camera that creates images filled with random pixel data (for testing)\n  3. PyJEM Camera: A camera using JEOLs `PyJEM` library (not well tested)\n2. Microscopes\n  1. Digital Micrograph Microscope: Any microscope that can be used in Gatans Microscopy\n     Suite (only usable in GMS mode)\n  2. Dummy Microscope: A microscope that has a focus measurement variable, an objectiv \n     lens current variable and a pressure variable that can be modified, each change in \n     one of those values does nothing (for testing)\n  3. PyJEM Microscope: A microscope using JEOLs `PyJEM` library (not well tested)\nTo install those, download the `devices` directory and the `devices.ini` file. Move them \ninto one of the devices directories listed below. To prevent one device showing up, you \ncan either delete the python file or set the `disabled` value in the `devices.ini` to `No`.\n\nPyLo will look for `devices.ini` files in the following locations. If there are multiple \nfiles, all of them are used. If there are multiple devices with the same name, the file\nfound first is used (not the order below):\n1. The program data directory, Windows: `%username%\\pylo\\`, Unix: `~/pylo/`\n   (**recommended for CLI installation**, create if necessary)\n2. The current user directory, Windows: `%username%`, Unix: `~/`\n3. The current working directory (the directory PyLo is executed in)\n4. *GMS only:* GMS \"plugin\" directory, Windows: `%programfiles%\\Gatan\\Plugins`\n   (**recommended for GMS installation**, create if necessary)\n5. *GMS only:* GMS \"application\" directory, Windows: `%programfiles%\\Gatan`\n\n### Manual installation (No Internet connection needed)\n\nTo install PyLo manually [download this repository](/archive/master.zip) and extract it. \n\nFor executing PyLo in GMS, move the `pylo-master` directory to \n`%programfiles\\Gatan\\Plugins`. Now open the `pylo-gms` directory. Follow the installation \ninstructions from the [PyLo GMS Frontend](https://github.com/miile7/pylo-gms) installation \nbut use the files from the `pylo-gms` directory instead of downloading files (the files to\ndownload are the files in the `pylo-gms` directory).\n\nFor the command line usage move the extracted `pylo-master` directory anywhere \n(`%userdata%` recommended for Windows, `~` recommended for Unix). Open the command line,\nmove to this directory and start pylo by invoking it as a module:\n\n**Windows**\n```cmd\ncd %userdata%\\pylo-master\\\npython -m pylo\n```\n\n**Unix**\n```bash\ncd ~/pylo-master\npython -m pylo\n```\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nPyLo is written with python 3.5.6+ (tested with 3.5.6 and 3.7.1).\n\n- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), \n  [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy))\n- [PIL (Pillow)](https://python-pillow.org/) \n  ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/), \n  [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pillow))\n- [execdmscript](https://github.com/miile7/execdmscript)\n  ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/execdmscript/))\n\nNote that the devices may need more libraries.\n\n",
