As of right now the basics are there, however its still very much work in progress.  \nYou should have no issues using the package as showing in the Usage section below. However bugs and other issues may show up.\n\n### All info is pulled from PokéAPI  \nThat means the info provided by cyndaquil is as accurate as the info on PokéAPI.\nIf you do find any error in the data provided please open an issue on the [PokéAPI github page](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokedex/issues)\n\n\n## Python Versions\n----\nThis module has been tested on the following Python 3 versions: \n- 3.9.8 \n- 3.9.9 \n- 3.10.1\n\nIt has not yet been tested on older version of Python 3. You mileage may vary if using on any versions not listed above.\nAs additional versions of Python are tested they will be added to list of working versions.\n\n\n## Installation\n----\nInstallation is done through pip. Run the pip command below to install module.  \n\n```\npip install cyndaquil\n```\n\n### What if that doesn't work?  \nMake sure you are using Python 3. You may also need to use `pip3` instead of just `pip` to do the install.\nIf you are using Python 3.9 or 3.10 you may need to use`pip3.9` or `pip3.10` respectfully.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n----\nAll the dependencies for this module should install when you run the above install command.\nHowever if for some reason dependencies are missing, they are listed below, along with their install methods\n\n- Python Requests `pip install requests`\n\n\n## Usage\n----\nThis module provides a very class based lookup method for Pokemon, Berries and Items. \nBelow is a simple example of what you can use the program for.\n\n```python\nimport cyndaquil as cy\n\n#Create a Pokemon Object\ncyndaquil = cy.Pokemon('cyndaquil')\n\n#Create an item Object\npokeball = cy.Item('poke-ball')\n\n#Create an berry Object\nchesto = cy.Berry('chesto')\n\n\nprint(\"Cyndaquil's pokedex number is:\", cyndaquil.number)\nprint(\"The Pokeball cost:\", pokeball.cost)\nprint(\"The Chesto berry's firmness is:\", chesto.firmness)\n```\n\n### Output\n```\nCyndaquil's pokedex number is: 155\nThe Pokeball cost: 200\nThe Chesto berry's firmness is: super-hard\n```\n\n## What info can I look up?\n----\nI tried to include as much info as I could. However, a few things are still missing.\nBelow is a list of all the info you can currently pull from PokéAPI with cyndaquil\n\n### Pokemon\n- Pokedex Number\n- Type\n- Ability (including hidden abilities)\n- Catch Rate\n- Level rate group\n- weight (in Kilos)\n- height (in Meters)\n- Base Stats\n- EV yield\n- Base Experience\n- Base Friendship\n- Pokedex color\n- The Pokemon this evolves from, if any\n- Egg Groups\n\n### Item\n- ID number\n- Cost\n- Attribute (Describes the type of item, and how you can use it)\n- Category (Generally the pocket its in, but some are more specific)\n- Effect. This is a long description of the item's usage\n- Short Effect. This is a short, more concise description of the item\n- Fling Power\n- Fling Effect\n- Wild Pokemon that holds this pokemon (Currently only lists the first Pokemon on the list)\n\n### Berry\n- ID Number\n- Flavor Potency (Currently using Gen IV potency values)\n- Size (in Centimeters)\n- Smoothness\n- Natural Gift Power\n- Natural Gift Type\n- Max Harvest (Max number of berries per tree)\n- Item attributes for the berry\n\n\n## Whats next?\n----\nThe goals for this project are to make it an all in one look up for any info listed on PokéAPI. This includes things like type, abilities, sprites and much much more.\n\n### Roadmap\nBelow is a general roadmap of planned features and ucyates. \n- List all held by Pokemon for items and berries\n- Allow look up of sprites for Pokemon\n- Allow look up of sprites for Items\n- Allow look up of sprites for Berries\n- Allow look up of evolution tree for Pokemon\n- Allow look up of abilities and types\n- Allow look up of moves\n- Allow look up of movesets\n- Include info on status conditions (This will probably be hard coded as PokéAPI does not have this info)\n\n",
