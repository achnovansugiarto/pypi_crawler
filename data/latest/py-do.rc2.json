However, It has the following inconveniences:\n\n* It uses a plaintext file as data storage.\n* It stores the data in a non standard way in different files.\n* It's written in C, which I don't speak.\n* It's development has come to [code maintenance\n    only](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/graphs/code-frequency).\n* There are many issues with how it handles\n    [recurrence](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/design/recurrence.html).\n* It doesn't have [friendly task\n    identifiers](https://lyz-code.github.io/pydo/developing/sulids).\n* There is no way of accessing the task time tracking from the python library.\n\nAnd lacks the following features:\n\n* Native Kanban or Scrum support.\n* Task estimations.\n* Easy report creation.\n* Easy way to manage the split of a task in subtasks.\n* Freezing of recurrent tasks.\n\nMost of the above points can be addressed through the [Taskwarrior plugin\nsystem](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/3rd-party.html) or\n[udas](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/udas.html), but sometimes it's difficult to\naccess the data or as the database grows, the performance drops so quick that it\nmakes them unusable.\n\n[tasklite](https://tasklite.org) is a promising project that tackles most of the\npoints above. But as it's written in\n[Haskel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29),\nI won't be able to add support for the features I need.\n\n# A quick demonstration\n\nLet's see `pydo` in action. We'll first add three tasks to our list.\n\n```bash\n$: pydo add Buy milk\n  [+] Added task 0: Buy milk\n$: pydo add Buy eggs\n  [+] Added task 1: Buy eggs\n$: pydo add Bake cake\n  [+] Added task 2: Bake cake\n```\n\nNow let's see the list.\n\n```bash\n$: pydo list\n     ╷\n  ID │ Description\n╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸\n  0  │ Buy milk\n  1  │ Buy eggs\n  2  │ Bake cake\n     ╵\n```\n\nSuppose we bought our ingredients and wish to mark the first two tasks as done.\n\n```bash\n$: pydo do 0 1\n  [+] Closed task 0: Buy milk with state done\n  [+] Closed task 1: Buy eggs with state done\n\n$: pydo list\n     ╷\n  ID │ Description\n╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸\n  2  │ Bake cake\n     ╵\n```\n\nThose are the first three features, the `add`, `list` and `done` commands, but\nthey represent all you need to know, to get started with `pydo`.\n\nBut there are hundreds of other features, so if you learn more, you can do more.\nIt's entirely up to you to choose how you use `pydo`. Stick to the\nthree commands above, or learn about sophisticated agile support, custom reports,\nuser defined metadata and more.\n\n# Install\n\nTo install pydo, run:\n\n```bash\npip install py-do\n```\n\nThe installation method will create a new pydo database at\n`~/.local/share/pydo/database.tinydb`.\n\n`pydo` reads it's configuration from the yaml file located at\n`~/.local/share/pydo/config.yaml`. The [default\ntemplate](https://github.com/lyz-code/pydo/blob/master/assets/config.yaml) is\nprovided at installation time.\n\n# What's next?\n\nProbably the most important next step is to start using `pydo`.\nCapture your tasks, don't try to remember them. Review your task list to keep it\ncurrent. Consult your task list to guide your actions. Develop the habit.\n\nIt doesn't take long until you realize that you might want to change your\nworkflow. Perhaps you are missing due dates, and need more defined deadlines.\nPerhaps you need to make greater use of tags to help you filter tasks\ndifferently. You'll know if your workflow is not helping you as much as it\ncould.\n\nThis is when you might look closer at the\n[docs](https://lyz-code.github.io/pydo) and the recommended Best Practices.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the project follow [this\nguidelines](https://lyz-code.github.io/pydo/contributing).\n\nWelcome to `pydo`.\n\n\n",
