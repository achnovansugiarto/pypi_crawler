    "description": "#########\npkgsample\n#########\n\n.. This file is the documentation for how to use this pkgsample repo.\n.. You will replace it with your own file.\n\nThis is an example demonstrating how to package your code for distribution on\nPyPI.  It is **one possible way** to do it in the fall of 2022.  I am not going\nto discuss other ways it could be done. The packaging ecosystem is complex.\nTalking about all the options just confuses things.\n\nThis repo isn't meant to show all of the configuration in a typical project.\nFor example, it has no tests, it has no docs, it doesn't use linters or type\ncheckers.  Those are good things, you should look into them, but this repo is\nonly about packaging a project for distribution, and leaves out those other\ngood things so we can focus on the packaging.\n\nThe files in this repo have comments throughout, to help you understand what\ndoes what, so that you can create your own files with the parts and the details\nthat you need.\n\n\nHow to use this repo\n====================\n\nYou have code you want to distribute.  This repo is a model of how you can\nconfigure your project.  Make a copy of the files here, take the parts that you\nneed, and leave out the parts you don't.\n\n\nDecisions\n---------\n\nYou need to make a few decisions before getting started.\n\nProject name\n............\n\nYou have to pick a name for your project.  In this repo, it's \"pkgsample\", but\nyou will choose a different name.  Your project name will serve a few different\nfunctions: it will be the module name for importing, the name of the repo, and\nalso the name on PyPI. Anywhere you see \"pkgsample,\" you will change it to your\nproject name.\n\nSince the project name will be the name on PyPI, you should check to see if\nyour desired name is available there before making a decision.  `Search for\nyour name on PyPI <pypi_>`_ to see if it's already taken.\n\nVersion number\n..............\n\nThe version number of your package is in src/pkgsample/__init__.py as the\n``__version__`` variable.  You will update this value when making a\ndistribution.  See the note in \"Upload a test\" below about using .devN suffixes\ninitially.\n\nOptional features\n.................\n\nThis layout will install your modules so that people can import them.  There\nis also an extra possibility included:\n\n- You might have commands you need to install so that your users have new\n  command-line tools. These parts are marked with ``COMMANDS:``.\n\nKeep an eye out as you look through the files to understand what you can omit\nif you don't need this option.\n\nProject details\n...............\n\nThere are other details that you might want to change, but you don't have to:\n\n- License: this repo uses the Apache license, but you can choose a different\n  one.\n\n- Minimum Python version: this repo required Python 3.9 or greater. Perhaps you\n  need to support more versions (choose a lower requirement) or you want to use\n  some newer Python features (choose a higher requirement).\n\nComments throughout the files, especially in pyproject.toml show where to make\nthese choices, and link to resources that can help.\n\n\nWhat's in the repo\n==================\n\nThis repo is a demonstration of making a distributable package.  You should\nexamine the files here, decide which are right for you, and adapt them to your\nneeds.\n\nsrc/\n----\n\nThis directory is where you put your code. It should have one subdirectory\nnamed for your project, and all of your work goes into that subdirectory.\n\nThis repo has a few small files in src/pkgsample just to have something to\nbuild and distribute. You will delete that directory and make a new\nsubdirectory for your files.\n\npyproject.toml\n--------------\n\nThis is the heart of the process. You will be making lots of changes in this\nfile.  The metadata about your project (name, description, author, and so on)\nare all specified here as well as many other details.\n\nREADME.rst\n----------\n\n(This file!) You will replace this file with your own README.rst describing\nyour project, how to install it, how to use it, how to get help, the\n`changelog`_, and so on.\n\nBits and bobs\n-------------\n\n**.gitignore** is a standard git file that keeps uninteresting files from being\nstored in git.\n\n**LICENSE.txt** is the text of your chosen license.\n\nSome files here are not needed to get a project distributed, but are useful for\nme in this repo, and you might find useful also:\n\n- **Makefile**: organizes the commands needed to work in the repo.  The\n  commands shown in this README are also available as targets in the Makefile.\n  You can use ``make help`` to see the targets and what they do.\n\n- **.editorconfig**: specifies simple formatting rules that your editor can\n  enforce.\n\n\nPreparing your environment\n==========================\n\nGet yourself a Python 3.9 environment.  Using a `virtualenv`_ is recommended\nbut not required.\n\nYou'll need a few tools to build the installable files (called distributions).\nThey are specified in the dev-requirements.txt file. Install them with pip::\n\n    python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n    # or:  make tools\n\n\nMake your changes\n=================\n\nIf you are ready, you can make all your project changes.  If you want, you can\nalso skip this step to try some of the next steps with the pkgsample repo as it\nis, to see what happens.\n\nCopy the files from this repo, then make all your changes:\n\n- Put your project's source files in the src/ directory.  Make sure to remove\n  all traces of the pkgsample code.\n\n- Update the pyproject.toml file with all your chosen details.  The word\n  \"pkgsample\" shouldn't appear in it at all when you are done.\n\n- Completely re-write the README.rst file with the description and details of\n  your project.\n\n\nInstall locally\n===============\n\nYou can do some preliminary testing of your project by installing it as an\n\"editable install\" in your current environment::\n\n    python -m pip install -e .\n\nThis will make your project importable in your current Python, and you can try\nrunning your code.  Here's an example using the pkgsample code::\n\n    % python\n    Python 3.9.15 (main, Oct 24 2022, 17:23:01)\n    >>> from pkgsample.add import add\n    >>> add(17, 42)\n    59\n\nIf you are creating command-line commands, you will be able to run them now::\n\n    % pkgsample_add 1 2 3 4 5\n    Your numbers are: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    They add up to: 15\n\nBy the way, an editable install like this is also a good way to do development,\nbecause Python will import directly from the files you are editing in your\nworking tree, so it's quick to make changes and see their effect.\n\nOnce you do this, you will start seeing ``__pycache__`` directories near your\ncode.  These contain compiled bytecode files, named something.something.pyc.\nYou can safely delete these files, and the .gitignore file will keep them from\nbeing stored in git.\n\n\nMaking distributions\n====================\n\nYou're ready to make installable artifacts, called distributions.\n\nCreate the files\n----------------\n\nThese commands will make the files and check them for correctness::\n\n    python -m build --sdist --wheel\n\tpython -m twine check dist/*\n    # or:  make clean dist\n\nIf all went well, you will now have a dist/ directory with two files::\n\n    pkgsample-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl\n    pkgsample-0.1.0.tar.gz\n\nThe .whl file is a \"wheel\".  This is the preferred file format for\ndistributions.  The .tar.gz file is a \"source distribution\" (sdist), which is\nalso easy to provide, and is preferred by some users.\n\nIf something went wrong, the ``twine check`` command reported errors to fix.\nIt might help to see what is in the files, or you are just curious.  You can\nexamine the contents::\n\n    % tar tvfz dist/*.tar.gz\n    drwxr-xr-x  0 user group       0 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group   10177 Nov 15 05:07 pkgsample-0.1.0/LICENSE.txt\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group   19222 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/PKG-INFO\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group    6866 Nov 15 06:24 pkgsample-0.1.0/README.rst\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group    2860 Nov 15 05:28 pkgsample-0.1.0/pyproject.toml\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group      38 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/setup.cfg\n    drwxr-xr-x  0 user group       0 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/\n    drwxr-xr-x  0 user group       0 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample/\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group     246 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample/__init__.py\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group     166 Nov 15 05:07 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample/add.py\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group     410 Nov 15 05:07 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample/add_cli.py\n    drwxr-xr-x  0 user group       0 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group   19222 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/PKG-INFO\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group     333 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/SOURCES.txt\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group       1 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/dependency_links.txt\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group     113 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/entry_points.txt\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group       5 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/requires.txt\n    -rw-r--r--  0 user group      10 Nov 15 06:25 pkgsample-0.1.0/src/pkgsample.egg-info/top_level.txt\n\nThe distribution includes all of your files, and also new supporting files made\nas part of the packaging process.\n\n\nTesting the distributions\n-------------------------\n\nYou can test installing the distribution files.  Make a new virtualenv, and\ninstall directly from one of the files::\n\n    python -m pip install /path/to/pkgsample-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl\n\nNow you should be able to import and run your modules.\n\nCleaning up\n-----------\n\nThe dist/ and build/ directories are created as part of this process.  They\nwon't be stored in git and you can delete them whenever you want to clean up.\nThe Makefile includes a target to do this for you::\n\n    make clean\n\n\nUploading to PyPI\n=================\n\nThe final step to making a complete installable package is to upload your\ndistributions to the `Python Package Index, PyPI <pypi_>`_.  This is where pip\nfinds packages to install.\n\n(If you've been trying these steps with the pkgsample repo unchanged, you won't\nbe able to do this, because you can't upload new pkgsample distributions.)\n\nThere are actually two PyPI instances: the real one at https://pypi.org, and\nalso a test one at https://test.pypi.org/ for you to try out distributions\nbefore publishing them for real.\n\nCreate accounts\n---------------\n\nRegister two PyPI accounts, at both https://pypi.org/account/register/ and\nhttps://test.pypi.org/account/register/.  PyPI has a number of options to keep\nyour account secure, but a simple username and password will get you started.\n\nUpload a test\n-------------\n\nUpload your distributions to test.pypi.org.  The twine tool does this::\n\n    python -m twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*\n    # or: make clean dist test_pypi\n\nYou will be prompted for your username and password, the progress will be\ndisplayed, and finally you'll get a URL to see what your published package page\nwill look like::\n\n    % python -m twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*\n    Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n    INFO     dist/pkgsample-0.1.1.dev0-py3-none-any.whl (10.4 KB)\n    INFO     dist/pkgsample-0.1.1.dev0.tar.gz (10.6 KB)\n    INFO     Querying keyring for username\n    Enter your username: your_username\n    INFO     Querying keyring for password\n    Enter your password:\n    INFO     username: your_username\n    INFO     password: <hidden>\n    Uploading pkgsample-0.1.1.dev0-py3-none-any.whl\n    100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 26.6/26.6 kB • 00:00 • 13.1 MB/s\n    INFO     Response from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/:\n             200 OK\n    Uploading pkgsample-0.1.1.dev0.tar.gz\n    100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 26.7/26.7 kB • 00:00 • 27.1 MB/s\n    INFO     Response from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/:\n             200 OK\n\n    View at:\n    https://test.pypi.org/project/pkgsample/0.1.1.dev0/\n\n**Note:** Once you upload a file to PyPI (even the test server), you cannot fix\nsomething and re-upload it.  You must increment the version number somehow in\norder to upload an updated file.  While doing your first tests of your\npackaging, it's a good idea to use a ``.devN`` suffix while you work on getting\nit right: ``__version__ = \"0.1.0.dev0\"``.\n\nCheck over your page.  Make sure everything looks the way you want, including\nthe metadata in the left-hand sidebar, and the formatting of the README.  If\nyou need to fix something, increment the ``.devN`` suffix of your version\nnumber, re-make the distributions, and upload them again.\n\nUpload for real\n---------------\n\nOnce your package looks right on the test PyPI server, you can upload your\npackage for real!\n\nFix the version number to get rid of the ``.devN`` suffix, then make new\ndistributions, and upload them to PyPI::\n\n    rm -fr build/ dist/ src/*.egg-info\n    python -m build --sdist --wheel\n    python -m twine check dist/*\n    python -m twine upload --verbose dist/*\n    # or: make clean dist pypi\n\nYour package is available\n-------------------------\n\nNow anyone can install your package by using pip::\n\n    pip install pkgsample\n\nYou did it!\n\n.. _changelog: https://keepachangelog.com/\n.. _pypi: https://pypi.org\n.. _virtualenv: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment\n",
