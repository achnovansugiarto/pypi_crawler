It is like a goto Tool specially meant for Recruiters and Talent Acquitions so that they can handle Large number of Applicants in an organised way. \n\n\n![Machine Learning Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/1507038841.jpg)\n\n\n## How much Coding do you require in order to run PyRecruiter?\n\nThis Package specially focuses on **Recruiter's ease** that is why it has very **few lines of code** in order to run our default model **(Actually around 3-4 lines to be honest)**. If you are familiar with Python and it's Libraries, you can definitely use it to make more accurate or add your own optimised models but the **Default model has been well optimized** and is more than enough for people with **no background knowledge in Machine learning or Data science**. \n\n## How it Works?\n\nIt is a Two Step Process where the Recruiter can take Candidate Information through Microsoft Forms Template for which the link would be given in below in the Readme File. \nCandidates would fill the form and the response would be directed to the Recruiter's response excel sheet.\n\n## Let's Understand how Recruiters can Play around with the Microsoft Template and what are the Guidelines?\n\n#### Link to the Shareable Template : [Microsoft Forms Template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAP0NdvxUODk5SzIzUDNCWEJKMUlEVU5QVlcxR1g3SS4u&sharetoken=w2KLYBfeSbYsfPMujHCd)\n\nRecruiters are requested to Understand what how would this Form do and upto what limit they can change the Form according to the Job Description.**Note: Recruiters are requested to Duplicate the Same Template and Recruiters can change the Question content based on the JD but the whole Meaning and the Options should not Change**\n\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/newrrrr.PNG\" width = 500>\n<br />\n\n\n### Let's Take an Example and compare a Random Job Description and see how a Recruiter can use the Information from JD to the Form\n<br />\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/eee.PNG\" width = 500>\n<br />\n\n<br />This Package also gives Recruiters an additional option to know if the Candidate is looking for a **Domain change towards ML/AI.** \n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/3.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />Here Experience part here is given as 5-7 years in the JD but PyRecruiter gives Recruiters to set Experience info from Candidate as category of **3 Types which can be Low , Medium and High.** Recruiters can Change the Experience Distribution in the Question but the important thing is to **keep the importance from Low to High form.**<br />\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/2.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />This Package gives Recruiters **3 Options for adding Programming Languages**. For this example it can be Python, R and SLQ. This information can be changed but the Options should not be changed<br />\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/4.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />It also have options for adding **4 Required Skills/Libraries/Frameworks** from the JD. In this example it can be Redshift , Digital Ocean , S3 and Spark.\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/5.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />If there are **Required Skills** then Candidates should have **Applied Projects with regards to the same skills**. This Package accepts 4 types which should be the **Number of Projects the Candidates has with respect to the Number of Skills.**\n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/7.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />This Package also gives an important additional skill which is the Number of **Story-Telling Projects a Candidate has, which are 3 at Max (Currenty).** In this example it can be Experience with **Tableau or visualization libraries.**\n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/6.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />This Package also gives another important additional skill which is the Number of **Domain Centric Projects a Candidate has, which are 3 at Max (Currenty).** In this example it can be Experience with **Banking sector**.\n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/8.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />This Package also gives asks for the **Candidate's Education Qualification** which are **Bachelors , Masters and PHD.** **NOTE:** This info can be changed but the **Order of Importance and the Options should be Same** like 3 would be the Highest one and followed by 2 and 1.\n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/9.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n<br />This Package gives **slight Weightage to Good Certifications** like the **Test Based Certificates and Less Importance to Course Based and No Certificates.**\n\n<br /><img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/10.PNG\" width = 500>\n\n## How can a Recruiter use PyRecruiter?\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/1525195037.jpg\" width = 500>\n\n### Codes\n\n#### Recruiters can take that Response excel sheet and go to their Command line and do following Codes:-\n\n```python\n\npip install pyrecruiter as pr\n\n```\n\n<br />Here the Recruiter can **Install the PyRecruiter package from PyPi**\n\n```python\n\n\nmodel = pr.Model()\n\n```\n\n<br />This command would **initiate the Model class** that is in the .py file.\n\n```python\n\nmodel.train_model()\n\n```\n\n<br />Here the user gets an option by including **dataset parameter** which gives Recruiters an option to include either the `dataset = 'orig_data` **(Default)** or `dataset = experience Data` which is biased towards high **Experience**.\n\n\n```python\n\nmodel.load_test_data(data_path='New Microsoft Excel Worksheet.xlsx')\n\n```\n\n<br />Here Recruiters can provide the path to the Response excel sheet which they get through Microsoft forms \n\n```python\n\nmodel.evaluate()\n\n```\n<br />Now they can see the **Results** in the command line as well as they get an **Excel Sheet containing the Names and Email IDs of all Candidates with their Probability of Getting shortlisted as well as the Predicted Result.**\n\n## How can a Job Seeker or a Contributer who is familiar with Python can use PyRecruiter?\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/ddddd.PNG\" width = 200><br />\n\n```python\n\npip install pyrecruiter as pr\n\n```\n\nHere the User can **Install the PyRecruiter package from PyPi**\n\n\n```python\n\n\nModel_data = pr.Model()\n\n```\n\nThis command would **initiate the Model class** that is in the .py file.\n\n\n```python\n\n\nModel_data = pr.Model(dataset='experience_data')\n\n```\n\n\nHere the Users gets an option by including **dataset parameter** which gives Recruiters an option to include either the `dataset = 'orig_data` **(Default)** or `dataset = experience Data` which is biased towards high **Experience**.\n\nNow the Contributers can **create their own model** with the data they want to train on and can **imporove the Accuracy or include new features through Feature Engineering.**\n\n\n```python\n\nmodel.load_test_data(data_path='New Microsoft Excel Worksheet.xlsx')\n\n```\n\nHere Users can provide the path to the Response excel sheet which they get through Microsoft forms \n\n\n```python\n\nmodel.evaluate()\n\n```\n\nNow they can see the **Results** in the command line as well as they get an **Excel Sheet containing the Names and Email IDs of all Candidates with their Probability of Getting shortlisted as well as the Predicted Result.**\n\n\n### Results\n\n\n\n\n<img src= \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp04/PyRecruiter/main/Images/12.PNG\" width = 500><br />\n\n\n\n\n\n> This Package focuses on **Minimum code** and the **Right Parameters** for Shortlisting Candidates apart from the Traditional Parameters like __Education Qualification__ and **Work Experience**. \n\n\n\nChange Log\n==========\n\n0.0.1 (14/11/2020)\n-------------------\n- First
