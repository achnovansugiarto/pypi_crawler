    "description": "# Ultrametric matrix tools <!-- omit in toc -->\nThis toolbox provides functions and data structures to construct and handle ultrametric matrices in Rust and Python. The aim of the project is to provide efficient tools for ultrametric matrices and ultrametric trees. Currently, the project has the following features.\n\n### Features: <!-- omit in toc -->\n- Generate a random ultrametric matrix\n- Test ultramtic matrix property\n- Construct the ultrametric tree from the ultrametric matrix\n- Get properties of ultrametric tree\n- Fast multiplication of ultrametric matrix with vector\n\nThe implementation is written in Rust and can be cross-compiled to Python.\n\n## Table of Contents <!-- omit in toc -->\n- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n  - [Quickstart Rust](#quickstart-rust)\n  - [Quickstart Python](#quickstart-python)\n- [Build](#build)\n  - [Build Rust Library](#build-rust-library)\n  - [Build Python Module](#build-python-module)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n  - [Rust Example](#rust-example)\n  - [Python Example](#python-example)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)\n\n## Quickstart\n### Quickstart Rust\nAdd the following to the ```Cargo.toml``` file:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\n# TODO: replace the * by the latest version.\nultrametric_matrix_tools = \"*\"\n```\nAn example of the usage of is:\n```rust\nuse ultrametric_matrix_tools::na::{DMatrix, DVector};\nuse ultrametric_matrix_tools::UltrametricTree;\n\nfn main() {\n    let matrix = DMatrix::from_vec(\n        4,\n        4,\n        vec![\n            0.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 5.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0,\n        ],\n    );\n    let vector = DVector::from_vec(vec![4.0, 2.0, 7.0, 5.0]);\n\n    let tree = UltrametricTree::from_matrix(&matrix);\n    let product = tree * vector;\n}\n```\n\n[More examples](#rust-example) can be found in `./examples/`.\n\n### Quickstart Python\nYou can install the current release by running:\n```console\npip install ultrametric_matrix_tools\n```\n\nAn example of the construction of the ultrametric tree and multiplication with it is:\n```python\nfrom ultrametric_matrix_tools import UltrametricTree\nimport numpy as np\n\nmatrix = np.array([[0.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0], [1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0], [\n                  3.0, 1.0, 5.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]])\nvector = np.array([4.0, 2.0, 7.0, 5.0])\n\ntree = UltrametricTree(matrix)\nproduct = tree.mult(vector)\n```\n\n[More examples](#python-example) can be found in `./examples/`.\n\n## Build\n### Build Rust Library\nThe Rust library is build by running:\n```console\ncargo build --release\n```\nThe compiled Rust library is located in `./target/release/` and can be copied from there.\n\n### Build Python Module\nThe Python module is build from the Rust code using the [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3). To build the Python module, you need to [install Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run:\n```console\ncargo build --release\n```\nThe compiled Python module is located in `./target/release/` and can be copied from there.\n\nTo export the Python wheels from a Linux host system run the following commands:\n\nLinux (requires docker):\n```console\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io konstin2/maturin build --release\n```\n\nWindows (requires mingw32-python and mingw64-python):\n```console\nmake python_package_windows\n```\n\nCurrently, cross-compiling to macOS is not supported.\n\n## Examples\n### Rust Example\nYou can try out the Rust examples, you need to [install Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). You can try out the Python examples located in `./examples/` by running the following command:\n```console\ncargo run --release --example [example_name]\n```\nE.g. to run the multiplication example run:\n```console\ncargo run --release --example multiplication\n```\n\n### Python Example\nTo run the Python examples, you need to [install Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). You can try out the Python examples located in `./examples/` by running the following command:\n```console\nmake python_example name=[example_name]\n```\nE.g. to run the multiplication example run:\n```console\nmake python_example name=multiplication\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have the Python package already installed via pip, then you can run the examples directly:\n```console\npython [example_name].py\n```\n\n## License\nThis project is under the [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE).\n\n## Benchmarks\nThe benchmarks use `criterion` for `cargo`, which can be installed by running:\n```console\ncargo install cargo-criterion\n```\n\nThe benchmarks can be found in `./benches` and are run by:\n```console\ncargo criterion --bench [benchmark_name]\n```\n",
