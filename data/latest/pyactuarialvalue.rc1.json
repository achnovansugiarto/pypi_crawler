    "description": "pyActuarialValue\n================\n\npyActuarialValue is an open source implementation of the `Actuarial\nValue\ncalculator <http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/2015-av-calculator-final.xlsm>`__\ndeveloped the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for\ndetermining the relative amount of claims paid a health plan.\n\npyActuarialValue is in early stages of development. Many plan types are\nnot supported but the goal is to support the complete calculator and\noffer additional support for alternate actuarial value statements.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nBefore running the calculator run ``seed_data`` to load the actuarial\nvalue(AV) data.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe core actuarial value function takes a representation of the health\nplan. This representation can be created using directly from or through\na JSON representation. Details of the JSON representation can be found\nin the wiki for this repo.\n\nIt is also possible to run the calculator directly from the command\nline. To run the calculator from the command line simply type\n``av {health_plan_json}``.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe calculator is built in an incremental fashion to be used as quickly\nas possible. If you would like a specific set of benefits to be included\nin the calculator or have found an error in the calculator please open\nan issue.\n\nIf you are planning on implementing a set of benefits in the calculator,\nplease open an issue as well so that other developers know that those\nsets of benefits will be implemented.\n\nPlease rebase and squash all commits into a single commit before\nsubmitting a pull request.",
