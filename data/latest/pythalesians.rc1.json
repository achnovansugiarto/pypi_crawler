    "description": "PyThalesians is an open source Python financial library developed by the Thalesians (http://www.thalesians.com). Provides a unified wrapper for downloading from multiple market data sources including Bloomberg (via Bloomberg API) and Yahoo. Also produces elegant charts wrapping on top of Matplotlib, Plotly and Bokeh (limited support) via Chartesians module.\r\n\r\nThe proprietary part of the library includes more detailed analysis modules and also the Thalesians own trading algorithms.\r\n\r\nIt is currently a highly experimental library in an alpha phase. You can download source code at http://www.github.com/thalesians/pythalesians - for future versions we shall simplify the setup.",
