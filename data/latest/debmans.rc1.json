    "description": "Documentation extractor and renderer for Debian packages\n========================================================\n\n``debmans`` is a tool to extract documentation (currently manpages) from\nDebian packages and transform them into HTML for viewing with a normal\nweb browser.\n\nThis suite of tools is designed to run on `manpages.debian.org\n<https://manpages.debian.org/>`_, `manpages.ubuntu.com\n<http://manpages.ubuntu.com/>`_, `linux.die.net\n<https://linux.die.net/man/>`_ or similar services.\n\n.. split\n\nExample\n-------\n\nYou can do a test run of this software against your local APT cache,\nlike this::\n\n    $ ( cd /var/cache/apt/archives/ && dpkg-scanpackages . | sudo tee Packages > /dev/null )\n    dpkg-scanpackages: warning: package tar (filename ./tar_1.27.1-2+b1_amd64.deb) is repeat;\n    dpkg-scanpackages: warning: ignored that one and using data from ./tar_1.27.1-2+deb8u1_amd64.deb!\n    $ debmans -m /var/cache/apt/archives -o html -v --progress extract render site serve\n    extracting files matching patterns: (u'man/(?:\\\\w+/)?man[1-9]/.+\\\\.[1-9]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.gz)?$',) in mirror /var/cache/apt/archives\n    extracting packages  [####################################]  100%\n    completed inspection of 564 packages, extracted 559 files\n    received 559 paths from extractor\n    rendering manpages  [#################################---]   92%  0d 00:00:02man2html: unable to open or read file man1/dmenu.1\n    rendering manpages  [####################################]  100%\n    looking for static files to render in *.mdwn\n    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000...\n\nYour rendered manpages will be available at <http://localhost:8000/>.\n\nNote that you will need ``dpkg-scanpackages`` from the\n`dpkg-dev <https://tracker.debian.org/dpkg-dev>`__ package to run the\nabove test. The warnings can be safely ignored. ``debmans`` doesn't\nnormally require ``dpkg-dev`` in operation if you use a properly\nconfigured mirror.\n\nCommon tasks\n------------\n\nA more normal run would be to run on a regular mirror. This will extract\nall manpages from the given mirror and convert to HTML::\n\n    debmans --mirror /srv/mirror --output static extract render\n\nThis can be ran repeatedly and only extracted manpages will be rendered.\n\nExtraction only\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can also run the process step by step, for example, this will only\nextract the manpages::\n\n    debmans -m /srv/mirror -o html extract\n\nNote that extract creates a cache in the output directory to avoid\nre-extracting already found archives. Render also uses a caching\nmechanism by not converting to HTML if the HTML version is newer than\nthe manpage. Those mechanisms can be disabled with ``--no-cache``.\n\n::\n\n    debmans -m /srv/mirror -o html --no-cache extract\n\nYou can make a trial run with the ``-n`` flag and enable more verbose\nlogging::\n\n    debmans -v -n -m /srv/mirror -o manpages extract\n\nRendering only\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRendering the pages can be done separately with::\n\n    debmans -o html render --srcdir manpages\n\nThis is especially important if the extraction process was interrupted,\nas only part of the manpages will be rendered on subsequent runs.\n\nManpages are currently rendered with\n`man2html <http://users.actrix.gen.nz/michael/vhman2html.html>`__ but\nthis can be changed with the ``-r`` flag, although no other renderer has\nbeen tested and the output may not be compatible with ``man2html``.\n\nStatic pages rendering\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe templating engine is fairly simple, based on Jinja2, which uses\nstandard ``{{foo}}`` placeholders. The template is in\n``static/template.html`` and should be following debian.org's graphic\ndesign conventions.\n\nThis should generate the markdown files::\n\n    debmans -o html site\n\nUse ``--prefix`` if the directory is not at the root of the host.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``debmans`` can be installed through pip with::\n\n    pip install debmans\n\nSource code can also be found on `Gitlab\n<https://gitlab.com/anarcat/debmans>`_ with Git or as a tarball, or\non Debian's `collab-maint repository\n<git://anonscm.debian.org/collab-maint/debmans.git>`_.\n\nThe source code is should be installed with::\n\n    ./setup.py install\n\nIt can also be ran from the source tree directly with::\n\n    python -m debmans render\n\nThe dependencies are listed in the ``setup.py`` file.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n``debmans`` was written by Antoine Beaupré and is licensed under the\nAffero GPLv3, see ``license`` for the complete license.\n\nParts of this software were inspired by a review of existing tools, most\nnotably the `Ubuntu manpages\nconverter <https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manpage-repository>`__ and\n`dgilman's converter <https://github.com/dgilman/manpages>`__. The\n`sources.debian.net <http://sources.debian.net/>`__ service source code\nand design was also directly used in some parts, which is partly why\n``debmans`` is licensed under the AGPL.\n\nAlso thanks to Paul Wise for nudging me along and all the help\nnavigating the various tools and protocols to make all this work.\n\nThis project mostly follows the `Core\nInfrastructure <https://coreinfrastructure.org/>`__ `best\npractices <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/>`__, see the\n`full\nreport <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/489>`__\nfor details.",
