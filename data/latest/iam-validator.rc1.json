    "description": "# IAM Validator for Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)\n\nThe module will test IAM policies to ensure they are successful, and also test that a 'negative test' fails.\n\nWe do both a 'positive test' and a 'negative test' to ensure the policy acts as expected, and allows and denies in \naccordance with the policy.\n\nWhy someone needs this tool:\n----------------------------\nI you have ever deployed IAM policy changes to an organization, you will know you have the potential to break\nmany users, roles and resources if an incorrect policy is applied.\n\nYou will do your best to have peer reviews, and check the policies with the IAM validator, but you still have errors\nin your policies because the IAM policy simulator does not validate context and conditions correctly.\n\nWith this tool, you can ensure 100% percent accuracy of your IAM policies, because you are testing against actual\nAWS resources.\n\nYes, I say 100% accuracy, because you are testing, actual policies against actual resources.  In addition, your\nnot just testing to determine if the policy works, but you are also testing to ensure the policy does not work\nfor someone who does not have the correct attributes.\n\nThis will give you, and auditors, 100% assurance that users can not get outside their lanes, and perform actions\nthey do not have permissions to perform.\n\nThe concept is:\n---------------\n- Setup creates:\n   - Positive testing role\n   - Negative testing role (with different attributes)\n   - Developer testing role (for developing and testing conditionals)\n      - Has access to S3 Terraform statefile bucket\n      - Attach policy you would like to test to this role\n      \n- Validation\n  - Attaches the policies and permissions boundary to the positive and negative testing role, but with different tag\n    attributes for the negative testing role - which should cause the tests to fail.\n\n- Destory:\n  - Destroys all AWS resources created during setup.\n      \n## How it works\n\n- The policies attached to the developer testing role are attached to the positive and negative testing role.\n- Permissions boundary from developer testing role is put on positive and negative testing role.\n- Tags are copies from developer testing role to positive and negative testing roles, except the attribute is changed for the negative testing role.\n- The user/role assumes the positive testing role and:\n   - Passes a comma delimited list of AWS resources associated with the ABAC conditions to terraform module\n   - A terraform init and terraform apply are executed to create the resources.\n   - A terraform destory is executed to demonstrate positive testing role can destroy resources.\n\n- The user/role assumes the negative testing role and:\n   - Passes a comma delimited list of AWS resources associated with the ABAC conditions to terraform module\n   - A terraform init and terraform apply are executed to create the resources and demonstrate negative testing role is denied creation.\n   - A terraform destory is executed to demonstrate testing role can destroy resources.\n  \n- All policies and tags are detached and remove from positive and negative testing role\n\n## Where is the data and config files stored\n\nA directory named ~/.iamv is created, and contains a file named config - which contains all the configuration\ninformation.\n\nThere is also a directory called 'data', which contains all the terraform and module directories.  All terraform\ncommands are run against this directory.\n\n\n## How to run demo\n\nThis will:\n1. Create an S3 bucket and Dynamodb table for terraform state files and locking\n2. Create two roles for testing, and one role to test.\n3. Example policies and permissions boundary to attach to the role we are testing.\n4. Will attached the policies from the role we are testing to the positive and negative testing role.\n5. Deploy terraform for the resource we are testing ( example: iam_role)\n6. Output the results of the test\n7. Destroy the policies, roles, s3 bucket and dynamodb table.\n\n```bash\n iam-validator demo -r iam_role\n```\n\n## Setup testing roles\n\nThis will setup the s3 bucket, dynamodb table, and testing roles and policies.\n\n```bash\niam-validator setup\n```\n\n## Validate an AWS resource\n\nThis will create an AWS resource to test the positive role passes, and the negative role fails.\n\n```bash\niam-validator validate -r iam_role\n```\n\n## Destroy all AWS resources\n\nThis will destory the s3 bucket, dynamodb table, iam testing roles, and iam testing policies.\n\n```bash\niam-validator destroy\n```\n\n## Reading the Output\n\nWhen we run validate for resource asg, ec2, eni, security group, ebs volume, and iam_role, we are testing to determine if the positive\ntesting role can execute these functions, and a negative testing role with different attributes\ncan not execute these functions.\n\nIn this example, the positive role had no errors applying and destroying the resources, but the\nnegative testing role could not create an eni or role.  Thus, the policy is valid.\n\n```bash\niam-validator validate -r eni,iam_role,sg,ebs,ec2,asg\n\n{\n    \"positive_role\": {\n        \"apply_errors\": [],\n        \"destroy_errors\": []\n    },\n    \"negative_role\": {\n        \"apply_errors\": [\n            \"Error: error creating EC2 Network Interface: UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform this operation.
