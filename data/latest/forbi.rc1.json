    "description": "=====\nforbi\n=====\n\nforbi is a TCP-based communication tool with PKCS#1 OAEP RSA\nencryption. It consists of a server and a client. The server keeps\ntrack of online users and forwards messages from clients to other\nclients. It is easy to configure what the forbi client should do when\nit receives a message. Its default action is to show it in a small\nwindow.\n\nforbi is designed to be both a secure message sender and a \"pre-chat\"\nmessage mechanism. If you want one of your friends to join an IRC\nchannel, for example, you simply send him a message::\n\n  $ forbi-send 'Mr. Spock' 'Come to #thechannel now!'\n\n(Note that this will only work if both you and your friend have forbi\nclients running.)\n\nBecause your friend has his forbi client configured in a way that\nworks best for him (perhaps he has configured his client to run a\nprogram that makes a lot of noise when he receives a message, or maybe\nsomething else), he is sure to notice your message.\n  \n\nLicense\n=======\n\nforbi is free software under the terms of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License version 3 (or any later version). This is version 0.1.0\nof the program.\n\nThe libraries used by forbi are AGPL-compatible.\n\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nWay #1\n------\n\nJust run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::\n\n  # easy_install forbi\n\n\nWay #2\n------\n\nGet the newest version of forbi at http://metanohi.org/projects/forbi/\nor at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/forbi\n\nExtract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::\n\n  # python setup.py install\n\n  \nDependencies\n============\n\nPython 2.6 is required. Python 3.x cannot be used because at least one\nof the required modules requires Python 2.x.\n\n``m2crypto``\n + Web address: http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto\n + License: Modified BSD license\n + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-m2crypto`` (or something similar)\n\n``dbus``\n + Web address: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings\n + License: Expat license\n + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-dbus`` (or something similar)\n\n``gobject``\n + Web address: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings\n + License: LGPL 2.1+\n + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-gobject`` (or something similar)\n\n``tk``\n + Web address: \n + License: Python Software Foundation License\n + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-tk`` (or something similar)\n\n\nOptional extras\n---------------\n\nIf present, forbi will also use these Python modules:\n\n``termcolor``\n + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/\n + License: GPLv3+\n + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install termcolor``\n\nNote that ``termcolor`` is included with forbi, so you don't\nreally have to install it.\n \n``setproctitle``\n + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/\n + License: New BSD License\n + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle``\n\n\nUsing\n=====\n\nTo see a list of forbi's command-line options, run ``forbi --help``.\n\n\nAs a client\n-----------\n\nThe forbi client can only be used together with a forbi server. If you\ndon't know of anyone with a forbi server, you can run the server on\nthe same computer as your client. In this case, the host address you\nmust give the forbi client is ``localhost``.\n\nThe client will run just fine with no command-line arguments. To start\nit, just run ``forbi``. When it is up and running, you can send\ncommands to it with ``forbi-send``. To see what commands exist and\nwhat arguments they require, run ``forbi-send --help``.\n\nSee the ``examples/`` directory for simple message receival scripts.\n\n\nAs a server\n-----------\n\nIt is equally easy to run forbi as a server. The simplest way is to\nrun ``forbi -s``. Be aware that while data transportation in forbi\nis secure, protection against overflooding is non-existent. Anyone can\nregister as a user on a forbi server, and there are no limits (except\nfor those imposed by the underlying system) on how many clients can be\nconnected to the server at the same time.\n\n\nIn general\n----------\n\nforbi works by sending commands back and forth between server and\nclients. These commands are not at all frozen and could very well\nchange in any eventual new releases. There are no detailed\ndescriptions of how the responses to commands should be, but it works\nfor now.\n\nforbi supports adjusting settings using a config file. To see an\nexample of such a config file, take a look at ``forbi.conf`` in the\n``examples/`` directory of this distribution.\n\nThe homepage for forbi is at http://metanohi.org/projects/forbi/\n\n\nDeveloping\n==========\n\nforbi is written in Python and uses Git for branches. To get the\nlatest branch, get it from gitorious.org like this::\n\n  $ git clone git://gitorious.org/forbi/forbi.git\n\nBugs can be reported at ns@metanohi.org (address of sole developer)\n\n\nThis document\n=============\n\nCopyright (C) 2010  Niels Serup\n\nCopying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\nare permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\nnotice and this notice are preserved.
