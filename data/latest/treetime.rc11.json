In _Tree 2_ it is a child of _D_.\n\nIn _TreeTime_, a _node_ or _item_ can hold different information like text, numbers, dates, internet links.\nThese are saved in the _item's_ _fields_.\n\nHere we have a field we call \"value\". Each node in all trees has a value field that can hold a number (like a cell in a spread sheet).\nThe node A has the value=1, B=2, etc.\nIn addition we have a field we call \"Sum\".\nIts content is calculated automatically, summing up the item's own value plus the values of all children.\nIn _TreeTime_, looking at item _E_ and _Tree 1_ this looks like this:  \n![Tree 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/abcde01.png)  \nClicking on the other tab shows the second tree while the same items stays selected:  \n![Tree 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/abcde02.png)  \nNote how the values are summed up the branches.\nApart from sums, _TreeTime_ also offers means, ratios, or differences, using different combinations of parent, child, or sibling fields.  \n  \nLinked trees are a natural and powerful way to structure data.\nIf you, for instance, organise information about animals, you might want to see the animal's taxonomy (kingdom/class/family/species), but also their habitat (continent/country/area), and switch between both views.\nIf you organise tasks, you could switch between a year/quarter/week/day breakdown, a company/department/team/person tree, and a product/project/package/task overview.  \n  \nIn _TreeTime_, the structure of your data (whether you store priority, hours, and a description for a task, or expected life span, habitat and number of legs for an animal), the trees themselves, and the calculated values within the trees are completely user defined. Data is stored in text files, changes are saved on the fly, and when opening _TreeTime_, the software is automatically connected to the last used file.  \n  \n<div id='id-usage'/>\n\n##  Basic Use  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-contents)\n\nStart the software (see 'Execute' from the section [Installation](#id-installation)). In the main dialog, go to \"File\" / \"New from Template\", select \"Simple-Task-List.trt\" and in the next dialog give a file name for the new file. An example file with a simple project task list structure will open.  \n  \nThe GUI consists of three parts:  \n- A button box on the left. Execute tree structure operations from here.\n- An editing grid in the middle, showing the contents of the selected data item. Edit single data items here.\n- A tab view with tress spanning the center-right. View and analyse your data here.\n  \n![Screenshot 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/screenshot01.png)  \nAccess each single tree by clicking a tab on the main tree-view widget (the picture above shows the tree _Time Plan_, the picture below the tree _Projects_).  \n![Screenshot 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/screenshot02.png)  \nBranches and children can be sorted, branches can be folded and unfolded. Data content is shown via analytic fields that are defined per tree. In the example project you will see a sum, a percentage, and text display.  \n  \nAdd, move and remove single nodes and complete branches by using the buttons on the left. Change the name of a node by selecting the node and editing the name in the top of the edit grid in the middle. Change all other values (numbers or text) by clicking into the field and start typing.  \n  \nThe parents of an item are listed underneath the item name. Each tree has a separate line. Change the position of a node within a tree by clicking on any of the parent buttons.  \n![Screenshot 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/screenshot03.png)  \nIn this example a new node in the tree _Time Plan_ has just been created, and is now added to the tree _Projects_.  \n  \n_TreeTime_ lets you select different themes and will try to use the default colours that are defined with your operating system.  \n  \n![Screenshot 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkanev/treetime/master/docs/screenshot04.png)  \n\n<dif id='id-file-syntax'/>\n\n## Data Files ##\n\n_TreeTime_'s data is stored in ._trt_ files. These are plain editable text files. Please have a look at the file _Simple-Task-List.trt_ to understand the syntax. A detailed description will follow later. (Sorry...)\n\n<div id='id-installation'/>\n\n##  Installation  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-installation)\n\n### Using pre-compiled Binaries ###\n\n- Windows, Linux: Go to [github.com/jkanev/treetime/releases/tag/2023.1](https://github.com/jkanev/treetime/releases/tag/2023.1) and download a zipped package for Windows 10, 64 bit, or for Linux 64 bit from there. Unzip it into your program directory and run _TreeTime_ or _TreeTime.exe_ from the new folder. Unzip the data package too. Add the program folder to your path.  \n  \n  Executable bundles have been created with pyinstaller ([www.pyinstaller.org](http://www.pyinstaller.org)).\n\n- Mac: Mac users please use the Python code (see below). There is no executable for Mac.\n(If anybody can help building an executable for other platforms I'd be delighted.)\n\n### Using a PyPi package in Python ###\n\n1. If you don't have it yet, install python3\n2. Install PyQt5 -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type:  \n    `pip install pyqt5`\n3. Install _TreeTime_ -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type:\n    `pip install treetime`\n\n### Using script code with Python ###\n\n1. If you don't have it yet, install python3\n2. Install PyQt5 -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type: `pip install pyqt5`\n3. Download this project from GitHub as a zip file (https://github.com/jkanev/treetime/archive/master.zip) and unzip\n4. Install _TreeTime_: in the command line, cd into the main directory, then type:\n   - Linux:  \n       `python3 setup.py build`  \n       `python3 setup.py install --user`  \n   - Windows:  \n       `py setup.py build`  \n       `py setup.py install`  \n\n### Execute ###\n\n- Windows: Hit the Windows key and type \"TreeTime\", then click the \"run command treetime\" that comes up.\n- Linux, Mac: On the command line, type \"TreeTime\". You can also start this any other way your operating system supports. Plus, there's a .desktop file (for KDE and Gnome) in the data directory to create desktop or menu link.\n\n\n<div id='id-roadmap'/>\n\n##  Road-Map  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-contents)\n\nI deliberately didn't give any time estimates for this. I'm using the software myself to organise my own data, so I'm interested in keeping this going. Nevertheless I cannot promise any specific release dates.
