It is based on the\nmodule sale_delivery_state, which adds the field at sale order level.\n\nDelivery state is computed based on `qty_delivered` field on sale order line.\n\nThe state of the sale order line can be forced to fully delivered in case\nsome quantities were cancelled by the customer and you consider you have\nnothing more to deliver.\n\nSale order lines can have products or services, as long as the field `qty_delivered`\nis set, it will trigger the computation of delivery state.\n\nThis module also works with delivery.carrier fees that are added as a\nsale order line. Thoses line are special as they will never be considered delivered.\nDelivery fees lines are ignored in the computation of the delivery state.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20sale_order_line_delivery_state%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* ForgeFlow\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Jordi Masvidal <jordi.masvidal@forgeflow.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/sale-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/tree/15.0/sale_order_line_delivery_state>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
