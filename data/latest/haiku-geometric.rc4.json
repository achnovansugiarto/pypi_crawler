Haiku Geometric tries to provide **object-oriented** and **easy-to-use** modules for GNNs.\n\nHaiku Geometric is built on top of [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) and [Jraph](https://github.com/deepmind/jraph).\nHaiku Geometric is deeply inspired by [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric). \nIn most cases, Haiku Geometric tries to replicate the API of PyTorch Geometric to allow code sharing between the two.\n\nHaiku Geometric is still under development and I would advise against using it in production.\n\n## Installation\n\nHaiku Geometric can be installed using pip:\n```bash\npip install haiku-geometric\n```\nAlternatively, you can install Haiku Geometric from source:\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/alexOarga/haiku-geometric.git\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nFor instance, we can create a simple graph convolutional network (GCN) of 2 layers \nas follows:\n```python\nimport jax\nimport haiku as hk\nfrom haiku_geometric.nn import GCNConv\n\nclass GCN(hk.Module):\n    super().__init__()\n    def __init__(self, hidden_channels, out_channels):\n        self.conv1 = GCNConv(hidden_channels)\n        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels)\n        self.linear = hk.Linear(out_channels)\n\n    def __call__(self, nodes,senders, receivers):\n        x = self.conv1(nodes, senders, receivers)\n        x = jax.nn.relu(x)\n        x = self.conv2(x, senders, receivers)\n        x = self.linear(nodes)\n        return x\n\ndef forward(nodes, senders, receivers):\n    gcn = GCN(16, 7)\n    return gcn(nodes, senders, receivers)\n```\n\nThe GNN that we have defined is a Haiku Module. \nTo convert our module in a function that can be used with JAX, we transform\nit using `hk.transform` as described in the \n[Haiku documentation](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n```python\nmodel = hk.transform(forward)\nmodel = hk.without_apply_rng(model)\nrng = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)\nparams = model.init(rng, nodes=nodes, senders=senders, receivers=receivers)\n```\n\nWe can now run a forward pass on the model:\n```python\noutput = model.apply(params=params, nodes=nodes, senders=senders, receivers=receivers)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for Haiku Geometric can be found [here](https://haiku-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Examples\n\nHaiku Geometric comes with a few examples that showcase the usage of the library.\nThe following examples are available:\n\n|                                                     | Link        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Graph Convolution Networks with Karate
