If we have a tree of locations and sublocations, this module will update the associated warehouse every time we modify a location parent.\nIf a location changes its father location, it will change its associated warehouse and all its childs too.\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo use the module, our  instance must be configured first:\nWe have to go to configuration > settings and check the box in the warehouse section called \"storage locations\".\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe usage of this module is automatic but here's an explanation to force its behavior.\nGo to Configuration>Locations and select a location that at least has one child. Edit the location's \"Parent Location\" to a different one and save the changes. Once the changes are saved, \"Associated Warehouse\" will be updated with a new warehouse. After this, go to any of its children and check the info: if things go well, \"Associated Warehouse\" will have changed too.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_location_warehouse%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* ForgeFlow\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `ForgeFlow <https://forgeflow.com>`_:\n\n    * Joan Mateu <joan.mateu@forgeflow.com>\n\n    * Bernat Puig <bernat.puig@forgeflow.com>\n\n    * √Ålvaro Trius <alvaro.trius@forgeflow.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/14.0/stock_location_warehouse>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
