    "description": "Plone Scholarly Journal\n***********************\n\nThe ``Plone Scholarly Journal`` (PSJ) is a collection of packages to\ncreate and maintain scholarly journals using Plone.\n\nThe special abilities of PSJ are:\n\n * High quality on-the-fly transformations of office documents using\n   OpenOffice.org.\n\n * Flexible metadata handling\n\nThis package is an umbrella package that brings all other psj-related\npackages together.\n\nCurrently, the whole thing consists of three packages:\n\n * ``psj.content`` (content types with extended metadata handling)\n\n * ``psj.policy`` (provides mainly office-document transformations using\n   OpenOffice.org)\n\n * ``psj.site`` (this package).\n\n\nThis package creates a vanilla psj-site with the required scripts to\nstart, stop and maintain the site.\n\n`psj` relies on the content management framework Plone. Visit\n\n   http://www.plone.org/\n\nto learn more about Plone.\n\nPlone itself is backed up by Zope, an open source application\nframework of upper-level quality and reliability. See\n\n   http://www.zope.org/\n\nto learn more about Zope.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n*************\n\nYou need the following things to install this package:\n\n- **Python 2.4**\n\n  Currently Python 2.4 is needed to run Zope (Plone and psj). You can\n  find out, whether you have Python 2.4 installed by opening a shell\n  and entering::\n\n    $ python -V\n\n  This should give you something like::\n\n    Python 2.4.3\n\n  Note, that the whole thing won't work with Python <= 2.3 nor with\n  newer versions (>= 2.5).\n\n\n- **`easy_install` and Python `setuptools`**\n\n  If you don't have `easy_install` already available, you can find the\n  script to set it up on the `PEAK EasyInstall page` at:\n\n    http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install\n\n  You need to download `ez_setup.py`, which is available at:\n\n    http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py\n\n  Then, you run it like this to install ``easy_install`` into your\n  system Python::\n\n    $ sudo python2.4 ez_setup.py\n\n  This will make ``easy_install-2.4`` available to you.\n\n  Then you can install the Python ``setuptools`` simply by entering::\n\n    $ sudo easy_install-2.4 setuptools\n\n\n- **A C-compiler**\n\n  This is needed for compilation of the Zope 2 core elements. On Linux\n  systems you normally have the Gnu C compiler `gcc` available.\n\n\n- **PIL**\n\n  The Python Imaging Library must be installed in your Python\n  path. You can check, whether this is true by opening a shell and\n  entering::\n\n     $ python2.4 -c \"import PIL\"\n\n  If you get no output at all, everything is fine. If you get a\n  complaint like this::\n\n     Traceback (most recent call last):\n       File \"<string>\", line 1, in ?\n     ImportError: No module named PIL\n\n  then you have to install PIL before you proceed. PIL is available\n  from\n\n     http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\n\n  Please follow the instructions given in the package.\n\nYou do *not* need to have a version of Plone or Zope already\ninstalled. Instead, the build process will grab, configure and install\nall other packages needed from the web.\n\n  \nInstallation\n************\n\nFirst, make sure your system meets the requirements mentioned above.\n\n`psj` uses a `zc.buildout`-driven installation process, that has to be\ninitialized first. Because ``buildout`` needs a fairly recent version\nof ``setuptools``, you should update your version of it::\n\n    $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools\n\nThis brings ``setuptools`` to the newest version available.\n\nNow, we are ready to go. Bootstrap the initial buildout environment::\n\n    $ python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py\n\nand run the buildout command::\n\n    $ bin/buildout\n\nLots of stuff will be downloaded, compiled and installed here.\n\nNote that if you have more than one sandbox for a Zope-based web\napplication, it will probably make sense to share the eggs between the\ndifferent sandboxes.  You can tell zc.buildout to use a central eggs\ndirectory by creating ``~/.buildout/default.cfg`` with the following\ncontents::\n\n    [buildout]\n    eggs-directory = /home/bruno/buildout-eggs\n\nIf you happen to change the values in `buildout.cfg`, you have to\n'rebuild' the environment by running ``bin/buildout`` again.\n\n\nRunning the site\n****************\n\nYou can start Zope, Plone and psj with the following command::\n\n  $ bin/instance start\n\nThis will start the server process and send it back in the\nbackground. Stop the server with::\n\n  $ bin/instance stop\n\nIf you do not want the server process to detach from the running\nterminal, you can start it like this::\n\n  $ bin/instance fg\n\nIn this case you can stop the server by pressing CTRL-C.\n\nDo::\n\n  $bin/instance --help\n\nto get a complete list of things you can do with the start script.\n\n\nLogin\n*****\n\nAfter starting the server, you can reach it with your browser at\n\n  http://localhost:8080/\n\nTo log into the site, go to \n\n  http://localhost:8080/manage\n\nand enter the credentials as in buildout.cfg. By default the username\nand password are both ``admin``.\n\nThis way you reach the Zope Management Interface (ZMI), where you can\nmanage your running Zope instance.\n\n\n\nSponsors/Credits\n****************\n\nInitial programming was undertaken on behalf of the \"Stiftung Deutsche\nGeisteswissenschaftliche Institute im Ausland\" (Foundation German\nHumanities Institutes Abroad) for the publication platform\nhttp://www.perspectivia.net.\n\nFunding was provided by the German \"Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und\nForschung\" (Federal Ministry of Education and Research).\n\nThe programming was coordinated by the ``Fafalter GmbH``, Duesseldorf,\nGermany, namely Ruth and Bories von dem Bussche.\n\nMany thanks to all these institutions and persons!\n\n\nChangelog\n*********\n\n0.1 (2008-12-09)\n================\n\n* Pinned down versions in `versions.cfg`.\n\n* Initial version\n\n\nDownload\n********",
