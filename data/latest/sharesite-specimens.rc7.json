    "description": "*******************\nsharesite.specimens\n*******************\n\nThis package, ``sharesite.specimens``, provides specimen search and retrieval\nfor the Sinai-Helmsley Alliances for Research Excellence (SHARE).\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your\nproject, adding this package as an egg.  You don't need a ZCML slug because it\nuses z3c.autoinclude.plugin with the Plone target.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nWhat follows is a log of changes from release to release.  Where issue\nidentifiers appear, you can find more about them by visiting this project's\nissue tracker at TBD.\n\n1.0.9 — Fix Specimen Types and Hospital Names\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to Heather Kincaid we've got a better way to figure out what the specimen\ncollection type really is for the New Cedars-Sinai specimens, so this release\nfixes that.  In addition, Heather noticed that we already have specimens (via\nUNC) for \"Mass Gen\", so the specimens we added as \"MGH\" should be \"Mass Gen\".\n\n\n1.0.8 — MOAR BOWEL DISEASE!\n---------------------------\n\nThis release adds some Cedars-Sinai specimens, but *not* the ones that were\nremoved in 1.0.7; these are different Cedars-Sinai specimens, allegedly.  It\nalso adds MGH specimens.\n\n\n1.0.7 — Un-Cedars-Sinai\n-----------------------\n\nThis release removes the specimens from Cedars-Sinai.  Apparently they were\nalready included from the UNC specimens loaded back in 1.0.0.\n\n\n1.0.6 — Cedars-Sinai\n--------------------\n\nThis release adds the specimens dumped out of Cedars-Sinai.\n\n\n1.0.5 — Participants, Not Protocols\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis release changes the labels of \"protocol ID\" to \"participant ID\".  It also\nreally removes commas from years.\n\n\n1.0.4 — I Was Born in 1,969\n---------------------------\n\nThis release removes the comma from years in specimen collection pages.\n\n\n1.0.3 — Spelling Errors\n-----------------------\n\nThis release fixes the spelling of Crohn's Disease.  (It previously appeared\nas \"Chron's Disease\".)\n\n\n1.0.2 — More Columns\n--------------------\n\nThis releases add the specimen collection type (blood) and ethnicity to the\nfaceted selectors as well as the results table.\n\n\n1.0.1 — Protocol ID\n-------------------\n\nThis release adds the protocol ID as a column heading on specimens faceted\nlisting.\n\n\n1.0.0 — Released\n----------------\n\nInitial, released release.\n\n\n0.0.0 — Unreleased\n------------------\n\nInitial, unreleased release.\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright © 2013 by the California Institute of Technology.
