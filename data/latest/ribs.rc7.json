Pyribs\nimplements the highly modular _Rapid Illumination of Behavior Space (RIBS)_\nframework for QD optimization. Pyribs is also the official implementation of\nCovariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME), Covariance Matrix Adaptation\nMAP-Elites via a Gradient Arborescence (CMA-MEGA), Covariance Matrix Adaptation\nMAP-Annealing (CMA-MAE), and scalable variants of CMA-MAE.\n\n## Overview\n\n![Types of Optimization](readme_assets/optimization_types.png)\n\n[Quality diversity (QD) optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04322) is a\nsubfield of optimization where solutions generated cover every point in a\n_measure_ space while simultaneously maximizing (or minimizing) a single\n_objective_. QD algorithms within the MAP-Elites family of QD algorithms produce\nheatmaps (archives) as output where each cell contains the best discovered\nrepresentative of a region in measure space.\n\n> In the QD literature, measure function outputs have also been referred to as\n> \"behavioral characteristics,\" \"behavior descriptors,\" or \"feature\n> descriptors.\"\n\nRecent years have seen the development of a large number of QD algorithms. To\nrepresent these and future algorithms, we have developed the highly modular RIBS\nframework. RIBS divides a QD algorithm into three components:\n\n- An **archive**, which saves generated solutions within measure space.\n- One or more **emitters**, where each emitter is an algorithm which generates\n  new candidate solutions and responds to feedback about how the solutions were\n  evaluated and how they were inserted into the archive.\n- A **scheduler** which controls the interaction of the **archive** and\n  **emitters**. The **scheduler** also provides an interface for requesting new\n  candidate solutions and telling the algorithm how candidates performed.\n\nBy interchanging these components, a user can compose a large number of QD\nalgorithms.\n\nPyribs is an implementation of the RIBS framework designed to support a wide\nrange of users, from beginners entering the field to experienced researchers\nseeking to develop new algorithms. Pyribs achieves these goals by embodying\nthree principles:\n\n- **Simple:** Centered _only_ on components that are absolutely necessary to run\n  a QD algorithm, allowing users to combine the framework with other software\n  frameworks.\n- **Flexible:** Capable of representing a wide range of current and future QD\n  algorithms, allowing users to easily create or modify components.\n- **Accessible:** Easy to install and learn, particularly for beginners with\n  limited computational resources.\n\nIn contrast to other QD libraries, pyribs is \"bare-bones.\" For example, like\n[pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/), pyribs focuses solely on optimizing\nfixed-dimensional continuous domains. Focusing on this one commonly-occurring\nproblem allows us to optimize the library for performance as well as ease of\nuse. Refer to the list of [additional QD libraries](#additional-qd-libraries)\nbelow if you need greater performance or have additional use cases.\n\nFollowing the RIBS framework (shown in the figure below), a standard algorithm\nin pyribs operates as follows:\n\n1. The user calls the `ask()` method on the scheduler. The scheduler requests\n   solutions from each emitter by calling the emitter's `ask()` method.\n2. The user evaluates solutions to obtain the objective and measure values.\n3. The user passes the evaluations to the scheduler's `tell()` method. The\n   scheduler adds the solutions into the archive and receives feedback. The\n   scheduler passes this feedback along with the evaluated solutions to each\n   emitter's `tell()` method, and each emitter then updates its internal state.\n\n![The RIBS framework](readme_assets/ribs.png)\n\n## Paper\n\nTwo years after the initial release of pyribs, we released a paper which\nelaborates on the RIBS framework and the design decisions behind pyribs! For\nmore information on this paper, see [here](https://pyribs.org/paper).\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use pyribs in your research, please cite it as follows. Note that you\nwill need to include the\n[hyperref](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Hyperlinks#Linking_web_addresses)\npackage in order to use the `\\url` command.

Fontaine and David H. Lee and Yulun Zhang and Nivedit Reddy Balam and Nathaniel Dennler and Sujay S. Garlanka and Nikitas Dimitri Klapsis and Stefanos Nikolaidis},\n  year={2023},\n  eprint={2303.00191},\n  archivePrefix={arXiv},\n  primaryClass={cs.NE}\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere we show an example application of CMA-ME in pyribs. To initialize the\nalgorithm, we first create:\n\n- A 2D **GridArchive** where each dimension contains 20 cells across the range\n  [-1, 1].\n- Three instances of **EvolutionStrategyEmitter**, all of which start from the\n  search point **0** in 10-dimensional space and a Gaussian sampling\n  distribution with standard deviation 0.1.\n- A **Scheduler** that combines the archive and emitters together.\n\nAfter initializing the components, we optimize (pyribs maximizes) the negative\n10-D Sphere function for 1000 iterations. Users of\n[pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/) will be familiar with the ask-tell\ninterface (which pyribs adopted). First, the user must `ask` the scheduler for\nnew candidate solutions. After evaluating the solution, they `tell` the\nscheduler the objectives and measures of each candidate solution. The algorithm\nthen populates the archive and makes decisions on where to sample solutions\nnext. Our toy example uses the first two parameters of the search space as\nmeasures.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom ribs.archives import GridArchive\nfrom ribs.emitters import EvolutionStrategyEmitter\nfrom ribs.schedulers import Scheduler\n\narchive = GridArchive(\n    solution_dim=10,\n    dims=[20, 20],\n    ranges=[(-1, 1), (-1, 1)],\n)\nemitters = [\n    EvolutionStrategyEmitter(\n        archive,\n        x0=[0.0] * 10,\n        sigma0=0.1,\n    ) for _ in range(3)\n]\nscheduler = Scheduler(archive, emitters)\n\nfor itr in range(1000):\n    solutions = scheduler.ask()\n\n    # Optimize the 10D negative Sphere function.\n    objective_batch = -np.sum(np.square(solutions), axis=1)\n\n    # Measures: first 2 coordinates of each 10D solution.\n    measures_batch = solutions[:, :2]\n\n    scheduler.tell(objective_batch, measures_batch)\n```\n\nTo visualize this archive with Matplotlib, we then use the\n`grid_archive_heatmap` function from `ribs.visualize`.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom ribs.visualize import grid_archive_heatmap\n\ngrid_archive_heatmap(archive)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![Sphere heatmap](readme_assets/sphere_heatmap.png)\n\nFor more information, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.pyribs.org/).\n\n## Installation\n\npyribs supports Python 3.7 and above.
