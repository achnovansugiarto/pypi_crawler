    "description": "osmqa-parser\n============\n\nAn [imposm parser](https://github.com/omniscale/imposm) for\n[OSM QA tiles](https://osmlab.github.io/osm-qa-tiles/). `osmqa-parser` was\nwritten for use with [tile-reduce-py](https://github.com/jwass/tile-reduce-py)\nand [osmgraph](https://github.com/mapkin/osmgraph).\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe parser should be used with an `imposm` importer such as the one found in\n`osmgraph`.\n\n\nData Model Caveats\n------------------\nOSM QA tiles are delivered as\n[Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/). It is\nimpossible to exactly reconstruct the original OSM data from a vector tile.\n\nBecause ways in a QA tile contain a coordinate sequence instead of a node\nsequence, we can't distinguish different nodes that have the same tile\ncoordinate. `osmqa-parser` assigns unique node IDs based on tile coordinate.\nAs a result, it's possible we introduce false intersections which arise when\ntwo ways have different nodes that have the same coordinates. Also, different\nnodes that fall on the same tile coordinate will have identical node IDs,\nwhich usually means their tags are merged together as one.\n\n\nGoes Great With\n---------------\n* [osmgraph](https://github.com/mapkin/osmgraph)\n* [imposm](https://github.com/omniscale/imposm)\n* [tile-reduce-py](https://github.com/jwass/tile-reduce-py)\n\n\nSee Also\n--------\n* [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/)\n* [imposm-parser](https://github.com/omniscale/imposm-parser)",
