So all dependencies of a commit can be\nprogrammatically inferred by running git-blame on the lines the commit\nchanges, plus however many lines of context make sense for the use case\nof this particular dependency analysis.\n\nTherefore the dependency calculation is impacted by a “fuzz” factor\nparameter (c.f.\n`patch(1) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)>`__), i.e. the\nnumber of lines of context which are considered necessary for the\ncommit’s diff to cleanly apply.\n\nAs with many dependency relationships, these dependencies form edges in\na DAG (directed acyclic graph) whose nodes correspond to commits. Note\nthat a node can only depend on a subset of its ancestors.\n\nCaveat\n~~~~~~\n\nIt is important to be aware that any dependency graph inferred by\n``git-deps`` may be semantically incomplete; for example it would not\nauto-detect dependencies between a commit A which changes code and\nanother commit B which changes documentation or tests to reflect the\ncode changes in commit A. Therefore ``git-deps`` should not be used with\nblind faith. For more details, see `the section on Textual vs. semantic\n(in)dependence <#textual-vs-semantic-independence>`__ below.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nSometimes it is useful to understand the nature of parts of this\ndependency graph, as its nature will impact the success or failure of\noperations including merge, rebase, cherry-pick etc. Please see `the\n``USE-CASES.md`` file <USE-CASES.md>`__ for more details.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPlease see `the ``INSTALL.md`` file <INSTALL.md>`__.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPlease see `the ``USAGE.md`` file <USAGE.md>`__.\n\nTextual vs. semantic (in)dependence\n-----------------------------------\n\nAstute readers will note that textual independence as detected by\n``git-deps`` is not the same as semantic / logical independence. Textual\nindependence means that the changes can be applied in any order without\nincurring conflicts, but this is not a reliable indicator of logical\nindependence.\n\nFor example a change to a function and corresponding changes to the\ntests and/or documentation for that function would typically exist in\ndifferent files. So if those changes were in separate commits within a\nbranch, running ``git-deps`` on the commits would not detect any\ndependency between them even though they are logically related, because\nchanges in different files (or even in different areas of the same\nfiles) are textually independent.\n\nSo in this case, ``git-deps`` would not behave exactly how we might\nwant. And for as long as AI is an unsolved problem, it is very unlikely\nthat it will ever develop totally reliable behaviour. So does that mean\n``git-deps`` is useless? Absolutely not!\n\nFirstly, when `best\npractices <https://crealytics.com/blog/5-reasons-keeping-git-commits-small/>`__\nfor `commit\nstructuring <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Structural_split_of_changes>`__\nare adhered to, changes which are strongly logically related should be\nplaced within the same commit anyway. So in the example above, a change\nto a function and corresponding changes to the tests and/or\ndocumentation for that function should all be within a single commit.\n(Although this is not the only valid approach; for a more advanced\nmeta-history grouping mechanism, see\n```git-dendrify`` <https://github.com/bennorth/git-dendrify>`__.)\n\nSecondly, whilst textual independence does not imply logical\nindependence, the converse is expected to be more commonly true: logical\nindependence often implies textual independence (or stated another way,\ntextual dependence often implies logical dependence). So while it might\nnot be too uncommon for ``git-deps`` to fail to detect the dependency\nbetween logically-related changes, it should be rarer that it\nincorrectly infers a dependency between logically unrelated changes. In\nother words, its false negatives are generally expected to be more\ncommon than its false positives. As a result it is likely to be more\nuseful in determining a lower bound on dependencies than an upper bound.\nHaving said that, more research is needed on this.\n\nThirdly, it is often unhelpful to allow `the quest for the perfect\nbecome the enemy of the\ngood <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good>`__ - a\ntool does not have to be perfect to be useful; it only has to be better\nthan performing the same task without the tool.\n\nFurther discussion on some of these points can be found in `an old\nthread from the git mailing\nlist <https://public-inbox.org/git/20160528112417.GD11256@pacific.linksys.moosehall/>`__.\n\nUltimately though, `“the proof is in the\npudding” <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_proof_is_in_the_pudding>`__,\nso try it out and see!\n\nDevelopment / support / feedback\n--------------------------------\n\nPlease see `the ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nPlease see `the ``HISTORY.md`` file <HISTORY.md>`__.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nSpecial thanks to `SUSE <https://suse.com>`__ for partially sponsoring\nthe development of this software.
