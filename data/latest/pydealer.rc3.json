    "description": "==============================\nPyDealer: Playing Card Package\n==============================\n\n|pd| is a simple to use Python package for \"simulating\" decks of standard playing cards (also known as a |fd|). PyDealer let's you easily create ``Deck`` instances, each containing a full 52 card deck of playing cards. Each card is a separate ``Card`` instance, with a name, value, suit, and abbreviation. There is also the ``Stack`` class, which is useful for creating hands, or discard piles, etc. It is the backbone of the PyDealer package, and actually the ``Deck`` class is just a subclass of the ``Stack`` class.\n\n|pd| could possibly be used as part of a CLI (command line interface) card-based game, or even a graphical game as well, I suppose. It may also be of interest to beginner Python programmers, since it's a relatively simple package, which I created as a way to learn Python, packaging, testing, documentation (Sphinx), etc. I even ended up learning how to use Git a bit, which I must say was slightly frustrating at first. This package has taught me a lot, and maybe someone else can benefit from it as well. Or maybe not. Either way, here it is.\n\nThe PyDealer package can be found at the `Python Package Index`_, and should be downloaded from there, and, ideally, installed with `pip`_.\n\n**Note to Developers**\n\nIf you want to work on this project, please make sure you are working on the latest version of the `dev branch <https://github.com/Trebek/pydealer/tree/dev>`_, and make your pull requests to that branch. Thanks.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nFull documentation for PyDealer can be found on readthedocs.org:\n\n`http://pydealer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ <http://pydealer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_\n\n\nQuick Usage Example\n===================\n\nHere is a quick example, using IDLE, demonstrating how to construct a new |deck| instance, representing a full |fd| of cards, as well as how to shuffle the deck, and deal some cards (7 of them) from it, to a hand. Then we'll print a listing of the contents of the hand, in a human readable way, with a simple print statement.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import pydealer\n    >>> deck = pydealer.Deck()\n    >>> deck.shuffle()\n    >>> hand = deck.deal(7)\n    >>> hand.sort()\n    >>> print hand\n    2 of Diamonds\n    5 of Hearts\n    9 of Hearts\n    9 of Spades\n    Jack of Spades\n    King of Clubs\n    Ace of Clubs\n\n\nInstall/Update/Uninstall with `pip`_\n====================================\n\nI recommend downloading and installing `pip`_, if you haven't already, and using that to install PyDealer, from the `Python Package Index`_.\n\nEnter one of the following commands into your \\*nix Bash or Windows Command Prompt (after installing `pip`_).\n\nInstall\n-------\n::\n\n    $ pip install pydealer\n\nUpdate\n------\n::\n\n    $ pip install pydealer -U\n\nUninstall\n---------\n::\n\n    $ pip uninstall pydealer\n\n\nRelevant Links\n==============\n\n.. | `PyDealer Documentation <https://readthedocs.org/>`_\n\n| `Standard 52-card deck Wikipedia Article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck>`_\n| `Playing card Wikipedia Article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card>`_\n\n\n.. Replacement Text/Links\n.. ======================\n\n.. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/\n.. _Python Package Index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydealer/\n\n.. |pd| replace:: PyDealer\n.. |fd| replace:: French Deck\n\n.. |card| replace:: ``Card``\n.. |deck| replace:: ``Deck``\n.. |stack| replace:: ``Stack``",
