    "description": "Introduction\n==========\nPython implementation of the ANT, ANT+, and ANT-FS protocols. For more\ninformation about ANT, see http://www.thisisant.com/.\n\nCan be used to communicate with ANT nodes using an ANT stick (USB).\n\nThis project came to be when I tried to download data for analysis from my\nANT+/ANT-FS enabled running watch under GNU/Linux. This eventually lead me to\nattempting to port ANT_LIB and ANT_DLL (by Dynastream) to Linux. However, I\ndidn't quite like the library, the protocol is well documented and trivial to\nimplement, and I was going to have to write a ctypes-based wrapper afterwards\nsince I was only going to use the library from Python. Thus, I decided to\nwrite a pure Python implementation.\n\n\nContact\n==========\nYou can reach me via e-Mail at:\n    ehyde at codinghyde com\n\n\nDocumentation\n==========\nDocumentation will be a bit scarse for the time being, but everything public\nshould have at least a docstring by the time I make the first stable release.\n\n\nLicense\n==========\nReleased under the MIT/X11 license. See LICENSE for the full text.\n\n\nInstall\n==========\n% python setup.py install\n\n\nDevelop\n==========\nSee DEVELOP for details.",
