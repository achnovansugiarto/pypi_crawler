    "description": "# KML 2 GPX for Private Radar extractions\n\nConverts KML files from [Private Radar](https://www.private-radar.com/)\nflights list to a GPX file usable with, for example,\n[ayvri](https://ayvri.com/).\n\n## KML input\n\n1. Export a Private Radar flight in KML format. It will contain 2 layers:\n`Altitude` and `Elevation`. We will only keep `Altitude` in the GPX file.\n2. Note the total **start** and end times of the flight (not the block times)\n3. Run the converter:\n   ```bash\n   python -m kml2gpx \\\n       kml \\\n       --input ${INPUT_KML_FILE} \\\n       --output ${OUTPUT_GPX_FILE} \\\n       --start ${FLIGHT_START_DATETIME} \\\n       --end ${FLIGHT_END_DATETIME}\n   ```\n\n   * If multiple input files are given, there must be as many start and end\n   times. The results will be stored in a single file.\n   * If output is not given, it will be the (first) input file name with the\n   `.gpx` extension.\n   * Start and end date times must be in ISO format, for example:\n   `2022-06-06T10:53:00+02:00`\n   * As the time at each point is missing from the exported KML file, we\n   consider all points being equally spread between the start and end time.\n   (*I know it's not the case*)\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\npython -m kml2gpx.main \\\n    kml \\\n    --input LFLG-LFLW.kml \\\n    --start 2022-06-06T08:47:00 \\\n    --end 2022-06-06T10:53:00\n```\n\n\n## Private Radar input\n\nThis requires to know how to extract a token from your browser.\n\n1. Get the details to connect Private Radar instance:\n\n   * The base URL is, for example, `https://xxx.private-radar.com/`\n   where `xxx` is the name of your aero club.\n\n   * To get your authentication token:\n\n     1. Log into your Private Radar instance\n     2. Open the developer web console in your browser (F12 on Windows)\n     3. Open the `Network` tab in the web console\n     4. Refresh the Private Radar page\n     5. In the `Network` tab, click on any line where the first column starts\n     with `get` (`get`, `get_aircraft`, ...)\n     6. In the `Headers` of that query, look at the `Request headers` and copy\n     the value of `Authorization` field\n\n2. Create a file named `kml2gpx.ini` with the following content:\n\n   ```ini\n   [PRIVATE_RADAR]\n   url = <base URL to Private Radar>\n   token = <Authorization token>\n   ```\n\n   For example:\n\n   ```ini\n   [PRIVATE_RADAR]\n   url = https://xxx.private-radar.com/\n   token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n   ```\n\n   The file can be stored in your home directory or in the working directory of\n   the converter.\n\n3. You can then:\n   * List the last flights using:\n     ```bash\n     python -m kml2gpx private-radar --list --nb 50\n     ```\n\n   * Extract the GPX of a specific flight, using its ID\n     ```bash\n     python -m kml2gpx private-radar --flight XXXXXX\n     ```\n\n   * Extract the GPX of one of last flights, using a negative ID:\n     -1 for the last flight, -2 for the flight before, ...\n\n     ```bash\n     python -m kml2gpx private-radar --flight -1\n     ```\n\n## Work in progress\n\n* Prepare a basic UI supporting both Private Radar listings and drag & drop.\n* Use an authentication process to get the authorization token automatically\n",
