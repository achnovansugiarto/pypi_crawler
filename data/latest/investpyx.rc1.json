These are some of the features that currently lead \ninvestpy to be one of the most consistent packages when it comes to financial data retrieval.\n\n[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/investpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/)\n[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/investpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/)\n[![Package Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/investpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/)\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/workflows/run_tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/actions?query=workflow%3Arun_tests)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/investpy/badge/?version=latest)](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/)\n[![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/alvarobartt/investpy/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/alvarobartt/investpy)\n\n**If you want to support the project, you can buy the developer a coffee. More information at: [buy-me-a-coffee](https://github.com/alvarobartt/buy-me-a-coffee)**\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alvarobartt\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/default-orange.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" height=\"41\" width=\"174\"></a></p>\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python 3.6 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:\n\n``$ pip install investpy``\n\nAdditionally, **if you want to use the latest investpy version instead of the stable one, you can install it from source** with the following command:\n\n``$ pip install git+https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy.git@master``\n\n**The master branch ensures the user that the most updated version will always be working and fully operative** so as not to wait until the \nthe stable release comes out (which eventually may take some time depending on the number of issues to solve).\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nEven though some investpy usage examples are presented on the [docs](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/usage.html), \nsome basic functionality will be sorted out with sample Python code blocks. Additionally, more usage examples \ncan be found under [examples/](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/tree/master/examples) directory, which \ncontains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks on how to use investpy and handle its data.\n\n**Extended Feature: Rotating Proxy with Zyte (Crawlera)**\n\n### Using Zyte to remove request limitation\n\nYou can pass your Zyte (Previously Crawlera) API to automatically setup proxy rotation. \n\n```python\nimport investpy\nkey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\ndf = investpy.technical.moving_averages(api_key=key,\n                                        name='EUR/USD',\n                                        country='none',\n                                        product_type='currency_cross',\n                                        interval='1min')\n\nprint(df.head())\n```\n**Note: This package is for testing purpose only, the proxy is only implemented on technical indicators at the moment**\n\n\n### Recent/Historical Data Retrieval\n\ninvestpy allows the user to **download both recent and historical data from any financial product indexed** \n(stocks, funds, ETFs, currency crosses, certificates, bonds, commodities, indices, and cryptos). In \nthe example presented below, the historical data from the past years of a stock is retrieved. \n\n```python\nimport investpy\n\ndf = investpy.get_stock_historical_data(stock='AAPL',\n                                        country='United States',\n                                        from_date='01/01/2010',\n                                        to_date='01/01/2020')\nprint(df.head())\n```\n```{r, engine='python', count_lines}\n             Open   High    Low  Close     Volume Currency\nDate                                                      \n2010-01-04  30.49  30.64  30.34  30.57  123432176      USD\n2010-01-05  30.66  30.80  30.46  30.63  150476160      USD\n2010-01-06  30.63  30.75  30.11  30.14  138039728      USD\n2010-01-07  30.25  30.29  29.86  30.08  119282440      USD\n2010-01-08  30.04  30.29  29.87  30.28  111969192      USD\n```\n\nTo get to know all the available recent and historical data extraction functions provided by \ninvestpy, and also, parameter tuning, please read the docs.\n\n### Search Data\n\n**Investing.com search engine is completely integrated** with investpy, which means that any available \nfinancial product (quote) can be easily found. The search function allows the user to tune the parameters \nto adjust the search results to their needs, where both product types and countries from where the \nproducts are, can be specified. **All the search functionality can be easily used**, for example, as \npresented in the following piece of code:\n\n```python\nimport investpy\n\nsearch_results = investpy.search_quotes(text='apple',\n                                        products=['stocks'],\n                                        countries=['united states'],\n                                        n_results=10)\n```\n\nRetrieved search results will be a `list` of `investpy.utils.search_obj.SearchObj` class instances. To get to know \nwhich are the available functions and attributes of the returned search results, please read the related \ndocumentation at [Search Engine Documentation](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/search_api.html). So on, those \nsearch results let the user retrieve both recent and historical data from that concrete product, its \ninformation, etc., as presented in the  piece of code below:\n\n```python\n for search_result in search_results[:1]:\n   print(search_result)\n   search_result.retrieve_historical_data(from_date='01/01/2019', to_date='01/01/2020')\n   print(search_result.data.head())\n```\n```{r, engine='python', count_lines}\n{\"id_\": 6408, \"name\": \"Apple Inc\", \"symbol\": \"AAPL\", \"country\": \"united states\", \"tag\": \"apple-computer-inc\", \"pair_type\": \"stocks\", \"exchange\": \"NASDAQ\"}\n\n              Open    High     Low   Close    Volume\nDate                                                \n2019-01-02  154.89  158.85  154.23  157.92  37039736\n2019-01-03  143.98  145.72  142.00  142.19  91312192\n2019-01-04  144.53  148.55  143.80  148.26  58607072\n2019-01-07  148.70  148.83  145.90  147.93  54777764\n2019-01-08  149.56  151.82  148.52  150.75  41025312\n\n```\n\n### Crypto Currencies Data Retrieval\n\nCryptocurrencies support has recently been included, to let the user retrieve data and information from any \navailable crypto at Investing.com. Please note that some cryptocurrencies do not have available data indexed \nat Investing.com so that it can not be retrieved using investpy either, even though they are just a few, \nconsider it.\n\nAs already presented previously, **historical data retrieval using investpy is really easy**. The piece of code \npresented below shows how to retrieve the past years of historical data from Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n````python\nimport investpy\n\ndata = investpy.get_crypto_historical_data(crypto='bitcoin',\n                                           from_date='01/01/2014',\n                                           to_date='01/01/2019')\n\nprint(data.head())\n````\n```{r, engine='python', count_lines}\n             Open    High    Low   Close  Volume Currency\nDate                                                     \n2014-01-01  805.9   829.9  771.0   815.9   10757      USD\n2014-01-02  815.9   886.2  810.5   856.9   12812      USD\n2014-01-03  856.9   888.2  839.4   884.3    9709      USD\n2014-01-04  884.3   932.2  848.3   924.7   14239      USD\n2014-01-05  924.7  1029.9  911.4  1014.7   21374      USD\n```\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the **complete investpy documentation** at [Documentation](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/).\n\n---\n\n## Related projects\n\nSince investpy is intended to retrieve data from different financial products as indexed in Investing.com, \nthe **development of some support modules which implement an additional functionality based on investpy data**, \nis presented. Note that **anyone can contribute to this section** by creating any package, module, or utility that \nuses investpy. So on, the ones already created are going to be presented, since they are intended to be used \ncombined with investpy:\n\n- [pyrtfolio](https://github.com/alvarobartt/pyrtfolio/): is a Python package to generate stock portfolios.\n- [trendet](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet/): is a Python package for trend detection on stock time-series data.\n\nIf you developed an interesting/useful project based on investpy data, please open an issue to let me know to \ninclude it in this section.\n\n---\n\n## Contribute - [![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/alvarobartt/investpy/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/alvarobartt/investpy)\n\nAs this is an open-source project it is **open to contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, \nenhancements, and ideas**. There is an open tab of [issues](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/issues) where \nanyone can open new issues if needed or navigate through them to solve them or contribute to its solving. \nRemember that issues are not threads to describe multiple problems, this does not mean that issues can not \nbe discussed, but so to keep structured project management, the same issue should not describe different \nproblems, just the main one and some nested/related errors that may be found.\n\n---\n\n## Citation\n\nWhen citing this repository on your scientific publications please use the following **BibTeX** citation:\n\n```\n@misc{investpy,\n    author = {Alvaro Bartolome del Canto},\n    title = {investpy - Financial Data Extraction from Investing.com with Python},\n    year = {2018-2021},\n    publisher = {GitHub},\n    journal = {GitHub Repository},\n    howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy}},\n}\n```\n\nWhen citing this repository on any other social media, please use the following citation:\n\n```\ninvestpy - Financial Data Extraction from Investing.com with Python developed by Alvaro Bartolome del Canto\n```\n\nAnd include a mention (so that I can see your work!) to me at any of my social network profiles:\n\n- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/alvarobartt\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/alvarobartt\n- GitHub: https://github.com/alvarobartt\n\nIf applicable also mention the source from where the data is retrieved, Investing.com.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis Python package has been made for **research purposes** to fit the needs that Investing.com does not cover, \nso this package works like an Application Programming Interface (API) of Investing.com developed in an **altruistic way**.\n\nConclude that **investpy is not affiliated in any way to Investing.com or any dependant company**, the only \nrequirement specified by Investing.com to develop this package was to \"mention the source where data is \nretrieved from\".\n\n\n",
