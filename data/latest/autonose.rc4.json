    "description": "Autonose\r\n========\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://gfxmonk.net/dist/status/project/autonose.png\r\n\r\nAutonose is an autotest-like tool for python, using the excellent nosetest\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Re-run tests instantly when you save a file\r\n- Re-runs only tests that have failed or depend on changed files\r\n- GTK GUI (console fallback for other platforms or by passing in --console)\r\n- focus mode: keep running a single test (GUI only)\r\n\r\nTo activate focus mode, click the large grey circle next to the test result.\r\nTo go back to normal mode, click the \"#\" in the status bar (next to the\r\nnumber of tests run).\r\n\r\nNote: on a Mac, to get immediate filesystem notification you may need to install\r\nwatchdog using ``easy_install``, as it needs to compile a native extension which\r\nisn't included in the 0install package.\r\n\r\nAdvanced use:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nnosetests has a lot of options and plugins. autonose tries to work as best\r\nit can with them, but be warned that some plugins will interfere with autonose\r\n(particularly any that do their own output or manage test results).\r\n\r\nHowever, you can pass any options you want to nose by prefixing them with ``-x``,\r\nor by using ``--config=nose.cfg`` if you have a config file.\r\n(e.g. to turn on doctest, you should pass ``-x--with-doctest`` to autonose)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n------\r\n\r\nAutotest does not (currently):\r\n\r\n- understand dynamic imports (use of ``__import__``)\r\n- track any file types other than ``.py``",
