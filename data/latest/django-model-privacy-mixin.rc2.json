    "description": "# Django Model Privacy MixIn\n\n[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is one of the most popular Python web frameworks today. Importantly it provides an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) permitting us to define models as Python classes that Django maps to a database representations for us. \n\nA common need on-line today is to maintain privacy of user data. Such privacy needs to be managed across any website that stores user information, at every level possible. We are all tired of reading about data breaches that sees some hack suck all the users, account names, full names and email addresses and whatever else from some insecure database.\n\nThis Django model MixIn works at one level, a rather low one in the Django framework, to securely deny access to private data to the wrong people.\n\nTo use it, simply mix it in to your model definition. Consider the basic Django example of:\n\nThe basic Django example of model:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n```\n\ncan be extended thusly:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django_model_privacy_mixin import PrivacyMixIn\n\nclass Person(PrivacyMixIn, models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n```\n\nOf course that is not enough, you've now mixed it in, but haven't told the PrivacyMixIn what is and what isn't private and to and from whom. For that we simply define a `visibility_*` field for any field we wish to make private. This is expected to be a Django [BitField](https://pypi.org/project/django-bitfield/). Further you will need users and accounts for privacy management to be meaningful (otherwise you only have two simple states, displayed and not displayed, and don't need the complexity of this or any other MixIn).\n\nThe first step is to define a set of permissions or visibility scopes. This is the example straight out of BitField documentation:\n\n```Python\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    flags = BitField(flags=(\n        ('awesome_flag', 'Awesome Flag!'),\n        ('flaggy_foo', 'Flaggy Foo'),\n        ('baz_bar', 'Baz (bar)'),\n    ))\n```\n\nThis MixIn uses such a set of flags as visibility rules. So it is prudent to separate the definitions:\n\n```Python\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    x = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    y = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    z = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    \n    rules = (\n        ('rule_1', 'Everyone'),\n        ('rule_2', 'Group Members'),\n        ('rule_3', 'Staff')\n    )\n    \n    visibility__x = BitField(rules)\n    visibility__y = BitField(rules)\n    visibility__z = BitField(rules)    \n```\n\nThe fields and rules though need to follow a naming convention so that the MixIn can interpret them. The conventions are as follows:\n\n### Fields\n\nA BitField that has the the same name as another field in the model *but* with `visibility_` as a prefix, defines the visibility rules for that field. That is `visibility__x = BitField(rules)` defines the rules for a filed, `x`. Fields that don't have a matching `visibility_` BitField won't be managed by this MixIn. They will be left alone.\n\n### Rules\n\nBtiField accepts a list of tuples of the form `(flag, label)`.  This MixIn acts only on flags that are named as follows:\n\n`all` - if this flag is set, the target field will be visible to all. \n\n`all_*` - where `*` is the name of field on the `auth.User` instance (i.e. of an authorised user) or its extensions (models with a `OneToOneField` relation to `auth.User`). For example `all_is_staff`. If this flag is set then the target field is visible only if the user has an `is_staff` field that is True otherwise it is hidden. These attributes can be on User [extensions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-the-existing-user-model) too. \n\n`all_not_*` - same as `all_*` just its inverse. Will hide the target field if the `*` field evaluates to True.\n\n`share_*` - if this flag is set, the target field will be visible only to users who share membership of a group defined by the `*` attribute on an `auth.User` instance  (i.e. of an authorised user) or its extensions (as with `all_*`). Where `all_*` provides visibility to all users who have a True `*` attribute, `share_*` expects the `*` attribute to be a [ManyToManyField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#manytomanyfield) and tests if the authorised User and the owner of the record in question are both in that same group (are both members of the set the Many2ManyField defines). For this we need to know the owner of a record.\n\n### Owners\n\nThe `share_*` rule needs to know if the owner of the record being fetched from the database and the user requesting the record share membership in the group `*`. For that it needs to know who owns the record. This must be indicated to the MixIn by providing an `owner` property. For example:\n\n```Python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django_model_privacy_mixin import PrivacyMixIn\n\nclass Person(PrivacyMixIn, models.Model):\n\tuser = models.OneToOneField(User, verbose_name='Username')\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n\n    @property\n    def owner(self) -> User:\n        return self.user\n```\n\n`owner` can of course be a field too, but it's much easier to add a property to any model you wish to add the `PrivacyMixIn` to.\n\nPutting that all together in a rich example, here's one of a `Player` model in which players can be in teams and leagues and where they can be registrars as well (umpires, referees, or such):\n\n```Python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django_model_privacy_mixin import PrivacyMixIn\n\nclass Player(PrivacyMixIn, models.Model):\n    # Player fields\n    nickname = models.CharField('Nickname', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH, unique=True)\n    personal = models.CharField('Personal Name', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH)\n    family = models.CharField('Family Name', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH)\n    email = models.EmailField('Email Address', blank=True, null=True)\n    is_registrar = models.BooleanField('Authorised to record session results?', default=False)\n\n    # Membership fields\n    teams = models.ManyToManyField('Team', related_name='players_in_team') \n    leagues = models.ManyToManyField('League', related_name='players_in_league')\n\n    # account\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, related_name='player')\n\n    # Privacy control (interfaces with django_model_privacy_mixin)\n    visibility = (\n        ('all', 'Everyone'),\n        ('share_leagues', 'League Members'),\n        ('share_teams', 'Team Members'),\n        ('all_is_registrar', 'Registrars'),\n        ('all_is_staff', 'Staff')\n    )\n\n    visibility_nickname = BitField(visibility, default=('all',))\n    visibility_personal = BitField(visibility, default=('all',))\n    visibility_family = BitField(visibility, default=('share_leagues', 'all_is_staff'))\n    visibility_email = BitField(visibility, default=('share_leagues', 'share_teams'))\n\n    @property\n    def owner(self) -> User:\n        return self.user\n```\n\nAnd voila, anyone accessing instances of Player will see the `nickname` and `personal`, but if they are not staff (`is_staff` is True on their `user`) or share a league with `owner`, the `family` name will be replaced by `PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN` (which you can configure but defaults to `<Hidden>` - which BTW won't display unless you [mark it safe](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.safestring.mark_safe)).\n\n### Hiding Data\n\nIf the model has a callable attribute (method) with the name `PrivacyMixIn.HIDE_METHOD` (default `hide`) then any field that should be hidden will be passed to that method which should return the value to display. This permits shades of hiding ... you have control in this method of how the hidden data is presented. In particular you may wish to blur it, or make it simply less precise rather than hiding it completely.\n\nTo illustrate, we can add such  basic method to the Player model above:\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n\nfrom django_model_privacy_mixin import PrivacyMixIn\n\nclass Player(PrivacyMixIn, models.Model):\n    # Player fields\n    nickname = models.CharField('Nickname', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH, unique=True)\n    personal = models.CharField('Personal Name', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH)\n    family = models.CharField('Family Name', max_length=MAX_NAME_LENGTH)\n    email = models.EmailField('Email Address', blank=True, null=True)\n    is_registrar = models.BooleanField('Authorised to record session results?', default=False)\n\n    # Membership fields\n    teams = models.ManyToManyField('Team', related_name='players_in_team') \n    leagues = models.ManyToManyField('League', related_name='players_in_league')\n\n    # account\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, related_name='player')\n\n    # Privacy control (interfaces with django_model_privacy_mixin)\n    visibility = (\n        ('all', 'Everyone'),\n        ('share_leagues', 'League Members'),\n        ('share_teams', 'Team Members'),\n        ('all_is_registrar', 'Registrars'),\n        ('all_is_staff', 'Staff')\n    )\n\n    visibility_nickname = BitField(visibility, default=('all',))\n    visibility_personal = BitField(visibility, default=('all',))\n    visibility_family = BitField(visibility, default=('share_leagues', 'all_is_staff'))\n    visibility_email = BitField(visibility, default=('share_leagues', 'share_teams'))\n\n    def hide(self, field):\n    \t# From the field we can get its current value, the form field and widget if needed.\n        value = getattr(self, field.name)\n        form_field = field.formfield()\n        form_widget = form_field.widget\n    \n    \tif field.name == 'personal':\n    \t\treturn 'John'\n    \telif field.name == 'family':\n    \t\treturn 'Smith'\n    \telif field.name == 'email':\n    \t\treturn PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN\n    \telse:\n    \t\treturn 'Wassup?' # Unhandled condition\n```\n\n`PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN` is the default that is used if this method is not available and it defaults to '<Hidden>' ([marked safe](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/utils/#django.utils.safestring.mark_safe) for you)\n\n### Configuration\n\nPrivacyMixIn has only two configurations:\n\n`PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN` - which is a string that is returned in place of the content of any hidden field.\n\n`PrivacyMixIn.HIDE_EMPTY_FIELD`- If `True` empty fields are also replaced by `PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN` when visibility is denied. Defaults to False. Empty fields are just returned as they are.\n\n### The Internals\n\nThis isn't a big MixIn, it's all in `__init__.py`. But to be clear the MixIn overrides the model's `from_db`method, calling the original method then testing the visibility rules, making and substitutes needed and returning the result. It is intentionally implemented at this low level to minimise risks of data leakage. That is, your whole Django site will not see the hidden fields, you can't accidentally display somewhere, any time Django fetches the data for this model from the database, this MixIn will already have hidden anything that needs hiding.\n\n### Forms - [DANGER Will Robinson DANGER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG0ochx16Dg)\n\nA side effect of simply replacing fields is that if a user has the right to edit the object and save it, then they will see some with the content as `PrivacyMixIn.HIDDEN`. If they save that of course you're letting people from whom data is hidden overwrite it in the database! A **big** NO NO. \n\nThe MixIn thus provides, on the model instances, a method `fields_for_model()`. There are a number of ways you can create forms in Django of course and so it's up to you restrict users form views to the filtered `fields_for_model()`. To illustrate, one simple example, we take(from the documentation for the standard [UpdateView](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#updateview):\n\n```Python\nfrom django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView\nfrom myapp.models import Author\n\nclass AuthorUpdateView(UpdateView):\n    model = Author\n    fields = ['name']\n    template_name_suffix = '_update_form'\n```\n\nand tailor it the Player example above while overriding [`get_object()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/mixins-single-object/#django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.get_object):\n\n```Python\nfrom django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView\nfrom django.forms.models import fields_for_model\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404\nfrom myapp.models import Player\n\nclass PlayerUpdateView(UpdateView):\n    model = Player\n    \n    def get_object(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.pk = self.kwargs['pk']\n        self.obj = get_object_or_404(self.model, pk=self.kwargs['pk'])\n\n        if callable(getattr(self.obj, 'fields_for_model', None)):\n            # Call the PrivacyMixIn's fields_for_model()\n            self.fields = self.obj.fields_for_model()\n        else:\n            # Call the Django's fields_for_model()\n            self.fields = fields_for_model(self.model)\n\n        return self.obj\n```\n\nNow that will present to a user a form to edit a record which is missing the fields that are hidden (that they have no right to see or alter).\n\nOf course there are various ways of rendering forms in Django and you're responsible for ensuring they only show the fields that the PrivacyMixIn says (in `obj.fields_for_model()`) should be shown, it can't predict all the ways you present forms to users.\n",
