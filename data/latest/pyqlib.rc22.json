[Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part.\nA strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)).\nBy modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html).\nAt last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.\n\n\n# Quick Start\n\nThis quick start guide tries to demonstrate\n1. It's very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.\n2. Though with *public data* and *simple models*, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.\n\nHere is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install ``Qlib``, and run LightGBM with ``qrun``. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](#data-preparation).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThis table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:\n|               | install with pip           | install from source  | plot |\n| ------------- |:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:----:|\n| Python 3.7    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.8    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.9    | :x:                   | :heavy_check_mark:   | :x: |\n\n**Note**: \n1. **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment.\n1. Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing ``Qlib`` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to *upgrade* Python to version 3.7 or use `conda`'s Python to install ``Qlib`` from source.\n1. For Python 3.9, `Qlib` supports running workflows such as training models, doing backtest and plot most of the related figures (those included in [notebook](examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb)). However, plotting for the *model performance* is not supported for now and we will fix this when the dependent packages are upgraded in the future.\n1. `Qlib`Requires `tables` package, `hdf5` in tables does not support python3.9. \n\n### Install with pip\nUsers can easily install ``Qlib`` by pip according to the following command.\n\n```bash\n  pip install pyqlib\n```\n\n**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.\n\n### Install from source\nAlso, users can install the latest dev version ``Qlib`` by the source code according to the following steps:\n\n* Before installing ``Qlib`` from source, users need to install some dependencies:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install numpy\n  pip install --upgrade  cython\n  ```\n\n* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib\n    pip install .\n    ```\n  **Note**:  You can install Qlib with `python setup.py install` as well. But it is not the recommended approach. It will skip `pip` and cause obscure problems. For example, **only** the command ``pip install .`` **can** overwrite the stable version installed by ``pip install pyqlib``, while the command ``python setup.py install`` **can't**.\n\n**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment,  comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.\n\n## Data Preparation\nLoad and prepare data by running the following code:\n\n### Get with module\n  ```bash\n  # get 1d data\n  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\n\n  # get 1min data\n  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\n\n  ```\n\n### Get from source\n\n  ```bash\n  # get 1d data\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\n\n  # get 1min data\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\n\n  ```\n\nThis dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in\nthe same repository.\nUsers could create the same dataset with it. [Description of dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector#description-of-dataset)\n\n*Please pay **ATTENTION** that the data is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup), and the data might not be perfect.\nWe recommend users to prepare their own data if they have a high-quality dataset. For more information, users can refer to the [related document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format)*.\n\n### Automatic update of daily frequency data (from yahoo finance)\n  > This step is *Optional* if users only want to try their models and strategies on history data.\n  > \n  > It is recommended that users update the data manually once (--trading_date 2021-05-25) and then set it to update automatically.\n  >\n  > **NOTE**: Users can't incrementally  update data based on the offline data provided by Qlib(some fields are removed to reduce the data size). Users should use [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance) to download Yahoo data from scratch and then incrementally update it.\n  > \n  > For more information, please refer to: [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance)\n\n  * Automatic update of data to the \"qlib\" directory each trading day(Linux)\n      * use *crontab*: `crontab -e`\n      * set up timed tasks:\n\n        ```\n        * * * * 1-5 python <script path> update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir>\n        ```\n        * **script path**: *scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py*\n\n  * Manual update of data\n      ```\n      python scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir> --trading_date <start date> --end_date <end date>\n      ```\n      * *trading_date*: start of trading day\n      * *end_date*: end of trading day(not included)\n\n\n<!-- \n- Run the initialization code and get stock data:\n\n  ```python\n  import qlib\n  from qlib.data import D\n  from qlib.constant import REG_CN\n\n  # Initialization\n  mount_path = \"~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data\"  # target_dir\n  qlib.init(mount_path=mount_path, region=REG_CN)\n\n  # Get stock data by Qlib\n  # Load trading calendar with the given time range and frequency\n  print(D.calendar(start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day')[:2])\n\n  # Parse a given market name into a stockpool config\n  instruments = D.instruments('csi500')\n  print(D.list_instruments(instruments=instruments, start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', as_list=True)[:6])\n\n  # Load features of certain instruments in given time range\n  instruments = ['SH600000']\n  fields = ['$close', '$volume', 'Ref($close, 1)', 'Mean($close, 3)', '$high-$low']\n  print(D.features(instruments, fields, start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day').head())\n  ```\n -->\n\n## Auto Quant Research Workflow\nQlib provides a tool named `qrun` to run the whole workflow automatically (including building dataset, training models, backtest and evaluation). You can start an auto quant research workflow and have a graphical reports analysis according to the following steps: \n\n1. Quant Research Workflow: Run  `qrun` with lightgbm workflow config ([workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml](examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml) as following.\n    ```bash\n      cd examples  # Avoid running program under the directory contains `qlib`\n      qrun benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml\n    ```\n    If users want to use `qrun` under debug mode, please use the following command:\n    ```bash\n    python -m pdb qlib/workflow/cli.py examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml\n    ```\n    The result of `qrun` is as follows, please refer to [Intraday Trading](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/backtest.html) for more details about the result. \n\n    ```bash\n\n    'The following are analysis results of the excess return without cost.'\n                           risk\n    mean               0.000708\n    std                0.005626\n    annualized_return  0.178316\n    information_ratio  1.996555\n    max_drawdown      -0.081806\n    'The following are analysis results of the excess return with cost.'\n                           risk\n    mean               0.000512\n    std                0.005626\n    annualized_return  0.128982\n    information_ratio  1.444287\n    max_drawdown      -0.091078\n    ```\n    Here are detailed documents for `qrun` and [workflow](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html).\n\n2.

To support a flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provides a modularized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow by code. [Here](examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code.\n\n# Main Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research\nQuant investment is an very unique scenario with lots of key challenges to be solved.\nCurrently, Qlib provides some solutions for several of them.\n\n## Forecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns\nAccurate forecasting of the stock price trend is a very important part to construct profitable portfolios.\nHowever, huge amount of data with various formats in the financial market which make it challenging to build forecasting models.\n\nAn increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers, which focus on building forecasting models to mine valuable signals/patterns in complex financial data, are released in `Qlib`\n\n\n### [Quant Model (Paper) Zoo](examples/benchmarks)\n\nHere is a list of models built on `Qlib`.\n- [GBDT based on XGBoost (Tianqi Chen, et al.

Users can find the config files we provide and some details about the model through the [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks) folder. More information can be retrieved at the model files listed above.\n\n`Qlib` provides three different ways to run a single model, users can pick the one that fits their cases best:\n- Users can use the tool `qrun` mentioned above to run a model's workflow based from a config file.\n- Users can create a `workflow_by_code` python script based on the [one](examples/workflow_by_code.py) listed in the `examples` folder.\n\n- Users can use the script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) listed in the `examples` folder to run a model. Here is an example of the specific shell command to be used: `python run_all_model.py run --models=lightgbm`, where the `--models` arguments can take any number of models listed above(the available models can be found  in [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks/)). For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py).\n    - **NOTE**: Each baseline has different environment dependencies, please make sure that your python version aligns with the requirements(e.g. TFT only supports Python 3.6~3.7 due to the limitation of `tensorflow==1.15.0`)\n\n### Run multiple models\n`Qlib` also provides a script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) which can run multiple models for several iterations. (**Note**: the script only support *Linux* for now. Other OS will be supported in the future. Besides, it doesn't support parallel running the same model for multiple times as well, and this will be fixed in the future development too.)\n\nThe script will create a unique virtual environment for each model, and delete the environments after training. Thus, only experiment results such as `IC` and `backtest` results will be generated and stored.\n\nHere is an example of running all the models for 10 iterations:\n```python\npython run_all_model.py run 10\n```\n\nIt also provides the API to run specific models at once. For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py). \n\n## [Adapting to Market Dynamics](examples/benchmarks_dynamic)\n\nDue to the non-stationary nature of the environment of the financial market, the data distribution may change in different periods, which makes the performance of models build on training data decays in the future test data.\nSo adapting the forecasting models/strategies to market dynamics is very important to the model/strategies' performance.\n\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib`.\n- [Rolling Retraining](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/baseline/)\n- [DDG-DA on pytorch (Wendi, et al. AAAI 2022)](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/DDG-DA/)\n\n# Quant Dataset Zoo\nDataset plays a very important role in Quant. Here is a list of the datasets built on `Qlib`:\n\n| Dataset                                    | US Market | China Market |\n| --                                         | --        | --           |\n| [Alpha360](./qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) |  √        |  √           |\n| [Alpha158](./qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) |  √        |  √           |\n\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/alpha.html) is a tutorial to build dataset with `Qlib`.\nYour PR to build new Quant dataset is highly welcomed.\n\n\n# Learning Framework\nQlib is high customizable and a lot of its components are learnable.\nThe learnable components are instances of `Forecast Model` and `Trading Agent`. They are learned based on the `Learning Framework` layer and then applied to multiple scenarios in `Workflow` layer.\nThe learning framework leverages the `Workflow` layer as well(e.g. sharing `Information Extractor`, creating environments based on `Execution Env`).\n\nBased on learning paradigms, they can be categorized into reinforcement learning and supervised learning.\n- For supervised learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/model.html).\n- For reinforcement learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html). Qlib's RL learning framework leverages `Execution Env` in `Workflow` layer to create environments.  It's worth noting that `NestedExecutor` is supported as well. This empowers users to optimize different level of strategies/models/agents together (e.g. optimizing an order execution strategy for a specific portfolio management strategy).\n\n\n# More About Qlib\nIf you want to have a quick glance at the most frequently used components of qlib, you can try notebooks [here](examples/tutorial/).\n\nThe detailed documents are organized in [docs](docs/).\n[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats. \n```bash\ncd docs/\nconda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme -y\n# Otherwise, you can install them with pip\n# pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme\nmake html\n```\nYou can also view the [latest document](http://qlib.readthedocs.io/) online directly.\n\nQlib is in active and continuing development. Our plan is in the roadmap, which is managed as a [github project](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/projects/1).\n\n\n\n# Offline Mode and Online Mode\nThe data server of Qlib can either deployed as `Offline` mode or `Online` mode. The default mode is offline mode.\n\nUnder `Offline` mode, the data will be deployed locally. \n\nUnder `Online` mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment-in-azure). The source code of online data server can be found in [Qlib-Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server).\n\n## Performance of Qlib Data Server\nThe performance of data processing is important to data-driven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib data server, we\ncompare it with several other data storage solutions. \n\nWe evaluate the performance of several storage solutions by finishing the same task,\nwhich creates a dataset (14 features/factors) from the basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market (800 stocks each day from 2007 to 2020). The task involves data queries and processing.\n\n|                         | HDF5      | MySQL     | MongoDB   | InfluxDB  | Qlib -E -D  | Qlib +E -D   | Qlib +E +D  |\n| --                      | ------    | ------    | --------  | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n| Total (1CPU) (seconds)  | 184.4±3.7 | 365.3±7.5 | 253.6±6.7 | 368.2±3.6 | 147.0±8.8   | 47.6±1.0     | **7.4±0.3** |\n| Total (64CPU) (seconds) |           |           |           |           | 8.8±0.6     | **4.2±0.2**  |             |\n* `+(-)E` indicates with (out) `ExpressionCache`\n* `+(-)D` indicates with (out) `DatasetCache`\n\nMost general-purpose databases take too much time to load data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general-purpose database solutions.\nSuch overheads greatly slow down the data loading process.\nQlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.\n\n# Related Reports\n- [Guide To Qlib: Microsoft’s AI Investment Platform](https://analyticsindiamag.com/qlib/)\n- [微软也搞AI量化平台？还是开源的！](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/47bP5YwxfTp2uTHjUBzJQQ)\n- [微矿Qlib：业内首个AI量化投资开源平台](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vsJv7lsgjEi-ALYUz4CvtQ)\n\n# Contact Us\n- If you have any issues, please create issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/issues/new/choose) or send messages in [gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib).\n- If you want to make contributions to `Qlib`, please [create pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/compare). \n- For other reasons, you are welcome to contact us by email([qlib@microsoft.com](mailto:qlib@microsoft.com)).\n  - We are recruiting new members(both FTEs and interns), your resumes are welcome!\n\nJoin IM discussion groups:\n|[Gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib)|\n|----|\n|![image](http://fintech.msra.cn/images_v070/qrcode/gitter_qr.png)|\n\n# Contributing\nWe appreciate all contributions and thank all the contributors!\n<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=microsoft/qlib\" /></a>\n\nBefore we released Qlib as an open-source project on Github in Sep 2020, Qlib is an internal project in our group.
