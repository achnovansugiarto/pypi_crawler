    "description": "PyTranscode Readme\n==================\n\nCopyright (C) 2009  Martin P. Buhr (http://lonelycode.com / twitter: @lonelycode)\n\nPyTranscode is a set of scripts to make handling ffmpeg easier in python,\nit enables video information extraction, transcoding, presets, splash image\nextraction (multiple) and state reporting (percentage complete)\n\nContents:\n=========\n\n1. What is this?\n2. Hopeful Roadmap\n3. How to use the scripts\n4. License\n\n\n1. What is this?\n================\n\nA while back I wrote a proof-of-concept webapp that basically replicated what\nBrightcove and other online video management tools did, and at its heart was a\ntool to control FFMPEG - one of the best command-line transcoders out there.\n\nNow the webapp never took off (it was never launched, pending a rewrite), but\nI had started on rewriting the engine that would control the transcoder software.\n\nI've since moved my limited attention span to other, shineir things, but thought\nI would release this piece of rather nifty and handy code to the public to help\nothers who want to do something with video and don;t want to fork out a fortune.\n\n2. Hopeful Roadmap\n==================\n\nPyTranscode is hopefully going to be part of something bigger - the vision is to\nproduce a set of django applications which can do the following:\n\n- A storage engine for local or cloud-based storage\n- A queue manager for scaling, this again would have vairous back-ends for local\n  queue management or something like Amazon Queue Service\n- A transcode server that can be run on multpile machines and be managed via an\n  API OR be run in a mode to interact with the queue service\n- An API wrapper to control the transcode-server for common tasks\n\n3. How to use the scripts\n=========================\n\nThere are five files with PyTranscode, these have the following basic functionsality:\n\n- ffmpeg.py:    Can be used to build a command line to run ffmpeg for various\n                settings with input/output\n\n- presets.py:   Some presets to use with ffmpeg if you can;t be bothered to\n                write out the long dictionaries some transcodes require\n\n- runner.py:    Runner basically allows you to run ffmpeg in a managed way and\n                trap the output as well as the percentage complete\n\n- splash.py:    This will let you pull thumbnails at equal intervals from the\n                inpout file and return the filenames\n\n- video_info:   Need to know everything about a video file? This basically parses\n                the -i output from ffmpeg to get all the details and present\n                them as a class\n\nDepending on what you need, the documentation on how to use each one is in the\nheader of the file.\n\nIf you want to see a test run, there's the file test.py which should show an easy\nway to get started with these classes.\n\n4.
