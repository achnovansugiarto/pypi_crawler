To share the data with PyTorch, the intermediate results are\ntypically saved back as tables on HDFS. This can bring some headaches to developers.\n\n1. For the same task, users are forced to program for multiple systems (SQL & Python).\n\n2. Data could be polymorphic. Non-relational data, such as tensors, dataframes and graphs/networks (in `GraphScope`_) are\n   becoming increasingly prevalent. Tables and SQL may not be best way to store/exchange or process them.\n   Having the data transformed from/to \"tables\" back and forth between different systems could be a huge\n   overhead.\n\n3. Saving/loading the data to/from the external storage\n   requires lots of memory-copies and IO costs.\n\nVineyard is designed to solve these issues by providing:\n\n1. **In-memory** distributed data sharing in a **zero-copy** fashion to avoid\n   introducing extra I/O costs by exploiting a shared memory manager derived from plasma.\n\n2. Built-in **out-of-the-box high-level** abstraction to share the distributed\n   data with complex structures (e.g., distributed graphs)\n   with nearly zero extra development cost, while the transformation costs are eliminated.\n\nAs shown in the right side of the above figure, we illustrate how to integrate\nvineyard to solve the task in the big data context.\n\nFirst, we use `Mars`_ (a tensor-based unified framework for large-scale data\ncomputation which scales Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn) to preprocess the raw data\njust like the single machine solution do, and save the preprocessed dataframe into vineyard.\n\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|             | .. code-block:: python                                                      |\n| single      |                                                                             |\n|             |     data_csv = pd.read_csv('./data.csv', usecols=[1])                       |\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|             | .. code-block:: python                                                      |\n|             |                                                                             |\n|             |     import mars.dataframe as md                                             |\n| distributed |     dataset = md.read_csv('hdfs://server/data_full', usecols=[1])           |\n|             |     # after preprocessing, save the dataset to vineyard                     |\n|             |     vineyard_distributed_tensor_id = dataset.to_vineyard()                  |\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThen, we modify the\ntraining phase to get the preprocessed data from vineyard. Here vineyard makes\nthe sharing of distributed data between `Mars`_ and PyTorch just like a local\nvariable in the single machine solution.\n\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|             | .. code-block:: python                                                      |\n| single      |                                                                             |\n|             |     data_X, data_Y = create_dataset(dataset)                                |\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|             | .. code-block:: python                                                      |\n|             |                                                                             |\n|             |     client = vineyard.connect(vineyard_ipc_socket)                          |\n| distributed |     dataset = client.get(vineyard_distributed_tensor_id).local_partition()  |\n|             |     data_X, data_Y = create_dataset(dataset)                                |\n+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nFinally, we run the training phase distributedly across the cluster.\n\nFrom the example, we see that with vineyard, the task in the big data context\ncan be handled with only minor modifications to the single machine solution. Compare\nwith the existing approaches, the\nI/O and transformation overheads are also eliminated.\n\nFeatures\n---------\n\nIn-memory immutable data sharing\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nVineyard is an in-memory immutable data manager, sharing immutable data across\ndifferent systems via shared memory without extra overheads. Vineyard eliminates\nthe overhead of serialization/deserialization and IO during exchanging immutable\ndata between systems.\n\nOut-of-the-box high level data abstraction\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nComputation frameworks usually have their own data abstractions for high-level concepts,\nfor example tensor could be `torch.tensor`, `tf.Tensor`, `mxnet.ndarray` etc., not to\nmention that every `graph processing engine <https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope>`_\nhas its own graph structure representations.\n\nThe variety of data abstractions makes the sharing hard. Vineyard provides out-of-the-box\nhigh-level data abstractions over in-memory blobs, by describing objects using hierarchical\nmetadatas. Various computation systems can utilize the built-in high level data abstractions\nto exchange data with other systems in computation pipeline in a concise manner.\n\nStream pipelining\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA computation doesn't need to wait all precedent's result arrive before starting to work.\nVineyard provides stream as a special kind of immutable data for such pipelining scenarios.\nThe precedent job can write the immutable data chunk by chunk to vineyard, while maintaining\nthe data structure semantic, and the successor job reads shared-memory chunks from vineyard's\nstream without extra copy cost, then triggers it's own work. The overlapping helps for\nreducing the overall processing time and memory consumption.\n\nDrivers\n^^^^^^^\n\nMany big data analytical tasks have lots of boilerplate routines for tasks that\nunrelated to the computation itself, e.g., various IO adaptors, data partition\nstrategies and migration jobs. As the data structure abstraction usually differs\nbetween systems such routines cannot be easily reused.\n\nVineyard provides such common manipulate routines on immutable data as drivers.\nBesides sharing the high level data abstractions, vineyard extends the capability\nof data structures by drivers, enabling out-of-the-box reusable routines for the\nboilerplate part in computation jobs.\n\nTry vineyard\n------------\n\nVineyard is distributed as a `python package`_ and can be easily installed with ``pip``:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   pip3 install vineyard\n\nThe latest version of online documentation can be found at https://v6d.io.\n\nIf you want to build vineyard from source, please refer to `Installation`_, and refer to\n`Contributing`_ for how to build and run unittests locally.\n\nOnce installed, you can start a vineyard instance with:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   python3 -m vineyard\n\nFor more details about connecting to a locally deployed vineyard instance, please refer to\n`Getting Started`_.\n\nIntegrate with Kubernetes\n-------------------------\n\nVineyard helps share immutable data between different workloads, is a natural fit\nto cloud-native computing. Vineyard could provide efficient distributed data sharing\nin cloud-native environment by embracing cloud-native big data processing and Kubernetes\nhelps vineyard leverage the scale-in/out and scheduling ability of Kubernetes.\n\nDeployment on Kubernetes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFor better leveraging the scale-in/out capability of Kubernetes for worker pods of\na data analytical job, vineyard could be deployed on Kubernetes to as a DaemonSet\nin Kubernetes cluster. Vineyard pods shares memory with worker pods using a UNIX\ndomain socket with fine-grained access control.\n\nThe UNIX domain socket can be either mounted on ``hostPath`` or via a ``PersistentVolumeClaim``.\nWhen users bundle vineyard and the workload to the same pod, the UNIX domain socket\ncould also be shared using an ``emptyDir``.\n\n**Note** that when deploying vineyard on Kubernetes, it usually can only be connected\nfrom containers in the same pod, or pods on the same hosts.\n\nDeployment with Helm\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nVineyard also has tight integration with Kubernetes and Helm. Vineyard can be deployed\nwith ``helm``:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n   helm repo add vineyard https://vineyard.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/charts/\n   helm install vineyard vineyard/vineyard\n\nIn the further vineyard will improve the integration with Kubernetes by abstract\nvineyard objects as as Kubernetes resources (i.e., CRDs), and leverage a vineyard\noperator to operate vineyard cluster.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\nVineyard shares many similarities with other opensource projects, but still differs\na lot with them. We are frequently asked with the following questions about vineyard,\n\n* Q: Can clients look at the data while the stream is being filled?\n\n  One piece of data for multiple clients is one of the target scenarios as the\n  data live in vineyard is *immutable*, and multiple clients can safely consume\n  the same piece of data by memory sharing, without the extra cost and extra memory\n  usage of copying data back and forth.\n\n* Q: How vineyard avoids serialization/deserialization between systems in different languages?\n\n  Vineyard provides higher-level data abstractions (e.g., ndarrays, dataframes) that\n  could be shared in a natural way between different processes.\n\n* . . . . . .\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to our `FAQ`_ page.\n\nGetting involved\n----------------\n\n- Join in the `CNCF Slack`_ and navigate to the ``#vineyard`` channel for discussion.\n- Read `contribution guide`_.\n- Please report bugs by submitting a `GitHub issue`_ or ask me anything in `Github discussion`_.\n- Submit contributions using pull requests.\n\nThank you in advance for your contributions to vineyard!\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe thank the following excellent open-source projects:\n\n- `apache-arrow <https://github.com/apache/arrow>`_, a cross-language development platform for in-memory analytics;\n- `boost-leaf <https://github.com/boostorg/leaf>`_, a C++ lightweight error augmentation framework;\n- `ctti <https://github.com/Manu343726/ctti>`_, a C++ compile-time type information library;\n- `dlmalloc <http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.htmlp>`_, Doug Lea's memory allocator;\n- `etcd-cpp-apiv3 <https://github.com/etcd-cpp-apiv3/etcd-cpp-apiv3>`_, a C++ API for etcd's v3 client API;\n- `flat_hash_map <https://github.com/skarupke/flat_hash_map>`_, an efficient hashmap implementation;\n- `wyhash <https://github.com/alainesp/wy>`_, C++ wrapper around wyhash and wyrand;\n- `jemalloc <https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc>`_ a general purpose ``malloc(3)`` implementation.\n- `nlohmann/json <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>`_, a json library for modern c++.\n- `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_, a library for seamless operability between C++11 and Python;\n- `s3fs <https://github.com/dask/s3fs>`_, a library provide a convenient Python filesystem interface for S3.\n- `tbb <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB>`_ a C++ library for threading building blocks.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n**Vineyard** is distributed under `Apache License 2.0`_.
