    "description": "IPS-Vagrant\n===========\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nipsv is a Vagrant box utility designed specifically for `Invision Power\nSuite <https://www.invisionpower.com>`__ third party developers. It aims\nto make developing IPS applications and plugins a more enjoyable\nexperience by eliminating the headache of having to manage and manually\nconfigure a local development environment using WAMP or similar means.\n\nWhenever you normally want to make a new test install of IPS, you have\nto..\n\n-  Download the most recent IPS release\n-  Extract the setup files to a new web directory\n-  Apply proper permissions to those files and folders\n-  Update the configuration files for your web server\n-  Create a new MySQL database\n-  Go through the process of running the web installer and filling in\n   all your server information again\n-  Download the most recent developer tools from the marketplace\n-  Extract those developer tools to your IPS installation\n-  Create a new constants.php file to finally put the installation into\n   IN\\_DEV mode.\n\nThat's quite a headache to go through *every time* you want to create a\nnew IPS test installation.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if you could automate doing all of the above in a\nsingle command? Meet IPS Vagrant.\n\nWhat is Vagrant?\n----------------\n\n`Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`__ is software for managing\nvirtual development environments. It allows you to easily create and\ndestroy virtual machines on the fly.\n\nWhat is IPS-Vagrant?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIPS-Vagrant is a custom server and configuration file management\napplication that comes pre-installed on the\n`FujiMakoto/ipsv <https://atlas.hashicorp.com/FujiMakoto/boxes/ipsv>`__\nVagrant box.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nTo get started working with IPS-Vagrant, you will need to set up a new\nVagrant box.\n\nIf you haven't already, install\n`Vagrant <https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/>`__ and\n`VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__ now.\n\n| Next, download the latest release of IPS-Vagrant and extract the\n  contents to a dedicated Vagrant folder,\n| https://github.com/FujiMakoto/IPS-Vagrant/releases\n\nThis is the directory where all of your HTTP files and projects will be\nsaved by default.\n\nAfter the files have been extracted, open up your terminal (or\nPowerShell if you're on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you\nextracted the Vagrant files, then run the command **vagrant up**.\n\nThis will automatically download and import the custom Vagrant box and\nrun all necessary setup tasks for you.\n\nOnce the Vagrant box has been downloaded and set up, you'll be able to\nimmediately connect to the box by running the **vagrant ssh** command if\nyou're on Linux/OSX.\n\nIf you're on Windows, you'll need to use a dedicated SSH client such as\n`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`__.\n(You connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 2222 with \"vagrant\" as the\nusername/password combination by default).\n\nRunning Commands\n----------------\n\nAll IPS-Vagrant administrative commands can be accessed using the\n**ipsv** commandline application. Running the command without any\narguments will bring up the help page,\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n      IPS Vagrant Management Utility\n\n    Options:\n      -v, --verbose      -v|vv|vvv Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal\n                         output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\n      -c, --config PATH  Path to the IPSV configuration file\n      --version          Show the version and exit.\n      --help             Show this message and exit.\n\n    Commands:\n      disable   Disable installations under a domain.\n      enable    Enable an IPS installation.\n      list      List all domains, or all installations under a specified domain.\n      new       Creates a new IPS installation.\n      setup     Run setup after a fresh Vagrant installation.\n      versions  Displays available IPS and resource versions.\n\nSetting up a new installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe **new** command is used to create installations.\n\nTo get an overview of how the command works, run **ipsv new --help**\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv new [OPTIONS]\n\n      Downloads and installs a new instance of the latest Invision Power Suite\n      release.\n\n    Options:\n      -n, --name TEXT           Installation name.\n      -d, --domain TEXT         Installation domain name.\n      -l, --license TEXT        License key to use for requests.\n      -v, --version TEXT        Manually specify a version to install.\n      -f, --force               Overwrite any existing files (possibly left over\n                                from a broken configuration)\n      --enable / --disable      Enable site after installation. Note that this will\n                                automatically disable any existing sites running on\n                                this domain.

Only\n                                applies when SSL is enabled. (Default: False)\n      --gzip / --no-gzip        Enable GZIP compression. (Default: True)\n      --cache / --no-cache      Use cached version downloads if possible. (Default:\n                                True)\n      --install / --no-install  Run the IPS installation automatically after setup.\n                                (Default: True)\n      --dev / --no-dev          Install developer tools and put the site into dev\n                                mode after installation. (Default: False)\n      --help                    Show this message and exit.\n\nTo start the installation process, run **ipsv new** without any\narguments.\n\nThen, just follow the on-screen prompts to go through the installation\nstages.\n\n::\n\n    Installation nickname: First Installation\n    Domain name: ipb.dev\n    Do you want to enable this site after installation?

This is the username/password you use to access your\nInvisionPower.com account.\n\nAfter that, you will be prompted for the license you would like to use\nfor the installation.\n\nOnce all of the setup files have been extracted and the database has\nbeen set up, you will be prompted for your desired admin credentials.\n\nWith just these few basic pieces of information, you'll have a working\nIPS installation set up and ready for you in under a minute!\n\nListing installations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe **list** command is used to get an overview of all active domains\nand installations.\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv list [OPTIONS] <domain> <site>\n\n      List all domains if no <domain> is provided. If <domain> is provided but\n      <site> is not, lists all sites hosted under <domain>. If both <domain> and\n      <site> are provided, lists information on the specified site.\n\n    Options:\n      --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nWhen no arguments are provided, the command will provide an overview of\nall known installation domains,\n\n::\n\n    ipb.dev (www.ipb.dev)\n\nWhen a domain is provided, the command will output all installations\navailable under that domain,\n\n::\n\n    First Installation (4.0.13.1)\n    [DEV] Second Installation (4.0.13.1)\n\nThe currently active installation will be highlighted green (if your\nterminal supports colors).\n\nWhen both a domain and an installation name are provided, the command\nwill provide information on the specified installation,\n\n::\n\n    Name: Second Installation\n    Domain: ipb.dev\n    Version: 4.0.13.1\n    License Key: 1111111111-22222-333333-4444444444\n    Status: Enabled\n    IN_DEV: Enabled\n    SSL: Disabled\n    SPDY: Disabled\n    GZIP: Enabled\n\nListing available versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe **versions** command is used to display cached IPS versions\navailable for installation using the **--version** flag with the **new**\ncommand.\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv versions [OPTIONS] <resource>\n\n      Displays all locally cached <resource> versions available for installation.\n\n      Available resources:\n          ips (default)\n          dev_tools\n\n    Options:\n      --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nWhen no arguments are provided, the command will display available ips\nversions by default,\n\n::\n\n    4.0.0 Beta 8\n    4.0.0 RC6\n    4.0.9.2\n    4.0.11\n    4.0.12.1\n    4.0.13.1\n\nIPS installations are stored in the **versions/ips** folder in your\nVagrant path.\n\nTo add a new version for installation, just copy the IPS installation\n.zip archive into this directory. You don't need to do anything to make\nit recognizable to ipsv, it should work with any non-beta installation\npackage as is, regardless of the filename.\n\nTo install a custom IPS version, just use the --version flag with the\nnew command.\n\nFor example, **ipsv new --version=\"4.0.11\"**\n\nDeveloper Tool resources are stored in the **versions/dev\\_tools**\ndirectory in your Vagrant path. Unlike with IPS versions, these are\nselected automatically based on the IPS version you install.\n\nThe installation script will try and use the matching Developer Tools\nversion if it's available. If not, it will elicit a warning during\ninstallation and will use the closest available version instead.\n\nPlease note that the script can ***not*** currently automatically\ndownload the Developer Tools resource, as IPS' community website\ncurrently blocks unrecognized web crawlers and scrapers (including\nipsv).\n\nBecause of this, in order to automatically install and enable IN\\_DEV\nmode with your installation, you will have to manually download the\nlatest Developer Tools resource and copy it to the dev\\_tools path\nspecified above. You will also need to pass the **--dev** flag with the\nipsv new command.\n\nEnabling installations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen working with multiple installations under the same domain name, you\nwill want to be able to easily cycle between them. This is where the\nenable command comes in handy.\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv enable [OPTIONS] <domain> <site>\n\n      Enable the <site> under the specified <domain>\n\n    Options:\n      --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nTo enable an installation, just run the **ipsv enable** command with the\nrelevant domain and site names.\n\nThe list command can be used in conjunction with this to obtain the\nrequired informaiton.\n\nDisabling installations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you no longer wish to use a specific domain, you can use the disable\ncommand to deactive it completely.\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv disable [OPTIONS] <domain>\n\n      Disable installations under the specified <domain>\n\n    Options:\n      --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nDeleting installations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo completely remove a site or domain from ipsv's database, you can use\nthe delete command.\n\n::\n\n    Usage: ipsv delete [OPTIONS] <domain> <site>\n\n      Deletes a single site if both <domain> and <site> are specified, or ALL sites\n      under a domain if only the <domain> is specified.\n\n    Options:\n      --remove-code / --preserve-code\n                                      Deletes project code (HTTP files) with the site\n                                      entry. (Default: Preserve)\n      --no-safety-prompt              Skip the safety confirmation prompt(s). USE\n                                      WITH CAUTION!\n      --help                          Show this message and exit.\n\nWhen both a domain and site name are provided, the command will delete a\nsingle installation.\n\nWhen only a domain is provided, the command will delete all\ninstallations under the specified domain.\n\nBy default, the delete command will retain project code files. When the\n**--remove-code** option is provided, the script will delete all HTTP\nfiles with the site entry. You will be required to re-input the\nsite/domain name when utilizing this option as an additional safety\nmeasure.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n    The MIT License (MIT)\n\n    Copyright (c) 2015 Makoto Fujimoto\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
