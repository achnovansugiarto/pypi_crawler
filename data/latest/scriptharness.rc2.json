    "description": "Scriptharness\n*************\n\nScriptharness is a framework for writing scripts.  There are three\ncore principles: full logging, flexible configuration, and modular\nactions.  The goal of *full logging* is to be able to debug problems\npurely through the log.  The goal of *flexible configuration* is to\nmake each script useful in a variety of contexts and environments.\nThe goals of *modular actions* are a) faster development feedback\nloops and b) different workflows for different usage requirements.\n\n\nFull logging\n============\n\nMany scripts log.  However, logging can happen sporadically, and it's\ngenerally acceptable to run a number of actions silently (e.g.,\n\"os.chdir()\" will happily change directories with no indication in the\nlog).  In *full logging*, the goal is to be able to debug bustage\npurely through the log.\n\nAt the outset, the user can add a generic logging wrapper to any\nmethod with minimal fuss.  As scriptharness matures, there will be\nmore customized wrappers to use as drop-in replacements for\npreviously-non-logging methods.\n\n\nFlexible configuration\n======================\n\nMany scripts use some sort of configuration, whether hardcoded, in a\nfile, or through the command line.  A family of scripts written by the\nsame author(s) may have similar configuration options and patterns,\nbut often times they vary wildly from script to script.\n\nBy offering a standard way of accepting configuration options, and\nthen exporting that config to a file for later debugging or\nreplication, scriptharness makes things a bit neater and cleaner and\nmore familiar between scripts.\n\nBy either disallowing runtime configuration changes, or by explicitly\nlogging them, scriptharness removes some of the guesswork when\ndebugging bustage.\n\n\nModular actions\n===============\n\nScriptharness actions allow for:\n\n* faster development feedback loops.  No need to rerun the entirety\n  of a long-running script when trying to debug a single action inside\n  that script.\n\n* different workflows for different usage requirements, such as\n  running standalone versus running in cloud infrastructure\n\nThis is in the same spirit of other frameworks that allow for discrete\ntargets, tasks, or actions: make, maven, ansible, and many more.\n\n\nRunning unit tests\n==================\n\n\nLinux and OS X\n--------------\n\n   # By default, this will look for python 2.7 + 3.{3,4,5}.\n   # You can run |tox -e ENV| to run a specific env, e.g. |tox -e py27|\n   pip install tox\n   tox\n   # alternately, ./run_tests.sh\n\n\nWindows\n-------\n\n   # By default, this will look for python 2.7 + 3.4\n   # You can run |tox -c tox_win.ini -e ENV| to run a specific env, e.g. |tox -c tox_win.ini -e py27|\n   pip install tox\n   tox -c win.ini",
