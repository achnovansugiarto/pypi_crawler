It helps you track work progress and notify your team about situations\nthat may require their attention. It is available\n[in the cloud](https://teamplify.com) or as an on-premise installation.\n\nThis package is the installer and runner for the on-premise version.\n\n* [System requirements](#system-requirements)\n   * [On Ubuntu, be sure to install pip3](#on-ubuntu-be-sure-to-install-pip3)\n   * [Hardware](#hardware)\n* [Installing](#installing)\n   * [Installing on Linux](#installing-on-linux)\n   * [Installing on Mac OS X](#installing-on-mac-os-x)\n* [Configuration](#configuration)\n   * [Where are configuration files located?](#where-are-configuration-files-located)\n   * [A reference of all configuration options](#a-reference-of-all-configuration-options)\n* [Starting and stopping the service](#starting-and-stopping-the-service)\n* [What to do after the first run?](#what-to-do-after-the-first-run)\n   * [Creating an admin account](#creating-an-admin-account)\n* [Updating Teamplify](#updating-teamplify)\n* [Backup and restore](#backup-and-restore)\n* [A Sample maintenance script](#a-sample-maintenance-script)\n* [Uninstall](#uninstall)\n* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n   * [Teamplify won't start](#teamplify-wont-start)\n   * [Email delivery issues](#email-delivery-issues)\n   * [The connection is refused or not trusted in SSL-enabled mode](#the-connection-is-refused-or-not-trusted-in-ssl-enabled-mode)\n   * [Other](#other)\n* [License](#license)\n\n\n## System requirements\n\nTeamplify is designed to run on Linux. For demonstration purposes, it should\nalso deploy on Mac OS X. Windows is not supported.\n\nBefore you install, make sure that your system has the following components:\n\n* [Docker version 1.13 and above](https://docs.docker.com/install/);\n* [Python 3.6 and above](https://www.python.org/downloads/);\n* [pip for Python 3](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line)\n\nTo check that the required versions are installed, run these commands (shown\nwith example output):\n\n``` shell\n$ docker -v\nDocker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a215d7133c34aa18e3b72b4a21fd0c6136\n$ python3 --version\nPython 3.7.2\n$ pip3 --version\npip 9.0.3 from /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages (python 3.7)\n```\n\n### On Ubuntu, be sure to install `pip3`\n\nOn most systems, `Python 3` comes with `pip3`  pre-installed. However,\nin Ubuntu `Python 3` and `pip3` are installed separately. To install\n`pip3` run:\n\n```shell\n$ sudo apt install python3-pip\n```\n\n**Important**: after installing, exit the terminal and re-open it.\nThis forces the terminal to update its path configuration, so that you\ncan find the command line tools installed with `pip3` in your `$PATH`.\n\n### Hardware\n\nAs a default server configuration, we recommend 4GB of RAM, 2 CPU cores, and\n30 GB of disk space (SSD is strongly recommended). For most small-to-medium\norganizations (up to a few dozen people), this should be enough. Larger\nworkloads, however, may need more resources. The recommended strategy is to\nstart with the default server configuration and scale up or down depending on\nthe workload.\n\n## Installing\n\n### Installing on Linux\n\nAfter installing Docker, check Docker's\n[post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).\nYou probably want to make sure that you can run Docker commands without\n`sudo`, and that Docker is configured to start on boot.\n\nInstall the latest version of Teamplify runner with pip:\n\n``` shell\n$ pip3 install -U teamplify\n```\n\n### Installing on Mac OS X\n\nOn Mac OS X, we recommend installing Teamplify in a Python virtual\nenvironment located in your home directory. This is because Teamplify needs to\nmount its configuration files into Docker containers. By default on Mac OS X,\nonly the `/Users` folder is shared with Docker.\n\n1. Create a new Python virtual environment for Teamplify in your home directory:\n``` shell\n$ python3 -m venv ~/.venv/teamplify\n```\n\n2. Activate it:\n``` shell\n$ source ~/.venv/teamplify/bin/activate\n```\n\n3. At this point, a `pip` command is linked to the virtual environment that\nyou just created. Install Teamplify runner with `pip`:\n``` shell\n$ pip install teamplify\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nTeamplify requires a configuration file to run.\n\n1. Run the following command to create the initial file:\n``` shell\n$ teamplify configure\n```\n  _This creates a configuration file with default settings in your home\ndirectory: `~/.teamplify.ini`. You can specify the location of\nyour file with the `--config` option._\n\n2. Use your text editor to  adjust the contents of this file.\n  You need to specify the following parameters:\n  * `product_key` in the  `[main]` section\n  * `host` and `port` in the `[web]` section\n  \n  Other parameters are optional and can keep their default values.\n  You can review them at [the reference of all configuration options](#A-reference-of-all-configuration-options)\n\n### Where are configuration files located?\n\nWhen you run `teamplify configure`, it creates a configuration file.\nTypically, this file is at `~/.teamplify.ini`.\n\nHowever, that is not the only\npossible location. Teamplify searches the following locations (listed from\nhighest priority to lowest priority):\n\n1. First, it checks the location specified in the `--config` parameter in the\ncommand line. Example:\n\n   ``` shell\n   $ teamplify --config /path/to/configuration/file start\n   ```\n\n2. An environment variable named `TEAMPLIFY_CONF`. Example:\n\n   ``` shell\n   $ TEAMPLIFY_CONF=/path/to/configuration/file teamplify start\n   ```\n\n3. In the home directory of the current user: `~/.teamplify.ini`;\n4. At `/etc/teamplify/teamplify.ini`.\n\n\n### A reference of all configuration options\n\n`[main]`\n\n- `product_key` - the product key of your installation. This is required.\n  To get the product key, please email us at\n  [support@teamplify.com](mailto:support@teamplify.com);\n\n- `update_channel` - the application distribution channel to use. The recommended setting is `stable`.\n  With the `stable` channel, you should expect a few updates per month.\n  Please note that Teamplify doesn't update itself\n  automatically unless you've explicitly configured it to do so. See the\n  [Updates](#updates) and [Maintenance script](#maintenance-script) sections\n  below;\n\n- `send_crash_reports` - possible values are `yes` and `no`, defaults to `yes`.\n  When set to `yes`, the system automatically sends application crash\n  reports to our team. We recommend keeping this option enabled as it helps us\n  to detect bugs faster and ship fixes for them more quickly;\n\n`[web]`\n\n- `host` - domain name on which the Teamplify web interface will be running. It\n  must be created in advance, and pointed to the server where you have\n  installed Teamplify;\n- `port` - the port on which Teamplify web interface will be running, the default\n  is `80`. If `use_ssl` is set to `builtin` and no SSL certificates path is specified\n  then `80` is the only allowed option;\n- `use_ssl` - SSL mode. Possible values are `no`, `builtin`, and `external`, defaults to\n  `no`. When set to `builtin`, Teamplify will serve HTTPS requests on the port specified \n  in the `ssl_port` option below. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to this port.\n  If you're hosting Teamplify behind a proxy or load balancer that is already \n  configured for SSL support, please set this parameter to `external`, \n  and also make sure that your proxy correctly sets `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP header.\n  In this case, Teamplify will handle HTTP requests on the port number specified \n  in the `port` option and redirect insecure requests to `https://<host>:<ssl_port>`.\n- `ssl_port` - the port on which Teamplify web interface will be running when SSL\n  is enabled, the default is `443`. If `use_ssl` is set to `builtin` and \n  no SSL certificates path is specified, then `443` is the only allowed option;\n- `ssl_certs` (optional) - a path to a directory which contains SSL\n  certificates. The directory must contain certificate (.crt) and key (.key) files \n  for the domain specified in the `host` option above. The filenames must be equal \n  the domain name. For example, if the domain is `example.com`, the filenames \n  must be `example.com.crt` and `example.com.key`. If no path is specified,\n  Teamplify runner will use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) \n  to generate and renew SSL certificates for the domain that you specified\n  in the `host` parameter above.\n\n`[runner]`\n\n`[db]`\n\n- `host` - defaults to `builtin_db`, that is, using the DB instance that is\n  shipped with Teamplify. You can also switch to an external MySQL 5.7\n  compatible database by providing its hostname instead of `builtin_db` and\n  specifying other DB connection parameters below;\n- `name` - the database name to use. Must be `teamplify` if `builtin_db` is\n  used;\n- `port` - the database port. Must be `3306` for `builtin_db`;\n- `user` - DB user. Must be `root` for `builtin_db`;\n- `password` - DB password. Must be `teamplify` for `builtin_db`;\n- `backup_mount` - a path to a directory on the server which will be mounted\n  into the built-in DB instance container. It is used as a temporary directory\n  in the process of making and restoring backups;\n\n`[email]`\n\n- `address_from` - email address used by Teamplify in the FROM field of its\n  email messages. It could be either a plain email address or an email address\n  with a display name, like this:\n  `Teamplify <teamplify@your-company-domain.com>`;\n- `smtp_host` - hostname of an SMTP server used to send emails. Defaults to\n  `builtin_smtp` which means using the SMTP server that is shipped with\n  Teamplify. Built-in SMTP for Teamplify is based on Postfix, and it is\n  production-ready. However, if you plan to use it, we strongly recommend that\n  you add the address of Teamplify's server to the\n  [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax) of the domain used\n  in the `address_from` setting to prevent Teamplify emails from being marked\n  as spam. Or, you can configure Teamplify to use an external SMTP server by\n  providing its hostname instead of `builtin_smtp` and configuring other\n  SMTP connection settings below;\n- `smtp_protocol` - SMTP protocol to use. Can be `plain`, `ssl`, or `tls`.\n  Must be `plain` if you use `builtin_smtp`;\n- `smtp_port` - SMTP port to use. Must be `25` for `builtin_smtp`;\n- `smtp_user` - username for the SMTP server. Must be blank for `builtin_smtp`;\n- `smtp_password` - password for the SMTP server. Must be blank for\n  `builtin_smtp`;\n\n`[crypto]`\n\n- `signing_key` - the random secret string used by Teamplify for signing\n  cookies and generating CSRF protection tokens. It is automatically generated\n  when you run `teamplify configure`, and typically you don't need to change\n  it unless you think that it may be compromised. In such cases, replace it with\n  another 50-character random string made of Latin characters and numbers\n  (please note that this will force all existing users to log in to the system\n  again).\n\n`[worker]`\n\n- `slim_count` - number of workers doing background tasks, such as sending\n  notifications and emails. The default setting is `1`, which is sufficient\n  for most organizations.\n- `fat_count` - the number of workers synchronizing resources, such as\n  repositories, chats, issues, etc. If you have a lot of resources or it takes\n  a long time to sync them, you can increase this parameter. Essentially, it\n  controls how many resources are synchronized in parallel. The default setting\n  is `2`.\n\n## Starting and stopping the service\n\nAfter you have created the configuration file, start Teamplify with:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify start\n```\n\nOn the first run, the application has to download and configure many Docker\nimages. For this reason, the first run might take a while to start.\n\nAfter the command completes, open Teamplify in your browser using the `host` and\nthe `port` that you provided in the `[web]` section of the configuration. After\nstarting the service, it might take a minute or two before it finally comes\nonline.\n\nIf you have problems starting Teamplify, please see the\n[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.\n\nIf you need to stop Teamplify, run:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify stop\n```\n\nAfter running Teamplify for the first time,\n[follow the instructions to create an admin account](#create-an-admin-account)\n\nThere's also a convenient command to stop the service and start it again. This\nis useful when applying changes made to the configuration:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify restart\n```\n\n## What to do after the first run?\n\nAfter the first run, you need to create an admin account.\n\n### Creating an admin account\n\nAfter the application first starts, run the following command:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify createadmin --email <admin@email> --full-name <Full Name>\n```\n\nPlease check the output to make sure that no errors occurred.\n\nWith the `createadmin` command, you can create as many\nadmin account as you want. However, after creating the first one,\nit might be more convenient to create the others through the Teamplify UI.\n\n## Updating Teamplify\n\nTeamplify installation consists of the Teamplify runner and the Teamplify\nproduct itself, which ships in the form of Docker images. We recommend\nthat you use the most recent version to keep up with the latest features and\nbugfixes. The update process consists of two steps:\n\n1. Update Teamplify runner:\n\n   ``` shell\n   $ pip3 install -U teamplify\n   ```\n\n2. Update Teamplify itself:\n\n   ``` shell\n   $ teamplify update\n   ```\n\nThe `update` command automatically detects if a new version has been\ndownloaded and, if necessary, restarts the service. Because a service restart\ncauses  a short downtime, you should ideally update in periods of low user\nactivity. The `update` command restarts the service only when necessary. If no\nupdate has been downloaded, there is no restart and therefore no service\ninterruption.\n\n## Backup and restore\n\nTeamplify stores your data in a MySQL database. As with any other database, it\nmight be a good idea to make backups from time to time to time.\n\nTo back up the built-in Teamplify database, run:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify backup [optional-backup-file-or-directory]\n```\n\nIf launched without parameters, it makes a gzipped backup of the DB and\nstores it in the current working directory, under a name in the format:\n\n* `teamplify_<current-date>.sql.gz`,\n  * for example, `teamplify_2019-01-31_06-58-57.sql.gz`.\n\nYou may specify the directory or file path where you'd like to save your backup.\n\nTo restore the built-in Teamplify database from a gzipped backup, run:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify restore <path-to-a-backup-file>\n```\n\nPlease note that the commands above work with only a built-in database.\nIf you're running Teamplify with an external database, you need to use tools\nfor backups or restores that connect to that database directly.\n\n## A Sample maintenance script\n\nBacking up the data and keeping the software up-to-date are routine operations.\nWe recommend automating these processes. Below is a sample script you can use to\ndo so.\n\n1. Create a file named `teamplify-maintenance.sh` with the following contents:\n\n``` shell\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# Backups directory:\nBACKUP_LOCATION=/backups/teamplify/\n\n# How many days should we store the backups for:\nBACKUP_STORE_DAYS=14\n\n# Back up Teamplify DB and update Teamplify:\nmkdir -p $BACKUP_LOCATION && \\\n    pip3 install -U teamplify && \\\n    teamplify backup $BACKUP_LOCATION && \\\n    teamplify update\n\n# If the update was successful, clean up old backups:\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n  find $BACKUP_LOCATION -type f -mmin +$((60 * 24 * $BACKUP_STORE_DAYS)) \\\n      -name 'teamplify_*.sql.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' \\;\nfi\n\n# The final step is optional but recommended. Add your code so that would\n# sync contents of $BACKUP_LOCATION to a physically remote location.\n#\n#   ... add your backups sync code below:\n```\n\nIn the code above, adjust the path for `$BACKUP_LOCATION` and the value\nfor `$BACKUP_STORE_DAYS` as necessary. At the end of the script, you can add\nyour own code that would sync your backups to a remote location. This is an\noptional but highly recommended precaution that would help you recover your\nbackup in the case of a disaster. For example, you can use\n[aws s3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) to\nupload the backups to AWS S3.\n\n2. When the maintenance script is ready, make it executable with\n`chmod +x teamplify-maintenance.sh`.\n\n3. Set the script to run as a daily cron job. Open the crontab schedule:\n\n``` shell\n$ crontab -e\n```\n\nAppend the following entry (remember to replace the path to the script):\n\n``` shell\n0 3 * * * /path/to/the/script/teamplify-maintenance.sh\n```\n\nIn the example above, the script is scheduled to run daily at 3 AM. See\n[cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for a detailed explanation.\nWhen ready, save and close the file.\n\n## Uninstall\n\nIf you'd like to uninstall Teamplify, use the following steps.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The uninstall procedure erases all data stored in Teamplify.\nBefore doing this, [consider making a backup](#backup-and-restore).\n\n1. Remove all Teamplify data, Docker images, volumes, and networks:\n\n``` shell\n$ teamplify erase\n```\n\n2. Uninstall Teamplify runner:\n\n``` shell\n$ pip3 uninstall teamplify\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSo what could possibly go wrong?\n\n### Teamplify won't start\n\nPlease check the following:\n\n- The service won't start if the configuration file is missing or contains\n  errors. In such cases, the `teamplify start` command will report a problem.\n  Please inspect its output;\n- There could be a problem with the domain name configuration. If the\n  `teamplify start` command has completed successfully, you should see\n  Teamplify's interface in the browser when you open an address specified in the\n  `host` and `port` parameters in the `[web]` section of the\n  [Configuration](#configuration). If that doesn't happen, i.e. if browser says\n  that it can't find the server or the server is not responding, then most\n  likely this is a problem with either the domain name or firewall\n  configuration. Please make sure that the domain exists and points to the\n  Teamplify server, and that the port is open in the firewall;\n- If you see the \"Teamplify is starting\" message, you should give it a minute\n  or two to come online. If nothing happens after a few minutes, there could be\n  a problem during application start. Application logs may contain additional\n  information:\n\n  ``` shell\n  $ docker logs teamplify_app\n  ```\n\n  Please let us know about the problem and attach the output from the command\n  above. You can either\n  [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/teamplify/teamplify-runner/issues),\n  or contact us at [support@teamplify.com](mailto:support@teamplify.com), or\n  use the live chat on [teamplify.com](https://teamplify.com).\n\n### Email delivery issues\n\nEmails can go to spam or sometimes aren't delivered at all. If you're\nrunning a demo version of Teamplify on your desktop at home, this is\nvery likely to happen, since IPs of home internet providers have a large\nchance of being blacklisted in spam databases. We recommend that you\ntry the following:\n\n- If you're going to use the built-in SMTP server, consider running Teamplify\n  on a server hosted in a data center or at your office, but not at home. Next,\n  please make sure that you've added the IP of your Teamplify server to the\n  [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax) of the domain used\n  in `address_from` setting in the configuration file;\n- Some email providers, for example, Google Mail, explicitly reject emails\n  sent from blacklisted IPs. It might be helpful to examine SMTP server\n  logs to see if that's what's happening:\n\n  ``` shell\n  $ docker logs teamplify_smtp\n  ```\n\n- Alternatively, if you have another SMTP server that is already configured\n  and can reliably send emails, you can configure Teamplify to use this server\n  instead of the built-in SMTP. See `[email]` section in\n  [Configuration](#configuration) for details;\n\n\n### The connection is refused or not trusted in SSL-enabled mode\n\nDuring the first start, Teamplify runner generates a temporary self-issued SSL\ncertificate (not trusted) and then tries to create a valid certificate for your\ndomain via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) that would replace the\ntemporary one. Besides that, it also creates a new set of 2048-bit DH parameters\nto give your SSL configuration an A+ rating. This process is rather slow and may\ntake a few minutes to complete. If you open Teamplify in your browser and see\nthat the SSL connection can't be established or is not trusted, the problem may\nbe caused by DH params or the SSL certificate generations that are still in\nprogress. After DH params and the SSL certificate have been successfully\ngenerated, they are saved for future use and subsequent restarts of the server\nshould be much faster.\n\nIf you have just started the server for the very first time, please give it a\nfew minutes to complete the initialization and then refresh the page in your\nbrowser. If after a few minutes the browser reports that the connection is not\ntrusted, it probably means that the certificate generation has failed. Please\ncheck the following:\n\n1. That the domain that you specified in the `host` parameter can be resolved\n   from the public Internet and is pointing to the server on which you have\n   installed Teamplify;\n2. That ports `80` and `443` are not blocked in the firewall.\n\nIt also might be helpful to check the logs:\n\n``` shell\n$ docker logs teamplify_letsencrypt\n```\n\n### Other\n\nFor any issue with Teamplify, we recommend that you try to\n[check for updates](#updates) first. We release updates frequently. It's quite\npossible that the problem that you encountered is already addressed in a newer\nversion.\n\nIf these suggested solutions don't work, don't hesitate to\n[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/teamplify/teamplify-runner/issues)\nor contact us at [support@teamplify.com](mailto:support@teamplify.com). You can\nalso use the live chat on [teamplify.com](https://teamplify.com). We're ready\nto help!\n\n## License\n\nTeamplify runner is available under the MIT license.
