It is very likely that the demo server will see traffic from clients other than yours.\n    # To avoid this, start your own locally and modify the example to use it.\n    nc = await nats.connect(\"nats://demo.nats.io:4222\")\n\n    # You can also use the following for TLS against the demo server.\n    #\n    # nc = await nats.connect(\"tls://demo.nats.io:4443\")\n\n    async def message_handler(msg):\n        subject = msg.subject\n        reply = msg.reply\n        data = msg.data.decode()\n        print(\"Received a message on '{subject} {reply}': {data}\".format(\n            subject=subject, reply=reply, data=data))\n\n    # Simple publisher and async subscriber via coroutine.\n    sub = await nc.subscribe(\"foo\", cb=message_handler)\n\n    # Stop receiving after 2 messages.\n    await sub.unsubscribe(limit=2)\n    await nc.publish(\"foo\", b'Hello')\n    await nc.publish(\"foo\", b'World')\n    await nc.publish(\"foo\", b'!!!!!')\n\n    # Synchronous style with iterator also supported.\n    sub = await nc.subscribe(\"bar\")\n    await nc.publish(\"bar\", b'First')\n    await nc.publish(\"bar\", b'Second')\n\n    try:\n        async for msg in sub.messages:\n            print(f\"Received a message on '{msg.subject} {msg.reply}': {msg.data.decode()}\")\n            await sub.unsubscribe()\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n\n    async def help_request(msg):\n        print(f\"Received a message on '{msg.subject} {msg.reply}': {msg.data.decode()}\")\n        await nc.publish(msg.reply, b'I can help')\n\n    # Use queue named 'workers' for distributing requests\n    # among subscribers.\n    sub = await nc.subscribe(\"help\", \"workers\", help_request)\n\n    # Send a request and expect a single response\n    # and trigger timeout if not faster than 500 ms.\n    try:\n        response = await nc.request(\"help\", b'help me', timeout=0.5)\n        print(\"Received response: {message}\".format(\n            message=response.data.decode()))\n    except TimeoutError:\n        print(\"Request timed out\")\n\n    # Remove interest in subscription.\n    await sub.unsubscribe()\n\n    # Terminate connection to NATS.\n    await nc.drain()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## JetStream\n\nStarting v2.0.0 series, the client now has JetStream support:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport nats\nfrom nats.errors import TimeoutError\n\nasync def main():\n    nc = await nats.connect(\"localhost\")\n\n    # Create JetStream context.\n    js = nc.jetstream()\n\n    # Persist messages on 'foo's subject.\n    await js.add_stream(name=\"sample-stream\", subjects=[\"foo\"])\n\n    for i in range(0, 10):\n        ack = await js.publish(\"foo\", f\"hello world: {i}\".encode())\n        print(ack)\n\n    # Create pull based consumer on 'foo'.\n    psub = await js.pull_subscribe(\"foo\", \"psub\")\n\n    # Fetch and ack messagess from consumer.\n    for i in range(0, 10):\n        msgs = await psub.fetch(1)\n        for msg in msgs:\n            print(msg)\n\n    # Create single ephemeral push based subscriber.\n    sub = await js.subscribe(\"foo\")\n    msg = await sub.next_msg()\n    await msg.ack()\n\n    # Create single push based subscriber that is durable across restarts.\n    sub = await js.subscribe(\"foo\", durable=\"myapp\")\n    msg = await sub.next_msg()\n    await msg.ack()\n\n    # Create deliver group that will be have load balanced messages.\n    async def qsub_a(msg):\n        print(\"QSUB A:\", msg)\n        await msg.ack()\n\n    async def qsub_b(msg):\n        print(\"QSUB B:\", msg)\n        await msg.ack()\n    await js.subscribe(\"foo\", \"workers\", cb=qsub_a)\n    await js.subscribe(\"foo\", \"workers\", cb=qsub_b)\n\n    for i in range(0, 10):\n        ack = await js.publish(\"foo\", f\"hello world: {i}\".encode())\n        print(\"\\t\", ack)\n\n    # Create ordered consumer with flow control and heartbeats\n    # that auto resumes on failures.\n    osub = await js.subscribe(\"foo\", ordered_consumer=True)\n    data = bytearray()\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            msg = await osub.next_msg()\n            data.extend(msg.data)\n        except TimeoutError:\n            break\n    print(\"All data in stream:\", len(data))\n\n    await nc.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## TLS\n\nTLS connections can be configured with an [ssl context](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#context-creation)\n\n```python\nssl_ctx = ssl.create_default_context(purpose=ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)\nssl_ctx.load_verify_locations('ca.pem')\nssl_ctx.load_cert_chain(certfile='client-cert.pem',\n                        keyfile='client-key.pem')\nawait nats.connect(servers=[\"tls://127.0.0.1:4443\"], tls=ssl_ctx, tls_hostname=\"localhost\")\n```\n\nSetting the scheme to `tls` in the connect URL will make the client create a [default ssl context](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.create_default_context) automatically:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport ssl\nfrom nats.aio.client import Client as NATS\n\nasync def run():\n    nc = NATS()\n    await nc.connect(\"tls://demo.nats.io:4443\")\n```\n\n*Note*: If getting SSL certificate errors in OS X, try first installing the `certifi` certificate bundle. If using Python 3.7 for example, then run:\n\n```ps\n$ /Applications/Python\\ 3.7/Install\\ Certificates.command\n -- pip install --upgrade certifi\nCollecting certifi\n...\n -- removing any existing file or link\n -- creating symlink to certifi certificate bundle\n -- setting permissions\n -- update complete\n```\n\n## NKEYS and JWT User Credentials\n\nSince [v0.9.0](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.py/releases/tag/v0.9.0) release,\nyou can also optionally install [NKEYS](https://github.com/nats-io/nkeys.py) in order to use\nthe new NATS v2.0 auth features:\n\n```sh\npip install nats-py[nkeys]\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```python\nawait nats.connect(\"tls://connect.ngs.global:4222\", user_credentials=\"/path/to/secret.creds\")\n```\n\n## Development\n\n1. [Install nats server](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation).\n1. Make sure the server is available in your PATH: `nats-server -v`.\n1. Install dependencies: `python3 -m pipenv install --dev`.\n1. Run tests: `python3 -m pytest`.\n\n## License\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the NATS source files are distributed under\nthe Apache Version 2.0 license found in the LICENSE file.\n",
