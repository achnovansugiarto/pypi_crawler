    "description": "PyCV is a package of C++ and Python modules implementing various algorithms\r\nthat are useful in computer vision, and augments the capabilities of OpenCV.\r\nIn particular, PyCV provides implementations for:\r\n\r\n- Fast training and selection of Haar-like features for a weak classifier\r\n  [Pham2007b]_.  This is currently the world's fastest method for training a face\r\n  detector. It runs in just a few hours, while most existing methods run in\r\n  days or weeks.\r\n- Asymmetric Online Boosting [Pham2007a]_: a variant of AdaBoost that learns\r\n  incrementally using an asymmetric goal as the learning criterion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PyCV contains many useful modules for computer vision and\r\nmachine learning, specially boosting techniques, Haar-like features, and face\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nThe package is primarily developed by Minh-Tri Pham, as part of his PhD\r\nresearch on face detection. This research is being carried out in the Centre\r\nfor Multimedia & Network Technology (CeMNet), School of Computer Engineering,\r\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2007 Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\r\n\r\n:Founding Contributors:\r\n  Minh-Tri Pham <mtpham@ntu.edu.sg> -- Primary author\r\n\r\n  Viet-Dung D.
