    "description": ".. image:: scine_heron/resources/heron_logo.png\n   :alt: SCINE Heron\n\n.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nSCINE Heron is the graphical user interface for all other SCINE modules. It has two main ways of operation.\n\nFirst, one can explore chemical reactivity immersively and interactively based on first principles. The\ngraphical user interface of SCINE Heron displays a three-dimensional molecular structure and allows users\nto interact with it. They can induce structural changes with a computer mouse or a haptic device and perceive\nthe effect of their manipulations immediately through visual and/or haptic feedback. For fast electronic\nstructure calculations, we employ currently different semi-empirical methods, which can deliver properties\nin the millisecond timescale, while providing a qualitatively correct description of the potential energy surface.\n\nSecond, one can interact with explorations done by SCINE Chemoton. One can visualize the chemical reaction\nnetwork without drowning in too much information. For example, one can selectively display reactions with a\nbarrier lower than a certain, user-specified threshold. Furthermore, one can analyze all compounds and reactions\ndiscovered, e.g., for reactions, one can visualize the trajectory and study the energy along it. It is also possible\nto search and visualize all pathways between two given compounds. Any compound discovered by Chemoton can be\ntransferred to the interactive part of the GUI, allowing it to be further studied.\n\nLicense and Copyright Information\n---------------------------------\n\nFor license and copyright information, see the file ``LICENSE.txt`` in this\ndirectory.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPrerequisites\n.............\n\nThe application requires several third-party and SCINE related Python packages to run.\nThese packages can be installed using the following command::\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nYou may want to create and activate a virtual environment first.\n\nAdditional third party packages are used for testing, type checking, and formatting.\nSee ``requirements-dev.txt`` and pypi.org for more information.\nAgain, the packages can be installed using::\n\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n\n\nInstallation\n............\n\nHeron can be installed using pip (pip3) once the repository has been cloned:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   git clone <heron-repo>\n   pip install ./heron\n\nA non super user can install the package using a virtual environment, or\nthe ``--user`` flag.\n\nUsage\n------\n\nStarting the Application\n........................\n\nThe application can be started by the command::\n\n    python3 -m scine_heron\n\nTo open a file with molecule directly from the command line, you can use the ``--file`` option::\n\n    python3 -m scine_heron --file xyz_files/pyridine.xyz\n\nThe application is per default in dark mode. If light mode is preferred, you can use the ``--mode`` option::\n\n    python3 -m scine_heron --mode light\n\n\nShortcuts\n.........\n\nThe application features a range of shortcuts, a few are given here.\n\nGeneral:\n - Scrolling Vertically: Mouse Wheel\n - Scrolling Vertically: Shift + Mouse Wheel\n - Zooming: Ctrl + Mouse Wheel (in the main molecular viewer also without Ctrl modifier)\n - Open Database Connection Dialogue: Ctrl + D\n\nMain Molecular Viewer:\n - Open File: Ctrl + O\n - Save Molecule: Ctrl + S\n - Save Trajectory: Ctrl + Shift + S\n - Start Real Time Calculation: Ctrl + F (if calculator is available and molecule loaded)\n\nAll Network Views:\n  - Copy ID of Focussed Node: Ctrl + C\n\n\nHaptic Device\n-------------\n\nSCINE Heron supports the usage of a haptic device.\nIt allows the user to feel force feedback when manipulating molecules in the\nmain molecular viewer.\nIn order to install and connect a haptic device to SCINE Heron please read the\ninstructions and referenced manuals below.\n\nHaptic Device Install\n.....................\n\nConnect your haptic device. Download `drivers <https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.3dsystems.com/binaries/Sensable/Linux/TouchDriver2019_2_15_Linux.tar.xz>`_\nfor it and install according to the `instructions <https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.3dsystems.com/binaries/Sensable/Linux/Installation+Instructions.pdf>`_.\nRead the `official webpage <https://support.3dsystems.com/s/article/OpenHaptics-for-Linux-Developer-Edition-v34?language=en_US>`_ for more information.\n\nInstall `OpenHaptics SDK <https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.3dsystems.com/binaries/support/downloads/KB+Files/Open+Haptics/openhaptics_3.4-0-developer-edition-amd64.tar.gz>`_.\nRead the `Programmers Guide <https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.3dsystems.com/binaries/support/downloads/KB+Files/Open+Haptics/OpenHaptics_ProgGuide.pdf>`_\nand `API Reference Guide <https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.3dsystems.com/binaries/support/downloads/KB+Files/Open+Haptics/OpenHaptics_RefGuide.pdf>`_\nfor more information.\n\nThen install the ``scine_heron_haptic`` module (see the instructions in the ``haptics/`` subfolder).\n\nHow to Cite\n-----------\n\nWhen publishing results obtained with Heron, please cite the corresponding\nrelease as archived on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_ (please use the DOI of\nthe respective release).\n\nSupport and Contact\n-------------------\n\nIn case you should encounter problems or bugs, please write a short message\nto scine@phys.chem.ethz.ch.\n\n\n",
