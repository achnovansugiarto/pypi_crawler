    "description": "# DOM Tree\n\nSimple API to create DOM trees in Python.\nA bit like JSX, but with native Python syntax.\n\nAims to include useful autocompletion. Currently this works for SVGs.\n\n## Basic example\n```python\nfrom domtree.svg import *\n\nprint(\n    svg(viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\", xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\")(\n        circle(cx=50, cy=50, r=50),\n    )\n)\n\n# <svg viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n#   <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"50\" />\n# </svg>\n```\n\n\n## Generated content\n\n```python\nfrom domtree.svg import *\n\nprint(\n    svg(\n        circle(x=0, y=i * 10, r=2) for i in range(5)\n    )\n)\n\n# <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" version=\"1.1\">\n#   <circle x=\"0\" y=\"0\" r=\"2\" />\n#   <circle x=\"0\" y=\"10\" r=\"2\" />\n#   <circle x=\"0\" y=\"20\" r=\"2\" />\n#   <circle x=\"0\" y=\"30\" r=\"2\" />\n#   <circle x=\"0\" y=\"40\" r=\"2\" />\n# </svg>\n```\n\n## Custom nodes\n```python\nfrom domtree import Node\n\nul = Node(\"ul\")\nli = Node(\"li\")\n\nprint(\n    ul(\n        li(\"First item\"),\n        li(className=\"second\")(\"Second item\")\n    )\n)\n\n# <ul>\n#   <li>\n#     First item\n#   </li>\n#   <li class=\"second\">\n#     Second item\n#   </li>\n# </ul>\n```\n\n## Autocomplete\n\n![Autocomplete demo](./docs/autocomplete-demo.png)\n",
