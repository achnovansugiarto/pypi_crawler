    "description": "# BitCryptoCompare\n\n**A Python wrapper for CryptoCompare API by Bitmast Digital Services.** \n\nBitCryptoCompare is designed to be a Python wrapper of the CryptoCompare API. \n\n## Motivation\nThe advent of cryptocurrency in the financial and other payment systems makes it very pressing to have access to timely and valid information about cryptocurrency. Added to this challenge is the fact that cryptocurrencies have high volatility which can swing investors from huge profits to losses within a fraction of seconds. \nThe story of cryptocurrency is far from its epilogue as new tools and a \"killer application\" is still being researched and pushed out to the public market. Despite all the progress currently registered, an average computer user often considers cryptocurrency and the entire blockchain domain to be an industry shrouded in darkness. This barrier for users can be reduced by improving both the interface by which blockchain technologies are accessed and simplifying the information needed by users to make valuable decisions.\n\nBitmast is poised to producing a simple yet effective tool by which blockchain transactions and related data could be accessed by users. One of the far-reaching goals for this tool is to enable people to access information without heavy cognitive overloads incurred from viewing many charts, numbers, and hashed strings. An integral component for attaining this is a reliable source of cryptocurrency data. We considered the CryptoCompare API a rich and reliable source by which cryptocurrency information can be extracted from data for personal and research purposes.\n\nAside from this, BitCryptoCompare aims to be a simple framework that can be integrated with other Python-based frameworks such as Django, Flask etc.\n\n## Description\nThe BitCryptoCompare is a Python wrapper supporting multiple endpoints of the CryptoCompare API. Some of the key innovative features of the design include:\n\n1. API calls are through callable objects that allow storing and forwarding HTTP requests as objects through the system. \nExample to initiate a request for data, simply follow the steps:\n\n~~~python\n# Initiate a request\nfrom bit_cryptocompare.util.url_factory import single_symbol_price\nfrom bit_cryptocompare.parsers import SingleSymbolPrice\n\nserver_response = single_symbol_price('BTC', 'XLM,LTC,DASH', try_conversion=True,\n                              relaxed_validation=True,\n                              exchange='Kraken',\n                              extras='Bitmast Explorer', sign=False)\ndata = SingleSymbolPrice.parse(server_response)                \n # further process server_response or return to caller\n\n~~~ \n\n2. Application-specific requirements and account details can be managed from a centralized configuration system. This will enable developers to extend the project for their peculiar needs.\n\n3. A set of data validation is provided for selected request object/data being passed to the CryptoCompare API. Furthermore, the default data validation can be replaced or extended by the developer to suit their target need. \nIt is believed, however, that default validation meets the requirements \nfor most cases.\n\n4. A `parser` module is provided for converting responses from the \nCryptoCompare server into target native system objects. Responses from the server can also be converted into native dictionary objects or passed along to calling a function.\n\n5. All HTTP requests are made through the Python `requests` API. \nSee documentation [here](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) \nfor more information.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe BitCryptoCompare requires `requests` which can be downloaded \n[here](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). \n\nThe Python language version for current implementation is Python 3.6.8 \n\n## Build Status\n**Version: 0.0.1**\n\nCurrent development of BitCryptoCompare is version 0.0.1 \nThis is considered the Alpha Edition. \n\n## Features\nThe current edition covers the following API endpoints.\n\n| API Endpoints |\n| ------------- |\n| Single Symbol Price |  \n| Multiple Symbols Price |  \n| Multiple Symbols Full Data |  \n| Generated Custom Average |  \n| Latest News Articles |  \n| List News Feeds |  \n| News Article Categories |  \n| List News Feeds and Categories |  \n| Exchanges With Order Book Data |  \n| Order Book L1 Top |  \n| Order Book L2 Snapshot |  \n| All the Exchanges and Trading Pairs |  \n| All the Coins |  \n| All Exchanges General Info |  \n| Coins General Info |  \n\nInformation about the CryptoCompare API can be found \n[here](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation). \n\n## Contributing\nPlease visit application repo for further information on extending the project. \nIdeas and comments are welcome. \n\n## Author\nCurrent development is by Aniefiok Friday \n[@frier17](https://gitlab.com/frier17). \n\n## License\nApache License \nVersion 2.0, January 2004\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/\nFor details read license contract \n[here](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\nCopyright 2019 @frier17\n\n Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n limitations under the License.\n\n\n\n",
