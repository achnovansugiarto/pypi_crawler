    "description": "# pcontract\n\nA data structure to track data over time. It works by tracking time/schedule\ninformation **rather than tracking data changes** over time.\n\n\n## Reasoning\n\nLet's assume you make a contract with a person (in this example,\nassume it's a lease agreement). In the first draft, the  parties agree on\nsome conditions, and if they are happy, they close the deal.\n\nNow, assume after some time, one of the parties need to amend some\nchanges, (after the fact that the contract was in place), in which case the\noriginal contract would be nulled and a new contract would be drafted.\nThis new contract now spans a different time period and the conditions are\nchanged.\n\nIn this case the tenant would have held of the leased place for some time\n(say a month) until the amended contract was in place.\n\nTo account for this interval, amended contract could be drafted so that it would\nencompass the past month.\n\nHowever, the world of leasing is not perfect and sometimes one of the parties\nwill need to pursue this one-month interval according to the original contract\n(e.g., the landlord increased the rent, but it will become effective in the\ncoming month). In such a case, there needs to be a contract for the one-month\ninterval since the original contract spans more than that.\n\nAs such, we need a way to create contracts and amend them without having to\nthink about these intervals; things get more complex if the amending is not\npermanent but transitory (e.g., effective only for some limited time during\nthe original contract).\n\n## How it works\n\nIn order to create a contract, you need to use a `Collection` type, which is a\ncontainer for `Branch` i.e, contracts. You may initialize a basic contract by:\n\n```python\ncollection = Collection.init(\n    start_at=datetime(2022, 12, 1),\n    end_at=datetime(2023, 12, 1),\n    data={\"hello\": \"world\"},\n)\n```\n\nThe example above creates a contract that spans one year, with given data. In\norder to amend a contract, you may use `Collection.branch`:\n\n```\ncollection.branch(\n    start_at=datetime(2023, 6, 1),\n    data={\"hello\": \"moon\"}\n)\n```\n\nThis change will create additional branches that describe the data over time.\nYou may see the branch information by using the `Collection.explain` method.\nThe example above will create a total of three contracts:\n\n- One for the original contract (spanning 1 year).\n- One for the interval between original start and amended start.\n- One for the interval between amended start and amended end.\n\nThe first contract will be disabled since it won't be relevant in after the\nlatest changes.\n\n\n## Example\n\nJack is a farmer that sells eggs, and Janet is a baker that sells cakes (using\neggs, obviously). Jack and Janet make a contract in which Jack agrees to provide\nJanet 10 eggs every day, for one year.\n\n```python\ncollection = Collection.init(\n    start_at=datetime(2022, 12, 1),\n    end_at=datetime(2023, 12, 1),\n    data={\"eggs_per_day\": 10},\n)\n```\n\nA couple of months pass, and Janet realizes that the easter is coming,\nin which period cake requests are doubled. Now Janet needs 20 eggs per day,\ninstead of the usual 10. So a new agreement is made in which Janet would receive\n20 eggs a day during the easter period:\n\n```python\ncollection.branch(\n    start_at=datetime(2023, 4, 1),\n    end_at=datetime(2023, 5, 1),\n    data={\"eggs_per_day\": 20},\n)\n```\n\nShortly after the easter period, Janet sees an increase in sales thanks to the\ndelicious cakes she sold during the easter period. So she makes a new agreement\nwith Jack in which the number of eggs per day is increased to 15:\n\n```python\ncollection.branch(\n    start_at=datetime(2023, 5, 16),\n    data={\"eggs_per_day\": 15},\n)\n```\n\nNow let's look at what happened, output from `collection.gantt()`:\n\n![Gannt chart](docs/example.png)\n\nIn the example above, each line represents a contract (hence a `Branch`instance)\nyou can track how the date changes by following blue lines. Red lines indicate\ncontracts that were replaced by newer ones (i.e., they are no longer relevant).\n",
