After review, pull requests\nwill be pushed to the GitLab project and merged there.\n\nNOMAD's [GitLab project](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-FAIR) at [MPCDF](https://www.mpcdf.mpg.de/)\nis used for the main development activities. It runs all CI/CD pipelines and official deployments.\nIt is openly readable, but requires an MPCDF account for active contributions.\n\nMost sub-modules, e.g. NOMAD's parsers, are hosted in individual projects on GitHUB\nwithin the [nomad-coe organization](https://github.com/nomad-coe).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Using NOMAD as a Python package\n\nYou can install the `nomad` Python package from source distribution with pip. Please\nnote, that this will only install part of NOMAD's dependencies that will only allow\nyour to use NOMAD's client library, e.g. to access the NOMAD Archive.\n```\npip install nomad-lab\n```\n\nTo **use the NOMAD parsers for example**, install the `parsing` extra:\n```\npip install nomad-lab[parsing]\nnomad parse --show-archive <your-file-to-parse>\n```\n\n### For NOMAD developer\n\nRead the latest [docs](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/index.html). The documentation is also part\nof the source code. It covers aspects like introduction, architecture, development setup/deployment,\ncontributing, and API reference.\n\n\n## Change log\n\nOmitted versions are plain bugfix releases with only minor changes and fixes.
