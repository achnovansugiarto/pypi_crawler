Ruckig calculates a trajectory to a *target* waypoint (with position, velocity, and acceleration) starting from *any* initial state limited by velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. Besides the target state, Ruckig allows to define intermediate positions for waypoint following. For state-to-state motions, Ruckig guarantees a time-optimal solution. With intermediate waypoints, Ruckig calculates the path and its time parametrization jointly, resulting in significantly faster trajectories compared to traditional methods. \n\nMore information can be found at [ruckig.com](https://ruckig.com) and in the corresponding paper [Jerk-limited Real-time Trajectory Generation with Arbitrary Target States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04830), accepted for the *Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS), 2021* conference.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nRuckig has no dependencies (except for testing). To build Ruckig using CMake, just run\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\nmake\n```\n\nTo install Ruckig in a system-wide directory, use `(sudo) make install`. An example of using Ruckig in your CMake project is given by `examples/CMakeLists.txt`. However, you can also include Ruckig as a directory within your project and call `add_subdirectory(ruckig)` in your parent `CMakeLists.txt`. To enable the [Online API](http://api.ruckig.com/docs) for intermediate waypoints, just pass the `BUILD_ONLINE_CLIENT` flag to CMake. \n\nRuckig is also available as a Python module, in particular for development or debugging purposes. The Ruckig *Community Version* can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ruckig/) via\n```bash\npip install ruckig\n```\nWhen using CMake, the Python module can be built using the `BUILD_PYTHON_MODULE` flag. If you're only interested in the Python module (and not in the C++ library), you can build and install Ruckig via `pip install .`.\n\n\n## Tutorial\n\nFurthermore, we will explain the basics to get started with online generated trajectories within your application. There is also a [collection of examples](https://docs.ruckig.com/pages.html) that guide you through the most important features of Ruckig. A time-optimal trajectory for a single degree of freedom is shown in the figure below. We also added plots for the resulting trajectories of all examples. Let's get started!\n\n![Trajectory Profile](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/raw/master/doc/example_profile.png?raw=true)\n\n\n### Waypoint-based Trajectory Generation\n\nRuckig provides three main interface classes: the *Ruckig*, the *InputParameter*, and the *OutputParameter* class.\n\nFirst, you'll need to create a Ruckig instance with the number of DoFs as a template parameter, and the control cycle (e.g. in seconds) in the constructor.\n\n```.cpp\nRuckig<6> ruckig {0.001}; // Number DoFs; control cycle in [s]\n```\n\nThe input type has 3 blocks of data: the *current* state, the *target* state and the corresponding kinematic *limits*.\n\n```.cpp\nInputParameter<6> input; // Number DoFs\ninput.current_position = {0.2, ...};\ninput.current_velocity = {0.1, ...};\ninput.current_acceleration = {0.1, ...};\ninput.target_position = {0.5, ...};\ninput.target_velocity = {-0.1, ...};\ninput.target_acceleration = {0.2, ...};\ninput.max_velocity = {0.4, ...};\ninput.max_acceleration = {1.0, ...};\ninput.max_jerk = {4.0, ...};\n\nOutputParameter<6> output; // Number DoFs\n```\n\nGiven all input and output resources, we can iterate over the trajectory at each discrete time step. For most applications, this loop must run within a real-time thread and controls the actual hardware.\n\n```.cpp\nwhile (ruckig.update(input, output) == Result::Working) {\n  // Make use of the new state here!\n  // e.g. robot->setJointPositions(output.new_position);\n\n  output.pass_to_input(input); // Don't forget this!\n}\n```\n\nWithin the control loop, you need to update the *current state* of the input parameter according to the calculated trajectory. Therefore, the `pass_to_input` method copies the new kinematic state of the output to the current kinematic state of the input parameter. If (in the next step) the current state is not the expected, pre-calculated trajectory, Ruckig will calculate a new trajectory based on the novel input. When the trajectory has reached the target state, the `update` function will return `Result::Finished`.\n\n\n### Intermediate Waypoints\n\nThe Ruckig Community Version now supports intermediate waypoints via a [remote API](http://api.ruckig.com/docs). Make sure to include `-DBUILD_ONLINE_CLIENT=ON` as a CMake flag when compiling - the PyPI Python version should bring that out of the box. To allocate the necessary memory for a variable number of waypoints beforehand, we need to pass the maximum number of waypoints to Ruckig via\n```.cpp\nRuckig<6> otg {0.001, 8};\nInputParameter<6> input {8};\nOutputParameter<6> output {8};\n```\nThe `InputParameter` class takes the number of waypoints as an optional input, however usually you will fill in the values (and therefore reserve its memory) yourself. Then you're ready to set intermediate via points by\n```.cpp\ninput.intermediate_positions = {\n  {0.2, ...},\n  {0.8, ...},\n};\n```\nAs soon as at least one intermediate positions is given, the Ruckig Community Version switches to the mentioned (of course, non real-time capable) remote API. If you require real-time calculation on your own hardware, please contact us for the *Ruckig Pro Version*.\n\nWhen using *intermediate positions*, both the underlying motion planning problem as well as its calculation changes significantly. In particular, there are some fundamental limitations for jerk-limited online trajectory generation regarding the usage of waypoints. Please find more information about these limitations [here](https://docs.ruckig.com/md_pages_intermediate_waypoints.html), and in general we recommend to use\n```.cpp\ninput.intermediate_positions = otg.filter_intermediate_positions(input.intermediate_positions, {0.1, ...});\n```\nto filter waypoints according to a (high) threshold distance. Setting *interrupt_calculation_duration* makes sure to be real-time capable by refining the solution in the next control invocation. Note that this is a soft interruption of the calculation. Currently, no minimum or discrete durations are supported when using intermediate positions.\n\n\n### Input Parameter\n\nTo go into more detail, the *InputParameter* type has following members:\n\n```.cpp\nusing Vector = std::array<double, DOFs>; // By default\n\nVector current_position;\nVector current_velocity; // Initialized to zero\nVector current_acceleration; // Initialized to zero\n\nstd::vector<Vector> intermediate_positions; // (only in Pro Version)\n\nVector target_position;\nVector target_velocity; // Initialized to zero\nVector target_acceleration; // Initialized to zero\n\nVector max_velocity;\nVector max_acceleration;\nVector max_jerk;\n\nstd::optional<Vector> min_velocity; // If not given, the negative maximum velocity will be used.\nstd::optional<Vector> min_acceleration; // If not given, the negative maximum acceleration will be used.\n\nstd::optional<Vector> min_position; // (only in Pro Version)\nstd::optional<Vector> max_position; // (only in Pro Version)\n\nstd::array<bool, DOFs> enabled; // Initialized to true\nstd::optional<double> minimum_duration;\nstd::optional<double> interrupt_calculation_duration; // [µs], (only in Pro Version)\n\nControlInterface control_interface; // The default position interface controls the full kinematic state.\nSynchronization synchronization; // Synchronization behavior of multiple DoFs\nDurationDiscretization duration_discretization; // Whether the duration should be a discrete multiple of the control cycle (off by default)\n\nstd::optional<Vector<ControlInterface>> per_dof_control_interface; // Sets the control interface for each DoF individually, overwrites global control_interface\nstd::optional<Vector<Synchronization>> per_dof_synchronization; // Sets the synchronization for each DoF individually, overwrites global synchronization\n```\n\nOn top of the current state, target state, and constraints, Ruckig allows for a few more advanced settings:\n- A *minimum* velocity and acceleration can be specified - these should be a negative number. If they are not given, the negative maximum velocity or acceleration will be used (similar to the jerk limit). For example, this might be useful in human robot collaboration settings with a different velocity limit towards a human. Or, when switching between different moving coordinate frames like picking from a conveyer belt.\n- You can overwrite the global kinematic limits to specify limits for each section between two waypoints separately by using e.g. `per_section_max_velocity`.\n- If a DoF is not *enabled*, it will be ignored in the calculation. Ruckig will output a trajectory with constant acceleration for those DoFs.\n- A *minimum duration* can be optionally given. Note that Ruckig can not guarantee an exact, but only a minimum duration of the trajectory.\n- The control interface (position or velocity control) can be switched easily. For example, a stop trajectory or visual servoing can be easily implemented with the velocity interface.\n- Different synchronization behaviors (i.a. phase, time, or no synchonization) are implemented. Phase synchronization results in straight-line motions.\n- The trajectory duration might be constrained to a multiple of the control cycle. This way, the *exact* state can be reached at a control loop execution.\n\nWe refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.ruckig.com/namespaceruckig.html) of the enumerations within the `ruckig` namespace for all available options.\n\n\n### Input Validation\n\nTo check that Ruckig is able to generate a trajectory before the actual calculation step,\n```.cpp\nruckig.validate_input(input, check_current_state_within_limits=false, check_target_state_within_limits=true);\n// returns boolean\n```\nreturns `false` if an input is not valid. The two boolean arguments check that the current or target state are within the limits. The check includes a typical catch of jerk-limited trajectory generation: When the current state is at maximal velocity, any positive acceleration will inevitable lead to a velocity violation *at a future timestep*. In general, this condition is fulfilled when\n```\nAbs(acceleration) <= Sqrt(2 * max_jerk * (max_velocity - Abs(velocity))).\n```\nIf both arguments are set to true, the calculated trajectory is guaranteed to be *within the kinematic limits throughout* its duration. Also, note that there are range constraints of the input due to numerical reasons, see below for more details.\n\n\n### Result Type\n\nThe `update` function of the Ruckig class returns a Result type that indicates the current state of the algorithm. This can either be **working**, **finished** if the trajectory has finished, or an **error** type if something went wrong during calculation. The result type can be compared as a standard integer.\n\nState                           | Error Code\n------------------------------- | ----------\nWorking                         | 0\nFinished                        | 1\nError                           | -1\nErrorInvalidInput               | -100\nErrorTrajectoryDuration         | -101\nErrorPositionalLimits           | -102\nErrorExecutionTimeCalculation   | -110\nErrorSynchronizationCalculation | -111\n\n\n### Output Parameter\n\nThe output class includes the new kinematic state and the overall trajectory.\n\n```.cpp\nVector new_position;\nVector new_velocity;\nVector new_acceleration;\n\nTrajectory trajectory; // The current trajectory\ndouble time; // The current, auto-incremented time. Reset to 0 at a new calculation.\n\nsize_t new_section; // Index of the section between two (possibly filtered) intermediate positions.\nbool did_section_change; // Was a new section reached in the last cycle?\n\nbool new_calculation; // Whether a new calculation was performed in the last cycle\nbool was_calculation_interrupted; // Was the trajectory calculation interrupted? (only in Pro Version)\ndouble calculation_duration; // Duration of the calculation in the last cycle [µs]\n```\nMoreover, the **trajectory** class has a range of useful parameters and methods.\n\n```.cpp\ndouble duration; // Duration of the trajectory\nstd::array<double, DOFs> independent_min_durations; // Time-optimal profile for each independent DoF\n\n<...> at_time(double time); // Get the kinematic state of the trajectory at a given time\n<...> get_position_extrema(); // Returns information about the position extrema and their times\n```\nAgain, we refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.ruckig.com) for the exact signatures.\n\n\n### Offline Calculation\n\nRuckig also supports an offline approach for calculating a trajectory:\n```.cpp\nresult = ruckig.calculate(input, trajectory);\n```\nWhen only using this method, the `Ruckig` constructor does not need a control cycle (`delta_time`) as an argument. However if given, Ruckig supports stepping through the trajectory with\n```.cpp\nwhile (ruckig.update(trajectory, output) == Result::Working) {\n  // Make use of the new state here!\n  // e.g. robot->setJointPositions(output.new_position);\n}\n```\nstarting from the current `output.time` (currently Ruckig Pro only).\n\n\n### Tracking Interface\n\nWhen following an arbitrary signal with position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk-limitation, the straight forward way would be to pass the current state to Ruckig's target state. However, as the resulting trajectory will take time to catch up, this approach will always lag behind the signal. The tracking interface solves this problem by predicting ahead (e.g. with constant acceleration by default) and is therefore able to follow signals very closely in a time-optimal way. This might be very helpful for (general) tracking, robot servoing, or trajectory post-processing applications. \n\nTo use the tracking interface, construct\n```.cpp\nTrackig<1> otg {0.01};  // control cycle\n```\nand set the current state as well as the kinematic constraints via\n```.cpp\ninput.current_position = {0.0};\ninput.current_velocity = {0.0};\ninput.current_acceleration = {0.0};\ninput.max_velocity = {0.8};\ninput.max_acceleration = {2.0};\ninput.max_jerk = {5.0};\n```\nThen, we can track a signal in an online manner within the real-time control loop \n```.cpp\nfor (double t = 0; t < 10.0; t += otg.delta_time) {\n  auto target_state = signal(t); // signal returns position, velocity, and acceleration\n  auto res = otg.update(target_state, input, output);\n  // Make use of the smooth target motion here (e.g. output.new_position)\n\n  output.pass_to_input(input);\n}\n```\nPlease find a complete example [here](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/blob/master/examples/13_tracking.cpp). This functionality can also be used in an offline manner, e.g. when the entire signal is known beforehand. Here, we call the\n```.cpp \nsmooth_trajectory = otg.calculate_trajectory(target_states, input);\n```\nmethod with the trajectory given as a `std::vector` of target states. The Tracking interface is available in the Ruckig Pro version.\n\n\n### Dynamic Number of Degrees of Freedom\n\nSo far, we have told Ruckig the number of DoFs as a template parameter. If you don't know the number of DoFs at compile-time, you can set the template parameter to `ruckig::DynamicDOFs` and pass the DoFs to the constructor:\n\n```.cpp\nRuckig<DynamicDOFs> otg {6, 0.001};\nInputParameter<DynamicDOFs> input {6};\nOutputParameter<DynamicDOFs> output {6};\n```\n\nHowever, we recommend to keep the template parameter when possible: First, it has a performance benefit of a few percent. Second, it is convenient for real-time programming due to its easier handling of memory allocations. When using dynamic degrees of freedom, make sure to allocate the memory of all vectors beforehand.\n\n\n### Custom Vector Types\n\nRuckig supports custom vector types to make interfacing with your code even easier and more flexible. Most importantly, you can switch to [Eigen Vectors](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) simply by including Eigen (3.4 or later) before Ruckig\n```.cpp\n#include <Eigen/Core> // Version 3.4 or later\n#include <ruckig/ruckig.hpp>\n```\nand then call the constructors with the `ruckig::EigenVector` parameter.\n```.cpp\nRuckig<6, EigenVector> otg {0.001};\nInputParameter<6, EigenVector> input;\nOutputParameter<6, EigenVector> output;\n```\nNow every in- and output of Ruckig's API (such as `current_position`, `new_position` or `max_jerk`) are Eigen types! To define completely custom vector types, you can pass a C++ [template template parameter](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters) to the constructor. This template template parameter needs to fulfill a range of template arguments and methods:\n```.cpp\ntemplate<class Type, size_t DOFs>\nstruct MinimalVector {\n  Type operator[](size_t i) const; // Array [] getter\n  Type& operator[](size_t i); // Array [] setter\n  size_t size() const; // Current size\n  bool operator==(const MinimalVector<T, DOFs>& rhs) const; // Equal comparison operator\n\n  // Only required in combination with DynamicDOFs, e.g. to allocate memory\n  void resize(size_t size);\n};\n```\nNote that `DynamicDOFs` corresponds to `DOFs = 0`. We've included a range of examples for using Ruckig with [(10) Eigen](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/blob/master/examples/10_eigen_vector_type.cpp), [(11) custom vector types](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/blob/master/examples/11_custom_vector_type.cpp), and [(12) custom types with a dynamic number of DoFs](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/blob/master/examples/12_custom_vector_type_dynamic_dofs.cpp).\n\n\n## Tests and Numerical Stability\n\nThe current test suite validates over 5.000.000.000 random trajectories as well as many additional edge cases. The numerical exactness is tested for the final position and final velocity to be within `1e-8`, for the final acceleration to be within `1e-10`, and for the velocity, acceleration and jerk limit to be within of a numerical error of `1e-12`. These are absolute values - we suggest to scale your input so that these correspond to your required precision of the system. For example, for most real-world systems we suggest to use input values in `[m]` (instead of e.g. `[mm]`), as `1e-8m` is sufficient precise for practical trajectory generation. Furthermore, all kinematic limits should be below `1e12`. The maximal supported trajectory duration is `7e3`, and you can [scale your input parameter](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/issues/139#issuecomment-1280730316) to avoid that limitation. Note that Ruckig will also output values outside of this range, there is however no guarantee for correctness.\n\n\n## Benchmark\n\nWe find that Ruckig is more than twice as fast as Reflexxes Type IV for state-to-state motions and well-suited for control cycles as low as 250 microseconds. The Ruckig *Community Version* is in general a more powerful and open-source alternative to the [Reflexxes Type IV](http://reflexxes.ws/) library. In fact, Ruckig is the first Type V trajectory generator for arbitrary target states and even supports directional velocity and acceleration limits, while also being faster on top.\n\n![Benchmark](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/raw/master/doc/benchmark.png?raw=true)\n\nFor trajectories with intermediate waypoints, we compare Ruckig to [Toppra](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra), a state-of-the-art library for robotic motion planning. Ruckig is able to improve the trajectory duration on average by around 10%, as the path planning and time parametrization are calculated jointly. Moreover, Ruckig is real-time capable and supports jerk-constraints.\n\n![Benchmark](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig/raw/master/doc/ruckig_toppra_example.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\n## Development\n\nRuckig is written in C++17. It is continuously tested on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest` against following versions\n\n- Doctest v2.4 (only for testing)\n- Pybind11 v2.9 (only for python wrapper)\n\nIf you still need to use C++11, you can patch the Ruckig *Community Version* by calling `bash scripts/patch-c++11.sh`. Note that this will result in a performance drop of a few percent. Moreover, the Python module is not supported.\n\n\n## Used By\n\nRuckig is used by over hundred research labs, companies, and open-source projects worldwide, including:\n- [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org) for trajectory generation.\n- [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) starting from version 4.3.\n- [Fuzzy Logic Robotics](https://flr.io)\n- [Gestalt Robotics](https://www.gestalt-robotics.com)\n- [Struckig](https://github.com/stefanbesler/struckig), a port of Ruckig to Structered Text (ST - IEC61131-3) for usage on PLCs.\n- [Frankx](https://github.com/pantor/frankx) for controlling the Franka Emika robot arm.\n- and many others!\n\n\n## Citation\n\n```\n@article{berscheid2021jerk,\n  title={Jerk-limited Real-time Trajectory Generation with Arbitrary Target States},\n  author={Berscheid, Lars and Kr{\\\"o}ger, Torsten},\n  journal={Robotics: Science and Systems XVII},\n  year={2021}\n}\n```\n",
