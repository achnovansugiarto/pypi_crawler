    "description": "# BrainRender\n`brainrender` is a python package for the visualization of three dimensional anatomical data from mice brains registered to the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) from the Allen Institute. \nPlease check the [user guide](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/UserGuide.md) and the [examples](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Examples) notebooks for more information on how to use BrainRender.\n\nFor more information about `brainrender` and how to use it, checkout the [brainrender preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961748v1).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/streamlines2.png\" width=\"1000\">\n\n# Installation\nTo install `brainrender`, use an existing python environment or create one [with `python < 3.8`] and install with:\n```\npip install brainrender\n```\n\n\n# Description\n`brainrender` can be used to download and visualize anatomical data from publicly available datasets as well as user generated content. Data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and Allen Mouse Connectome projects can be used to visualise the three dimensional morphology of brain region and obtain a qualitative understanding of the I/O connective of a region of interest. \nBrainrender can also be used to visualise reconstructed neuronal morphologies, either by downloading them directly from MouseLight project from Janelia Research campus, or by rendering reconstructions obtained from elsewhere (e.g. from [neuromorpho.org](http://neuromorpho.org)).\n\nIn addition, `brainrender` can be used to visualise data generated within your lab. Brainrender can be used to visualise the results of tracing experiments (e.g. location of the injection site and labelled cells) and to visualise the location of chronically implanted device (such as electrodes arrays or optic fibres). \n\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/summary_figure.png)\n\n\n## Publicly available datasets\n### Allen Mouse Brain Atlas\nAnatomical and projection data is downloaded from the  Allen Brain Atlas [reference atlas](http://atlas.brain-map.org)\nand [connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org) using the Allen [API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI)\n(Â© 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Brain Atlas API. Available from: [brain-map.org/api/index.html](brain-map.org/api/index.html)) ([1], [2]).\n\n### Brain structures\nBrain structures are the most fundamental element of any `brainrender` scene. You can use brainrender to select which brain regions you'd like to visualise, and how they should look (color, transparency...). Brainrender then takes care of downloading and rendering the 3D mesh for the selected regions. \n\n### Streamlines\nEfferent anatomical projections  from a region of interest as determined by local injections of an anterogradely transported virus (see [Allen's connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org)) can be rendered as 'streamlines'.\n\nStreamlines reconstructions are made by [https://neuroinformatics.nl](https://neuroinformatics.nl) using the mouse connectome data from Allen (see [here](https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/allen-connectivity-viewer/streamline-downloader.html) for more details). \nBrainrender automatically downloads and renders streamlines data for a brain region of interest. \n\n\nBrain structures             |  Afferent projections\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/brainregions.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/tractography.png)\n\nEfferent projections             |  MouseLight neurons\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/streamlines.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/morphology.png)\n\n### Afferent projections\nThe same data used to extract information about efferent projections, can be visualised in an alternative way to look at afferent projections to a region of interest. In `brainrender` this type of data visualisation is called tractography. \nBrainrender can be used to select the subset of experiment (injection of an anterograde virus expressing a fluorescent marker) which resulted in fluorescence in the region of interest from the >1000 experiments in the Allen Mouse Connectome project. \nThe location of virus injection and the projection from that location to the region of itnerest is then displayed. \n\n### Mouselight and neurons morphology\nTo look at the morphology of single neurons in the mouse brain, `brainrender` can be used to download and render single\nneurons morphological data from Janelia's [mouse light](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight) database\n(see the [neurons browser](http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org)). [3]\nThese reconstructions are aligned to the Allen brain atlas, so the neurons morphology can be visualised along other types of data (e.g. efferent/afferent projections) in `brainrender`.\n\nBrainrender can be used to visualise neuronal morphologies from other sources by loading `.swc` files directly. \nAdditionally, `brainrender` can also be used to download morphologies from the Allen Cell Types project. \nA large number of neuronal morphologies can be found at [neuromorpho.org](https://www.neuromorpho.org).\n\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/neuron.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/neuron2.png) |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/neuron3.png)\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n\n\n## User generated content\nBrainrender can be used to visualise data generated within individual labs, such as the results of a tracing experiments. \n\nInjection site             |  Labelled neurons\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/inj_site.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/labelled_cells.png)\n\nThis often requires that the raw data be registered to the Allen atlas, before being visualised in brainrender.\nThis functionality is not supported in `brainrender`, however brainrender can be used to visualise data registered with other packages such as `amap` ([github repo](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap-python)) and `cellfinder` ([github repo](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/cellfinder)).\n\n\nYou can also use `brainrender` to visualise the position of devices implanted in the brain (e.g. optic cannula). \nAt the moment this can only be done by rendering colored cylinders at the location where the implant is, but we're happy to add more functionality, get in touch if you need anything specific!\n\n\nOptic fibre             |  Electrodes array\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/cannula.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/electrodes.png)\n\n## Making figures\nBrainrender's high quality renderings can be exported as `.png` images directly within brainrender, facilitating the creation of figure for scientific talks and publications. \n\nMouseLight neuron             |  Labelled cells\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/neuron_gif.gif) |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/cells.gif)\n\nBrainrender can also be used to create videos and animations. At the moment this functionality is not well supported, if you need to do something that brainrender can't yet do, please get in touch!\n\n\n# Behind the scenes\nBrainrender was deisgned to be a powerful and flexible software for downloading and rendering neuroanatomical data while still being relatively easy to use (using brainrender requires minimal coding experience). \nThis was achieved by: \n  1) handling the interaction with the API, SDK and databases services used to find and download the data behind the scenes, requiring minimal user input. \n  2) Using [vtkplotter](https://vtkplotter.embl.es) to handle the rendering. Vtkplotter  ([github repo](https://github.com/marcomusy/vtkPlotter)) is a powerful rendering engine that produces high quality three dimensional rendering. Vtkplotter is also flexible, meaning that it can handle data provided in various file formats, allowing `brainrender` to render data from various sources. \n\n# Getting in touch\nIf you're unsure how to use `brainrender`, please start by having a look at the  [user guide](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/UserGuide.md) and the [examples](Examples) notebooks. If you still have unanswered questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch (the easiest way is to open an issue on github). \n\nFor any bug report or feature request, please open an issue with a brief description of the matter. \nAlthough brainrender can already to much, we are always happy to add more functionality that could be useful for users. If you spot some feature that is missing, we'd love to hear about is so please get in touch!\n\n## Referencing Brain Render\nIf you found BrainRender useful and decided to include a rendering in your talks, posters or article, please acknowledge BrainRender's contribution by citing the [brainrender preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961748v1) as:\n```\nBrainrender.
