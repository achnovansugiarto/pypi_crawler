    "description": "# Async Task\nA simple library for managing asynchrony; inspired by [Microsoft's Task Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?view=net-7.0).\n\n## Motivation\nasync_task provides an equally accessible syntax to the `async` and `await`\nkeywords, but with simpler usage semantics, particularly when calling asynchronous code from within synchronous code. \n\n## Usage\nImport the `Async` class from `async_tasks` and use as a wrapper for callable objects to execute them asynchronously, or\napply as a decorator to permanently transform a function or method into an Async object. \n\nInvoke Async instances as any other callable. The return of the call will be an `Async.Worker` instance. Workers have a `wait` \nmethod and a `result` property; when either of these are called, the caller will synchronize with the background worker, \nblocking until completion or timeout.  \ne.g.:\n\n```python\nfrom async_task import Async\n\n@Async\ndef func():\n    return 0\n\nworker = func()\nworker.wait(1) \nassert worker.result == 0\n# it is not necessary to call wait() prior to accessing result, however, it is not possible to provide a timeout with \n# result.\n```\n\n```python\nfrom async_task import Async\n\ndef func():\n    return 0\n\nasync_obj = Async(func)\nworker = async_obj() \nassert func() == worker.result\n```\n\n```python\nfrom async_task import Async\n\nclass Cls:\n    def __init__(self, attr):\n        self.attr = attr\n    @Async\n    def func(self):\n        return self.attr\n\nassert Cls(0).func().result == 0\n```\n",
