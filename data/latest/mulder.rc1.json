    "description": "# The Mulder library\n\n(_MUon fLux unDER_)\n\n\n## Description\n\nMulder is utility library for computing local deformations of the flux of\natmospheric due to geophysical features, e.g. taking into account a local\ntopography described by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).\n\nThe master component of Mulder is a fluxmeter, which behaves as a portable probe\nof the local flux of atmospheric muons. The level of details of fluxmeters is\nconfigurable, from a fast continuous approximation delivering an average flux\nestimate, to a detailed Monte Carlo delivering discrete (weighted) atmospheric\nmuon events (at the observation point).\n\nNote that Mulder only simulates the transport of atmospheric muons, taking into\naccount the local features surrounding the fluxmeter. That is, Mulder does\nnot simulate muons production at height. Instead, a (configurable) reference\nspectrum of atmospheric muons is used as input, providing the opensky flux, i.e.\nthe flux in the absence of any ground or other obstacles than the Earth\natmosphere.\n\nMulder has a high level Python 3 interface, allowing one to configure and run\nthe core C library (`libmulder`). The C library can also be used directly, for\nexample as a generator of atmospheric muons for a C/C++ detector simulation.\nNote however that the C library is bare-bones. High level customization\noperations are intended to be done from Python. The C library only loads tables\nat initialisation (e.g. produced from Python), and then it runs (produces muon\nevents) accordingly.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### From PyPI\n\nOn Linux, the `mulder` Python package can be installed with `pip` as\n\n```\npip install mulder\n```\n\nNote that Python (3.6, or more) is required (thus you might need to use `pip3`\ninstead of `pip`, depending on your system). The C library is bundled with the\nPython package. In order to compile C/C++ projects, the `mulder` executable,\nshipped with the Python package might be helpful. For example, the following\nreturns installation dependant compilation flags\n\n```\nmulder config --cflags --libs\n```\n\n\n### From source\n\nMulder source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/niess/mulder). Note\nthat the library depends on other projects (_git submodules_), the like\n[Pumas][PUMAS] and [Turtle][TURTLE]. The complete tree, including dependencies,\ncan be cloned as\n\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/niess/mulder.git\n```\n\n(_note the `--recursive` in the previous command._)\n\nThen, the Python package can be built with the provided Makefile, as\n\n```\ncd mulder\nmake package\n```\n\nThis builds the package locally. Thus, you might also add the corresponding path\nto your `PYTHONPATH`, e.g. as following in bash\n\n```\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH\n```\n\nThe C example(s) can be compiled as\n\n```\nmake examples\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Mulder library is currently in alpha stage. As so, there is no dedicated\ndocumentation. However, the Python package has detailed [examples][EXAMPLES]. A\nbrief example of usage in C is also provided.\n\n\n## License\n\nThe Mulder library is under the GNU LGPLv3 license. See the provided\n[LICENSE][LICENSE] and [COPYING.LESSER][COPYING] files. The [examples][EXAMPLES]\nhowever have a separate public domain license allowing them to be copied without\nany restriction.\n\n\n[COPYING]: https://github.com/niess/mulder/blob/master/COPYING.LESSER\n[EXAMPLES]: https://github.com/niess/mulder/tree/master/examples\n[LICENSE]: https://github.com/niess/mulder/blob/master/LICENSE\n[PUMAS]: https://github.com/niess/pumas\n[TURTLE]: https://github.com/niess/turtle\n",
