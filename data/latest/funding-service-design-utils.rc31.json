    "description": "# funding-service-design-utils\nShared library for funding service design apps.\n\nThis library can be installed into other python repos and the packages used by those repos.\n\n# Dev setup\nIn order to run the unit tests, setup a virtual env and install requirements\n1. Checkout the code\n1. Setup a venv and activate: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`\n1. Install dev requirements: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n1. Install pre-commit hook: `pre-commit install`\n1. Run tests with `pytest`\n1. If you add any packages needed by services that consume `fsd_utils`, add them into `pyproject.yaml`.\n\n# Releasing\nTo create a new release of funding-service-design-utils:\n1. Make and test your changes as normal in this repo\n2. Update the `version` tag in `pyproject.toml`\n3. Push your changes to `main`.\n4. The Action at `.github/workflows/test-and-tag.yml` will create a new tag and release, named for the version in `pyproject.toml`. This is triggered automatically on a push to main.\n5. That action will also push this tag up to PyPI at: https://pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/\n\n## Updating the release workflow\n- If making changes to the release flow etc, you can publish to test.pypi.org when testing. To do this, update the `Publish to PyPI` step with the following:\n```\n    - name: Publish to PyPI\n      id: publish-to-pypi\n      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1\n      with:\n        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN_TEST }}\n        repository_url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n```\n- That will publish packages to https://test.pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/ instead, without updating the index of the main PyPI repo.\n- Don't forget to change it back when you're done!\n\n# Usage\nEither of the following options will install the funding-service-design-utils into your python project. The package `fsd_utils` can then be imported.\n## Released version\nTo reference a particular tag from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install` (update version as appropriate):\n\n    funding-service-design-utils==0.0.1\n\n## Latest / in-dev version\nTo reference the latest commit from a particular branch from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install`:\n\n    git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-utils.git@<branchName>\n\n## Local changes\nWhen working and testing locally, you can also install the `fsd_utils` package from your local filesystem:\n\n    pip uninstall -y funding-service-design-utils\n    pip install /path/to/your/working/directory/funding-service-design/utils\n\nNote: When testing locally using the docker runner, docker might use the cached version of fsd_utils. to avoid this and pick up your intended changes, run `docker compose build <service_name> --no-cache` first before running `docker compose up`.\n\n# Utilities\n\n## The configclass\nCurrently the configclass allows for pretty print debugging of config keys and the class from which they are created. This allows devs to quickly diagnoise problems arrising from incorrectly set config. To activate this functionality, one must decorate each config class with the `@configclass` decorator.\n\n## Common Config\nThis defines config values that are common across different services, eg. url patterns. Usage example:\n\n```\nfrom fsd_utils import CommonConfig\n\n@configclass\nclass DefaultConfig:\n    SECRET_KEY = CommonConfig.SECRET_KEY\n\n```\n\nThis also defines a function `get_default_round_id` to determine the current default round ID based on the current date and the opening date of COF_R2_W3. The opening dates are determined by the fund store.\n\n## Gunicorn\nThe gunicorn utility allows consistent configuration of gunicorn across microservices.\n\nTo use it,\nFirst - add run/gunicorn directory in your application with config scripts that import the appropriate config from this util's choice of config files eg.\n\n    # in run/gunicorn/local.py\n    from fsd_utils.gunicorn.config.local import *  # noqa\n\nThen - add a wsgi.py script to the root of your application eg.\n\n    # in wsgi.py\n    from app import app\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run()\n\nFinally - To run with gunicorn, call the gunicorn command in your manifest.yml's or in the terminal, passing the wsgi application and the appropriate configuration file as arguments eg.\n\nin the terminal:\n\n    gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/dev.py\n\nin a manifest file:\n\n    # manifest-dev.yml\n    ---\n    applications:\n        ...\n        command: gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/devtest.py\n\n## Logging\nThe logging utility formats logs to a consistent format (text in development and json in other environments).\nThe utility also supports logging from gunicorn\n\nTo use it add the following to your flask create_app factory\n\n    from fsd_utils.logging import logging\n\n    def create_app():\n        ...\n        # Initialise logging\n        logging.init_app(flask_app)\n\nand in your env config classes, specify the log level you want to report eg.:\n\n    @configclass\n    class DefaultConfig(object):\n        ...\n        # Logging\n        FSD_LOG_LEVEL = logging.WARNING\n\n## Authentication\nThe authentication utility provides a consistent authentication functions including a `@login_required` decorator that can be used to restrict routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users.\n\nTo use the utility:\nFirst - ensure that the following environment variables are set to the appropriate values eg.:\n\n    FSD_USER_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME = \"fsd_user_token\"\n    AUTHENTICATOR_HOST = \"https://funding-service-design-authenticator-dev.london.cloudapps.digital\"\n    RSA256_PUBLIC_KEY = \"{RSA PUBLIC KEY}\"\n\nNOTE: These values (and keys) need to be shared/common across all microservices that use each common authenticator host. If any of the environment *keys* for each of these attributes needs to be modified these can be reconfigured in fsd_utils/authentication/config.py.\n\nThen - to use the `@login_required` decorator just add it to routes you need to protect eg:\n\n    # in ...routes.py\n    from fsd_utils.authentication.decorators import login_required\n\n    @login_required\n    def example_route(account_id):\n        #...account_id will be available here if the user is authenticated\n        #...if not logged in the user will be redirected to re-authenticate\n\n## Healthchecks\nAdds the route `/healthcheck` to an application. On hitting this endpoint, a customisable set of checks are run to confirm the application is functioning as expected and a JSON response is returned.\n\nResponse codes:\n- 200: All checks were successful, application is healthy\n- 500: One or more checks failed, application is unhealthy\n\nExample usage:\n```\nfrom fsd_utils.healthchecks.healthcheck import Healthcheck\nfrom fsd_utils.healthchecks.checkers import DbChecker, FlaskRunningChecker\n\nhealth = Healthcheck(flask_app)\nhealth.add_check(FlaskRunningChecker())\nhealth.add_check(DbChecker(db))\n```\nThe above will initialise the `/healthcheck` url and adds 2 checks.\n\n### Checks\nThe following 2 checks are provided in `fsd_utils` in `checkers.py`:\n- `FlaskRunningChecker`: Checks whether a `current_app` is available from flask, returns `True` if it is, `False` if not.\n- `DbChecker`: Runs a simple query against the DB to confirm database availability.\n\n### Implementing custom checks\nCustom checks can be created as subclasses of `CheckerInterface` and should contain a method with the following signature:\n`def check(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:`\nWhere\n- `bool` is a True or False whether the check was successful\n- `str` is a message to display in the result JSON, typically `OK` or `Fail`\n\n## Translations\nMultiple language support is provided by `flask-babel`. Docs here: https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel/#\n\n### Python Setup\nThe python setup relies on 2 methods and an initialisation. In `create_app` we initialise `babel` on our app:\n\n    from fsd_utils.locale_selector.get_lang import get_lang\n\n    babel = Babel(flask_app)\n    babel.locale_selector_func = get_lang\n    LanguageSelector(flask_app)\n\nThe `get_lang()` function reads the user-selected language from a cookie (if set by `LanguageSelector` - see below), or if that is not present uses a built-in function of babel to negotiate the language based on the request headers and the supported languages.\n\n`LanguageSelector` creates an additional route `/language/<language>` that sets the user's selected language in a cookie. Used the cookie rather than the session so it can be shared across the microservices.\n\nSet `COOKIE_DOMAIN` on the app to the domain you want to set the cookie on.\n\n### Creating Translations\n1. Add `trans` tags around items in your jinja html file that you want to translate. What's contained in the `trans` tag should be the english version of this text. eg:\n\n        A greeting is: {% trans %}Good Morning{% endtrans %}\n\n1. Generate a new translations template file (`messages.pot`)\n\n        pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .\n\n1. If initialising a new set of translations for a new repo or adding a new language, use `init`. *This will override any changes already made in the `translations` directory!*\n\n        # Initialise a welsh translations file in app/translations\n        pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l cy\n    The directory supplied to `-d` (eg. `app/translations`) must sit at the same level as the `templates` folder, in our case within the `app` directory. This command generates a new `messages.po` file in `translations/cy/LC_MESSAGES/` Where `cy` is the language code. (cy = Welsh/Cymraeg)\n\n1. If you've added new strings to an existing template, or added new templates after running `init`, use `update`:\n\n        pybabel update -i messages.pot -d app/translations\n\n    This will append new strings to the existing `messages.po` file, preserving any translations you already have in there.\n\n1. To add translations for strings, edit the `messages.po` file.\n\n        #: app/templates/index.html:10\n        msgid \"Good Morning\"\n        msgstr \"Bore da\"\n\n    where `msgid` is the english version of the string from the original template file, and `msgstr` is the translation of the string.\n\n1. Once the translations are ready, use `compile` to generate the binary for use at runtime:\n\n        pybabel compile -d app/translations\n\n## Sentry\nEnables Sentry integration.\n\n* Before the flask app is created initialise Sentry using\n```\nfrom fsd_utils import init_sentry\n\ninit_sentry()\n```\n* Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on the app\n\n## Simple Utils\nFolder to hold miscellaneous simple utilities.\n\n### date_utils\nDate comparison functions that accept an ISO Format string, for use in the frontend determining display logic based on dates.\n\n## Fixtures\nContains shared fixtures that can be used for unit tests in other repos. To include a fixture from `fsd_utils` in your project, add the following to your `conftest.py`:\n\n    pytest_plugins = [\"fsd_test_utils.fixtures.db_fixtures\"]\n\nWhere the part inside `[]` is the paths to the python files you want to load as fixtures.\n\n### DB_Fixtures\n\nIndividual fixtures are explained below, but this is the general expected usage. In the `conftest.py` of your repo, define a fixture that will seed the database with the test data you require and make those records avaialble to tests. That fixture should request `clear_test_data` and `enable_preserve_test_data` to prevent test pollution and ensure a suitable database is available for tests. The tests themselves should only update data that is inserted by that fixture. Examples:\n\n1. Basic Usage\n\n    In conftest.py\n\n        @pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")\n        def create_test_data(clear_test_data, enable_preserve_test_data):\n            # Logic to insert some test data\n            created_data = [all_created_data]\n\n            yield created_data\n\n            # No teardown logic required as this is covered in clear_test_data\n\n    In your test file\n\n        def test_get_data(create_test_data):\n            id = create_test_data[0].id\n            record = get_record_using_api_under_test(id)\n            assert record.id == id\n\n1. If your tests need to directly manipulate the database, use the `_db` fixture:\n\n        def test_after_update(create_test_data, _db):\n            id = create_test_data[0].id\n            record = get_record(id)\n            record.name = \"new name\"\n\n            _db.session.add(record)\n            _db.session.commit()\n\n            # Do some further tests post update\n\n1. If you want to be able to inspect the database after running a test:\n\n        @pytest.mark.preserve_test_data(True)\n        def test_get_data(create_test_data):\n            id = create_test_data[0].id\n            record = get_record_using_api_under_test(id)\n            assert record.id == id\n\n    After the test runs, any created data will still be there for manual inspection. It will then be removed at the start of the next test run.\n\n#### clear_test_data\nThis fixture is module scoped so at the end of each test file all data is removed from the database (providing `preserve_test_data` is not set - see below.) Helps to prevent test pollution.\n#### enable_preserve_test_data\nThis fixture looks for the marker `pytest.mark.preserve_test_data(True)` and if found, test data is not cleared at the end of the test session, allowing you to manually inspect the database to aid debugging.\n\n**Note**: Not intended to be used as a default for tests as it can lead to test pollution, so only use to debug and then remove again.\n#### _db\nProvides direct access to the database for tests. Useful if your test needs to explicitly insert/update records to prepare test data.\n#### recreate_db\nThis fixture reads the pytest cache to determine whether the DB can be reused for this test run and then the db is recreated accordingly. Updates the cache value to enable reuse of the DB for future test runs. This is session scoped so the DB is not recreated for each test in a run.\n\nThis is requested by `clear_test_data` so you do not need to include it separately in your project if using that fixture.\n",
