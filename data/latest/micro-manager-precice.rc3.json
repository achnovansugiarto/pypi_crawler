    "description": "# Micro Manager\n\nA Manager tool to facilitate solving two-scale (macro-micro) coupled problems using the coupling library [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice).\n\n## Installing the Micro Manager\n\n### Option 1: Using pip\n\nIt is recommended to install [micro-manager-precice from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/micro-manager-precice/) by running\n\n```bash\npip install --user micro-manager-precice\n```\n\nIf the dependencies are not installed, then `pip` will attempt to install them for you. If you encounter problems in the direct installation, see the [dependencies section](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager#required-dependencies) below for links to installation procedures of all dependencies.\n\n### Option 2: Clone this repository and install manually\n\n#### Required dependencies\n\nEnsure that the following dependencies are installed:\n\n* Python 3 or higher\n* [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki)\n* [pyprecice: Python language bindings for preCICE](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings)\n* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)\n* [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)\n\n#### Build and install the Manager using pip\n\nAfter cloning this repository, go to the project directory `micro-manager` and run `pip3 install --user .`.\n\n#### Build and install the Manager using Python\n\nAfter cloning this repository, go to the project directory `micro-manager` and run `python setup.py install --user`.\n\n## Using the Micro Manager\n\nThe Micro Manager facilitates two-scale coupling between one macro-scale simulation and many micro-scale simulations. It creates instances of several micro simulations and couples them to one macro simulation, using preCICE. An existing micro simulation code written in Python needs to be converted into a library with a specific class name and specific function names. The next section describes the required library structure of the micro simulation code. On the other hand, the micro-problem is coupled to preCICE directly. The section [couple your code](https://precice.org/couple-your-code-overview.html) of the preCICE documentation gives more details on coupling existing codes.\n\n### Steps to convert micro simulation code to a callable library\n\n* Create a class called `MicroSimulation`. It is good practice to define class member variables in the class constructor `__init__`. The constructor of the class `MicroSimulation` gets an integer value from the Micro Manager which is the ID of the micro simulation from the perspective of the Micro Manager. This ID can be used later on for writing output.\n* **Optional**: Define a function `initialize` which computes the initial state of the micro simulation and returns initial values, which need to be transferred to the macro simulation. The return value needs to be a Python dictionary with the names of the quantities as keys and the values of the quantities as the dictionary values.\n* Create a function `solve`, which consists of all solving steps of one time step of a micro simulation or, if the micro problem is a steady-state simulation, all solving steps until the steady state is reached. `solve` should take a Python dictionary as an input, which has the name of the input data as keys and the corresponding data values as values. The `solve` function should return the quantities that need to be communicated to the macro-side. The return entity needs to again be a Python dictionary with the names of the quantities as keys and the values of the quantities as values.\n* If implicit coupling is required between the macro and all micro problems, then you can additionally define two functions `save_checkpoint` and `revert_to_checkpoint`.\n  * `save_checkpoint` should save the current state of the micro problem.\n  * `revert_to_checkpoint` should revert to the saved state (required if the coupling loop does not convergence after a time step).\n* **Optional**: Define a function `output` which writes the micro simulation output. The micro Manager will call this function with the frequency set by the configuration option `simulation_params: micro_output_n`.\n\nAn example of a MicroSimulation class as used in `/examples/macro-micro-dummy`:\n\n```python\nclass MicroSimulation:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructor of MicroSimulation class.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._dims = 3\n        self._micro_scalar_data = None\n        self._micro_vector_data = None\n        self._checkpoint = None\n\n    def initialize(self):\n        self._micro_scalar_data = 0\n        self._micro_vector_data = []\n        self._checkpoint = 0\n\n    def solve(self, macro_data, dt):\n        assert dt != 0\n        self._micro_vector_data = []\n        self._micro_scalar_data = macro_data[\"macro-scalar-data\"]\n        for d in range(self._dims):\n            self._micro_vector_data.append(macro_data[\"macro-vector-data\"][d])\n\n        return {\"micro-scalar-data\": self._micro_scalar_data.copy(),\n                \"micro-vector-data\": self._micro_vector_data.copy()}\n\n    def save_checkpoint(self):\n        print(\"Saving state of micro problem\")\n        self._checkpoint = self._micro_scalar_data\n\n    def reload_checkpoint(self):\n        print(\"Reverting to old state of micro problem\")\n        self._micro_scalar_data = self._checkpoint\n\n    def output(self):\n        print(\"Writing VTK output of micro problem\")\n        self._write_vtk()\n```\n\n### Configuring the Micro Manager\n\nThe Micro Manager is configured at runtime using a JSON file `micro-manager-config.json`. An example configuration file is:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"micro_file_name\": \"micro_heat\",\n    \"coupling_params\": {\n            \"participant_name\": \"Micro-Manager\",\n            \"config_file_name\": \"precice-config.xml\",\n            \"macro_mesh_name\": \"macro-mesh\",\n            \"write_data_names\": {\"k_00\": \"scalar\", \"k_11\": \"scalar\", \"porosity\": \"scalar\"},\n            \"read_data_names\": {\"concentration\": \"scalar\"}\n    },\n    \"simulation_params\": {\n      \"macro_domain_bounds\": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5],\n      \"micro_output_n\": 5\n    },\n    \"diagnostics\": {\n      \"data_from_micro_sims\": {\"grain_size\": \"scalar\"},\n      \"output_micro_sim_solve_time\": \"True\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe following quantities need to be configured:\n\n* `micro_file`: Path to the micro-simulation script. **Do not add the file extension** `.py`.\n* `coupling_params`:\n  * `precice_config`: Path to the preCICE XML configuration file.\n  * `macro_mesh`: Name of the macro mesh as stated in the preCICE configuration.\n  * `read_data_names`: A Python dictionary with the names of the data to be read from preCICE as keys and `\"scalar\"` or `\"vector\"`  as values.\n  * `write_data_names`: A Python dictionary with the names of the data to be written to preCICE as keys and `\"scalar\"` or `\"vector\"`  as values.\n* `simulation_params`:\n  * `macro_domain_bounds`: Minimum and maximum limits of the macro-domain, having the format `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]`.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned configuration options there are optional choices:\n\n* `simulation_params`:\n  * `micro_output_n`: Frequency of calling the output functionality of the micro simulation in terms of number of time steps. If this quantity is configured the Micro Manager will attempt to call the `output()` function of the micro simulation.\n\nThe Micro Manager is capable of generating diagnostics type output of the micro simulations, which is critical in the development phase of two-scale simulations. The following configuration options are available:\n\n* `diagnostics`:\n  * `data_from_micro_sims`: A Python dictionary with the names of the data from the micro simulation to be written to VTK files as keys and `\"scalar\"` or `\"vector\"`  as values.\n  * `output_micro_sim_solve_time`: When `True`, the Manager writes the wall clock time of the `solve()` function of each micro simulation to the VTK output.\n\n#### Changes to preCICE configuration file\n\nThe Micro Manager relies on the [export functionality](https://precice.org/configuration-export.html#enabling-exporters) of preCICE to write diagnostics data output. If the option `diagnotics: data_from_micro_sims` is configured, the corresponding export tag also needs to be set in the preCICE XML configuration script.\n\n### Running the Micro Manager\n\nThe Micro Manager is run directly from the terminal by providing the configuration file as an input argument in the following way:\n\n```bash\nmicro_manager micro-manager-config.json\n```\n\nAlternatively the Manager can also be run by creating a Python script which imports the Micro Manager package and calls its run function. For example a run script `run-micro-manager.py` would look like:\n\n```python\nfrom micro_manager import MicroManager\n\nmanager = MicroManager(\"micro-manager-config.json\")\n\nmanager.run()\n```\n\nThe script is then run:\n\n```bash\npython run-micro-manager.py\n```\n\nThe Micro Manager can also be run in parallel, using the same script as stated above:\n\n```bash\nmpirun -n <number-of-procs> python3 run-micro-manager.py\n```\n\n### Advanced configuration options\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned configuration options, the Manager offers more options for diagnostics output.\n\nIf the user wants to output the clock time required to solve each micro simulation, They can add the following keyword to the configuration:\n\n```json\n\"diagnostics\": {\n  \"output_micro_sim_solve_time\": \"True\"\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally if the micro simulation code has a function called `output`, the Manager will try to call it in order to generate output of all micro simulations. In this situation, the Manager can be configured to output at a particular interval. This configuration is done as follows:\n\n```json\n\"simulation_params\": {\n  \"micro_output_n\": 10\n}\n```\n\nHere, the Manager will write output of micro simulations every 10 time steps. If the entity `micro_output_n` is not defined, then the Manager will output the micro simulation output in every time step.\n\n### Creating a preCICE configuration file for a macro-micro problem\n\nIn addition to configuring the Micro Manager, preCICE itself also needs to be configured via a [XML configuration file](https://precice.org/configuration-overview.html).\nThe user is expected to configure preCICE with the correct names of the data being exchanged between the macro and micro side. An example of such a macro-micro configuration for preCICE can be found in [this two-scale heat conduction example](https://github.com/IshaanDesai/coupled-heat-conduction).\n",
