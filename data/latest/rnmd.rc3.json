    "description": "# rnmd - markdown execution runtime\n\nRNMD is a mardown execution runtime which can be used to run code contained inside of a markdown file.  \nThe vision behind it is to have your documentation and code together in one place and not maintain\n2 versions of the same code (1 in .md and 1 script file).  \n\nEspecially useful when automatizing things under linux as it is easy to forget what some scripts were for,\nif they do not contain documentation and maintaining the script and a good looking documentation would be too much effort.\n(Especially with the very stripped down syntax of many command line programs this can become a problem)  \n\nIn that regard **rnmd** also has installation features through which to manage these scripts make them optionally executable/runnable\nfrom anywhere on the system. (mainly for automatization)\n\nIt also adds features to easily transport your scripts and documentation to different machines.\nJust make your markdown notebook a git repository and pull your commands to any machine.\nOr just use **rnmd** to run code of markdown files from an online url. (Easily share your code)\n\nCurrently **supported languages** are:\n\n- bash script\n\n**TODOS:**\n\n- Add specific block execution (--> makes it possible to run the samples in this readme)\n- Support more languages (maybe add possibility to specify run command in markdown)\n- Resolve module imports (To write whole programs using rnmd)\n- Resolve paths (it they are for instance relative to the .md script)\n- Improve argparse option handling\n- Namespaces and modules (prevent name conflicts by grouping documents and their backups)\n- Multi Notebook management\n- Windows support (the proxies are right now bash on shell script and therefore not portable -> switch to python3)\n\n## Installation\n\nCan be easily installed from pypi with pip3.\n\n```bash\npip3 install rnmd\n```\n\n## Running from source\n\nYou can also alway clone the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/rnmd) and run rnmd with python.\n\n```bash\npython3 rnmd.py notebook/test.md\n```\n\n## Running code contained in a markdown file\n\nExecute a markdown document using the rnmd markdown execution runtime.  \nThe document location passed to rnmd can currently be:  \n\n1. A file path\n2. An url containing a document\n\n```bash\nrnmd notebook/test.md\n```\n\n## Passing arguments to the runtime\n\n```bash\nrnmd notebook/test.md --args arg1 arg2 arg3\n```\n\nNote: If passing arguments to an installed proxy then the **--args** flag is not required.  \n\n## Using rnmd to make a proxy linking to the specified document\n\nProxies are itermediate bash scripts that link to the document to be run.  \n(They also contain a shebang so you do not need to specify \"bash\" to run the script)  \nBy executing a proxy we are using rnmd to execute our linked document without having to write the command ourselves.  \n\n```bash\n#Make Proxy\nrnmd notebook/test.md --proxy proxy/test\n#Run Proxy\nproxy/test\n```\n\n## Setting up rnmd for installation of proxies\n\nYou can also use rnmd to install proxies to your system.  \nTo use the install feature of rnmd you need to run the setup process once before.  \nDuring this process have to specify a location (your **notebook**) where the proxies and document backups are installed to.  \nAfter this you are asked if you want to add this location to your path (using your shell configuration) making your installed proxies\nexecutable from anywhere on your system by its name.  \n\n```bash\nrnmd --setup\n```\n\n## Installing proxies\n\nInstall a proxy to your document on your system and make the command available from you path.  \n(Requires **rnmd --setup** to have been run)  \nAlso moves a backup copy of your document into your notbook, which can be executed if the main linked document was not found.  \n\n```bash\n#Make and install Proxy\nrnmd notebook/test.md --install test-proxy-install\n#Execute (if in path)\ntest-proxy-install\n```\n\nNote: Installing works for .sh scripts as well, so you can easily install them to your system.\n\n## Proxies\n\nProxies are currently bash scripts with a shebang for easy execution of a linked document using rnmd.\nThe however have other functions included as well:\n1. An included installer: \nIf **rnmd** is not yet installed the script asks the user if he wants to install it on the machine.\nIf yes was selected **rnmd** is installed using **pip3**\nNote: python3 and pip3 are requirements of rnmd.\n2. Running the backed up document instead, if the linked document could not be found (installed proxy only)\n3. Refreshing the document backup, from the linked doc\n4. Running the linked document using **rnmd**\n\n## Making portable installs\n\nIf you want to transport your notebook to another machine you might want to perform a portable install of your documents instead.  \nBy doing this the document you are installing is moved to your notebook and the location inside of your notebook is linked by the proxy instead.  \nThe advantage of this is that you for instance can move you notebook around and to a different machine and the commands will all still work\nas the documents stay inside of the notebook. (for example if you make your notebook a git repo)  \n\n```bash\n#Make and install Proxy\nrnmd notebook/test.md --portableinstall test-portable-proxy-install\n#Execute (if in path)\ntest-portable-proxy-install\n```\n\n## List installed commands of your notebook\n\n```bash\nrnmd --list\nrnmd -l\n```\n\n## Remove/uninstall a command of your notebook\n\n```bash\nrnmd --remove test-portable-proxy-install\n```\n\n## Print the code contained inside of a document\n\n```bash\nrnmd --extract notebook/test.md\n```\n\n## Compile markdown to target location\n\n```bash\nrnmd notebook/test.md --compile compiled/test\n```\n\n## Create backups\n\nCreate a backup of the specified document in the backup dir of your notebook directory.  \n\n```bash\nrnmd --backup notebook/test.md\n```\n\n## Create backups at location\n\nCreate a backup of the specified document in the backup dir of your notebook directory.  \n\"backupto\" path can either be a file path or a directory into which to move the source document.  \nAlso useful for downloading documents to the local machine.  \n\n```bash\nrnmd notebook/test.md --backupto target/test.md\n```\n\n## Check if the specified document exists\n\n```bash\nrnmd --check notebook/test.md\n```\n\n## Licence notes\n\nThe choice for using LGPL 2.1 is strategic so if i may stop developing the runtime\nit will still receive bugfixes/improvements from entities using this software in their programs.  \n\nAs you could build whole programs based on the rn_md runtime (markdown -> script) interpreter\nthe GPL licence is not the way to go as it probably would make those programs GPL as well,\nwhich in turn hurts adoption of this project as it would pretty much restrict its\nusage to GPL programs only.  \n\nBecause of these reasons the LGPL2.1 Licence was chosen.  \n\n### If you like the project consider dropping me a coffee\n\n[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=BSFX8LCPHW2AE)\n\n<br>  \n<br>\n\n",
