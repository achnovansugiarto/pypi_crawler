In particular, PASEOS offers the user some utilities to run their own [activities](#activity) by taking into account both operational and onboard (e.g. limited-power-budget, radiation, and thermal effects) constraints. <br> PASEOS is designed to be:\n\n- **open-source**: the source code of PASEOS is available under a GPL license.\n- **fully decentralised**: one instance of PASEOS shall be executed in every node, i.e. individual spacecraft (actor), of the emulated spacecraft. Each instance of PASEOS is responsible for handling the user [activities](#activity) executed on that node (the local actor) while keeping track of the status of the other nodes. In this way, the design of PASEOS is completely decentralised and independent of the number of nodes of the constellation. Because of that, both single-node and multi-node scenarios are possible.\n- **application-agnostic**: each user operation that has to be executed on a node is modelled as an [activity](#activity). The user is only required to provide the code to run and some parameters (e.g., power consumption) for each [activity](#activity). Thus, activities can be any code the user wants to simulate running on a spacecraft and thereby PASEOS is completely application-agnostic. Conceivable applications range from modelling constellations to training machine learning methods.\n\n<br> The project is being developed by $\\Phi$[-lab@Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en/data-factory/f-lab-sweden) in the frame of a collaboration between [AI Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en/) and the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) to explore distributed edge learning for space applications. For more information on PASEOS and $\\Phi$-lab@Sweden, please take a look at the recording of the $\\Phi$-lab@Sweden [kick-off event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuFRCcNxLgo&t=2365s).\n\n## PASEOS space environment simulation\n\n![Alt Text](resources/images/PASEOS_constraints.png)\nPASEOS allows simulating the effect of onboard and operational constraints on user-registered [activities](#activity). The image above showcases the different phenomena considered (or to be implemented) in PASEOS.\n\n## Installation\n\n### pip / conda\n\n`conda` support will follow in the near future.\n\nOn Linux you can install via `pip` using\n\n```\n\npip install paseos\n\n```\n\nThis requires `Python 3.8.16` due to [pykep's limited support of pip](https://esa.github.io/pykep/installation.html). \n\nOn Windows / OS X or if you encounter problems, please consider [setting up a dedicated](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) `conda` environment to install dependencies with the provided `environment.yml`\n\n\n### Building from source\n\nFor now, first of all clone the [GitHub](https://github.com/aidotse/PASEOS.git) repository as follows ([Git](https://git-scm.com/) required):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/aidotse/PASEOS.git\n```\n\nTo install PASEOS you can use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) as follows:\n\n```\ncd PASEOS\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\nThis will create a new conda environment called `PASEOS` and install the required software packages.\nTo activate the new environment, you can use:\n\n```\nconda activate paseos\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install PASEOS by using [pip](https://www.pypy.org/) as follows:\n\n```\ncd PASEOS\npip install -e .\n```\n### Using Docker\nTwo [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images are available:\n* [paseos](https://hub.docker.com/r/gabrielemeoni/paseos): corresponding to the latest release.\n* [paseos-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/gabrielemeoni/paseos-nightly): based on the latest commit on the branch `main`. \n\nIf you want to install PASEOS using Docker, access the desired repository and follow the provided instructions. \n\n## Examples\n\nThe next examples will introduce you to the use of PASEOS.\n\nComprehensive, self-contained examples can also be found in the `examples` folder where you can find an example on:\n\n* Modelling and analysing a large constellation with PASEOS\n* Modelling distributed learning on heterogeneous data in a constellation\n* Using PASEOS with MPI to run PASEOS on supercomputers\n* Using PASEOS to model the task of onboard satellite volcanic eruptions detection\n\nThe following are small snippets on specific topics.\n\n### Actors\n\n#### Create a PASEOS actor\n\nThe code snippet below shows how to create a PASEOS [actor](#actor) named **mySat** of type [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor). [pykep](https://esa.github.io/pykep/) is used to define the satellite [epoch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)>) in format [mjd2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day) format. <br>\n[actors](#actor) are created by using an `ActorBuilder`. The latter is used to define the [actor](#actor) `scaffold` that includes the [actor](#actor) minimal properties. In this way, [actors](#actor) are built in a modular fashion that enables their use also for non-space applications.\n\n```py\n\nimport pykep as pk\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\nsat_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n\n```\n\n#### Local and Known Actors\n\nOnce you have instantiated a [PASEOS simulation](#initializing-paseos) to know how to create an instance of PASEOS)), you can add other PASEOS [actors](#actor) ([Known actors](#known-actors)) to the simulation. You can use this, e.g., to facilitate communications between actors and to automatically monitor communication windows.<br>\nThe next code snippet will add both a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) and a [GroundstationActor](#ground-stationactor) (`other_sat`). An orbit is set for `other_sat`, which is placed around Earth at position `(x,y,z)=(-10000,0,0)` and velocity `(vx,vy,vz)=(0,-8000,0)` at epoch `epoch=pk.epoch(0)`.\nThe latter (`grndStation`) will be placed at coordinates `(lat,lon)=(79.002723, 14.642972)` and elevation of 0 m. <br> You cannot add a power device and an orbit to a `GroundstationActor`.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor, GroundstationActor\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Let's set the orbit of local_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       central_body=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n\n# Create another SpacecraftActor\nother_spacraft_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"other_sat\",\n                                      actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                      epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Let's set the orbit of other_spacraft_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=other_spacraft_actor,\n                       position=[-10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, -8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0), central_body=pk.epoch(0))\n\n#Create GroundstationActor\ngrndStation = GroundstationActor(name=\"grndStation\", epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n#Set the ground station at lat lon 79.002723 / 14.642972\n# and its elevation 0m\nActorBuilder.set_ground_station_location(grndStation,\n                                         latitude=79.002723,\n                                         longitude=14.642972,\n                                         elevation=0)\n\n# Adding other_spacraft_actor to PASEOS.\nsim.add_known_actor(other_spacraft_actor)\n\n# Adding grndStation to PASEOS.\nsim.add_known_actor(grndStation)\n```\n\n### Physical Models\n\n#### Set an orbit for a PASEOS SpacecraftActor\n\nOnce you have defined a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor), you can assign a [Keplerian orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_orbit) to it. To this aim, you need to define the central body the [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) is orbiting around and specify its position and velocity (in the central body's [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference)) and an epoch. In this case, we will use `Earth` as a central body.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\nsat_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of sat_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=sat_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0), central_body=earth)\n```\n\n#### How to add a communication device\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to add a communication device to a [SpacecraftActors] (#spacecraftactor). A communication device is needed to model the communication between [SpacecraftActors] (#spacecraftactor) or a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) and [GroundstationActor](#ground-stationactor). Currently, given the maximum transmission data rate of a communication device, PASEOS calculates the maximum data that can be transmitted by multiplying the transmission data rate by the length of the communication window. The latter is calculated by taking the period for which two actors are in line-of-sight into account.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\nsat_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n# Add a communication device\nActorBuilder.add_comm_device(actor=sat_actor,\n                             # Communication device name\n                             device_name=\"my_communication_device\",\n                             # Bandwidth in kbps.\n                             bandwidth_in_kbps=100000)\n```\n\n#### How to add a power device\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to add a power device to a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor).\nMoreover, PASEOS assumes that the battery will be charged by solar panels, which will provide energy thanks to the incoming solar radiation when the spacecraft is not eclipsed. Charging and discharging happens automatically during [activities](#activity).\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\nsat_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n# Add a power device\nActorBuilder.set_power_devices(actor=sat_actor,\n                               battery_level_in_Ws=100, # current level\n                               max_battery_level_in_Ws=2000,\n                               charging_rate_in_W=10,\n                               power_device_type=paseos.PowerDeviceType.SolarPanel)\n```\n\nAlternatively to the default `paseos.PowerDeviceType.SolarPanel` you can also use `paseos.PowerDeviceType.RTG`. The only difference at the moment is that [RTGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) also charge in eclipse.\n\nNote that at the moment only one power device is supported. Adding another will override the existing one.\n\nYou can check the battery's state of charge and level in Ws with:\n\n```py\nprint(my_actor.state_of_charge)\nprint(my_actor.battery_level_in_Ws)\n```\n\n#### Thermal Modelling\n\nTo model thermal constraints on spacecraft we utilize a model inspired by the one-node model described in [Martínez - Spacecraft Thermal Modelling and Test](http://imartinez.etsiae.upm.es/~isidoro/tc3/Spacecraft%20Thermal%20Modelling%20and%20Testing.pdf). Thus, we model the change in temperature as\n\n$$mc \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{solar} + \\dot{Q}_{albedo} + \\dot{Q}_{central_body_IR} - \\dot{Q}_{dissipated} + \\dot{Q}_{activity}.$$\n\nThis means your spacecraft will heat up due to being in sunlight, albedo reflections, infrared radiation emitted by the central body as well as due to power consumption of activities. It will cool down due to heat dissipation.\n\nThe model is only available for a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) and (like all the physical models) only evaluated for the [local actor](#local-actor).\n\nThe following parameters have to be specified for this:\n\n- Spacecraft mass [kg], initial temperature [K], emissive area (for heat disspiation) and thermal capacity [J / (kg * K)]\n- Spacecraft absorptance of Sun light, infrared light. [0 to 1]\n- Spacecraft area [m^2] facing Sun and central body, respectively\n- Solar irradiance in this orbit [W] (defaults to 1360W)\n- Central body surface temperature [k] (defaults to 288K)\n- Central body emissivity and reflectance [0 to 1] (defaults to 0.6 and 0.3)\n- Ratio of power converted to heat (defaults to 0.5)\n\nTo use it, simply equip your [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) with a thermal model with:\n\n```py\nfrom paseos import SpacecraftActor, ActorBuilder\nmy_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(\"my_actor\", SpacecraftActor, pk.epoch(0))\nActorBuilder.set_thermal_model(\n    actor=my_actor,\n    actor_mass=50.0, # Setting mass to 50kg\n    actor_initial_temperature_in_K=273.15, # Setting initialtemperature to 0°C\n    actor_sun_absorptance=1.0, # Depending on material, define absorptance\n    actor_infrared_absorptance=1.0, # Depending on material, define absorptance\n    actor_sun_facing_area=1.0, # Area in m2\n    actor_central_body_facing_area=1.0, # Area in m2\n    actor_emissive_area=1.0, # Area in m2\n    actor_thermal_capacity=1000, # Capacity in J / (kg * K)\n    # ... leaving out default valued parameters, see docs for details\n)\n```\n\nThe model is evaluated automatically during [activities](#activity). You can check the spacecraft temperature with:\n\n```py\nprint(my_actor.temperature_in_K)\n```\n\nAt the moment, only one thermal model per actor is supported. Setting a second will override the old one.\n\n#### Radiation Modelling\nPASEOS models three types of radiation effects.\n1. Data corruption due to single event upsets which a event rate $r_d$.\n2. Unexpected software faults leading to a random interruption of [activities](#activity) with a Poisson-distributed event rate $r_i$ per second\n3. Device failures with a Poisson-distributed event rate $r_f$ per second, which can be imputed mostly to single event latch-ups\n\nYou can add a radiation model affecting the operations of the devices you are interested in with\n\n```py\n    from paseos import SpacecraftActor, ActorBuilder\n    my_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(\"my_actor\", SpacecraftActor, pk.epoch(0))\n    ActorBuilder.set_radiation_model(\n        actor=my_actor,\n        data_corruption_events_per_s=r_d,\n        restart_events_per_s=r_i,\n        failure_events_per_s=r_f,\n    )\n```\n\nYou can set any of the event rates to 0 to disable that part. Only [SpacecraftActors](#spacecraftactor) support radiation models. You can find out if your actor has failed with\n\n```py\nmy_actor.is_dead\n```\n\nInterrupted [activities](#activity) will return as if a [constraint function](#constraint-function) was no longer satisfied.\n\nTo get a binary mask to model data corruption on the [local actor](#local-actor) you can call\n\n```py\nmask = paseos_instance.model_data_corruption(data_shape=your_data_shape,\n                                             exposure_time_in_s=your_time)\n```\n\n### Simulation Settings\n\n#### Initializing PASEOS\n\nWe will now show how to create an instance of PASEOS. An instance of PASEOS shall be bounded to one PASEOS [actor](#actor) that we call [local actor](#local-actor). Please, notice that an orbit shall be placed for a [SpacecraftActor](#spacecraftactor) before being added to a PASEOS instance. <br>\n\n#### How to instantiate PASEOS\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of local_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       central_body=earth)\n\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n```\n\nFor each actor you wish to model, you can create a PASEOS instance. Running multiple instances on the same machine / thread is supported.\n\n#### Using the cfg\n\nWhen you instantiate PASEOS as shown in [Initializing PASEOS](#initializing-paseos), a PASEOS instance is created by using the default configuration. However, sometimes it is useful to use a custom configuration.\n\nThe next code snippet will show how to start the PASEOS simulation with a time different from `pk.epoch(0)` (MJD2000) by loading a custom configuration.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n\n#Define today as pykep epoch (16-06-22)\n#please, refer to https://esa.github.io/pykep/documentation/core.html#pykep.epoch\ntoday = pk.epoch_from_string('2022-06-16 00:00:00.000')\n\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\n# pk.epoch is set to today\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=today)\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of local_actor.\n# pk.epoch is set to today\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=today,\n                       central_body=earth)\n\n# Loading cfg to modify defaults\ncfg=load_default_cfg()\n# Set simulation starting time by converting epoch to seconds\ncfg.sim.start_time=today.mjd2000 * pk.DAY2SEC\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n```\n\nYou can access the current simulation time (seconds since the start) and the current epoch like this:\n\n```py\ntime_since_start_in_s = sim.simulation_time\ncurrent_epoch = sim.local_time\n```\n\n#### Faster than real-time execution\n\nIn some cases, you may be interested to simulate your spacecraft operating for an extended period. By default, PASEOS operates in real-time, thus this would take a lot of time. However, you can increase the rate of time passing (i.e. the spacecraft moving, power being charged / consumed etc.) using the `time_multiplier` parameter. Set it as follows when initializing PASEOS.\n\n```py\n\ncfg = load_default_cfg() # loading cfg to modify defaults\ncfg.sim.time_multiplier = 10 # setting the parameter so that in 1s real time, paseos models 10s having passed\npaseos_instance = paseos.init_sim(my_local_actor, cfg) # initialize paseos instance\n\n```\n\n#### Event-based mode\n\nAlternatively, you can rely on an event-based mode where PASEOS will simulate the physical constraints for an amount of time. The below code shows how to run PASEOS for a fixed amount of time or until an event interrupts it.\n\n```py\n    import pykep as pk\n    import paseos\n    from paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\n\n    # Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\n    earth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n    # Define a satellite with some orbit and simple power model\n    my_sat = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(\"MySat\", SpacecraftActor, pk.epoch(0))\n    ActorBuilder.set_orbit(sat1, [10000000, 0, 0], [0, 8000.0, 0], pk.epoch(0), earth)\n    ActorBuilder.set_power_devices(sat1, 500, 1000, 1)\n\n    # Abort when sat is at 10% battery\n    def constraint_func():\n        return sat1.state_of_charge > 0.1\n\n    # Set some settings to control evaluation of the constraint\n    cfg = load_default_cfg()  # loading cfg to modify defaults\n    cfg.sim.dt = 0.1  # setting timestep of physical models (power, thermal, ...)\n    cfg.sim.activity_timestep = 1.0  # how often constraint func is evaluated\n    sim = paseos.init_sim(sat1, cfg) # Init simulation\n\n    # Advance for a long time, will interrupt much sooner due to constraint function\n    sim.advance_time(3600, 10, constraint_function=constraint_func)\n```\n\n### Activities\n\n#### Simple activity\n\nPASEOS enables the user to register their [activities](#activity) that will be executed on the `local actor`. This is an alternative to the [event-based mode](#event-based-mode)\n\nTo register an activity, it is first necessary to define an asynchronous [activity function](#activity-function). The following code snippet shows how to create a simple [activity function](#activity-function) `activity_function_A` that prints \"Hello Universe!\". Then, it waits for 0.1 s before concluding the activity. <br> When you register an [activity](#activity), you need to specify the power consumption associated to the activity.\n\n```py\n#Activity function\nasync def activity_function_A(args):\n  print(\"Hello Universe!\")\n  await asyncio.sleep(0.1) #Await is needed inside an async function.\n```\n\nOnce an activity is registered, the user shall call `perform_activity(...)` to run the registered activity.\nThe next snippet will showcase how to register and perform the activity `activity_A`. <br>\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\nimport asyncio\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of sat_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       central_body=earth)\n\n# Add a power device\nActorBuilder.set_power_devices(actor=local_actor,\n                               # Battery level at the start of the simulation in Ws\n                               battery_level_in_Ws=100,\n                               # Max battery level in Ws\n                               max_battery_level_in_Ws=2000,\n                               # Charging rate in W\n                               charging_rate_in_W=10)\n\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n\n#Activity function\nasync def activity_function_A(args):\n  print(\"Hello Universe!\")\n  await asyncio.sleep(0.1) #Await is needed inside an async function.\n\n# Register an activity that emulate event detection\nsim.register_activity(\n    \"activity_A\",\n    activity_function=activity_function_A,\n    power_consumption_in_watt=10\n)\n\n#Run the activity\nsim.perform_activity(\"activity_A\")\n```\n\n##### Waiting for Activities to Finish\n\nAt the moment, parallel running of multiple activities is not supported.\nHowever, if you want to run multiple activities in a row or just wait for the existing one to finish, you can use\n\n```py\nawait sim.wait_for_activity()\n```\n\nto wait until the running activity has finished.\n\n#### Activities with Inputs and Outputs\n\nThe next code snippet will show how to register and perform activities with inputs and outputs. In particular, we will register an [activity function](#activity-function) `activity_function_with_in_and_outs` that takes an input argument and returns its value multiplied by two. Then, it waits for 0.1 s before concluding the activity. <br>\nPlease, notice that the output value is placed in `args[1][0]`, which is returned as reference.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\nimport asyncio\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of sat_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       entral_body=earth)\n\n# Add a power device\nActorBuilder.set_power_devices(actor=local_actor,\n                               # Battery level at the start of the simulation in Ws\n                               battery_level_in_Ws=100,\n                               # Max battery level in Ws\n                               max_battery_level_in_Ws=2000,\n                               # Charging rate in W\n                               charging_rate_in_W=10)\n\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n\n#Activity function\nasync def activity_function_with_in_and_outs(args):\n  activity_in=args[0]\n  activity_out=activity_in * 2\n  args[1][0]=activity_out\n  await asyncio.sleep(0.1) #Await is needed inside an async function.\n\n# Register an activity that emulate event detection\nsim.register_activity(\n    \"my_activity\",\n    activity_function=activity_function_with_in_and_outs,\n    power_consumption_in_watt=10,\n)\n\n#Creatie an input variable for activity\nactivity_in=1\n\n#Create a placeholder variable to contain the output of the activity function.\n#It is created as a list so its first value is edited\n# as reference by the activity function.\nactivity_out=[None]\n\n#Run the activity\nsim.perform_activity(\"my_activity\",\n                      activity_func_args=[activity_in, activity_out],\n                    )\n#Print return value\nprint(\"The output of the activity function is: \", activity_out[0])\n```\n\n#### Constraint Function\n\nIt is possible to associate a [constraint function](#constraint-function) with each [activity](#activity) to ensure that some particular constraints are met during the [activity](#activity) execution. When constraints are not met, the activity is interrupted. Constraints can be used, e.g., to impose power requirements, communication windows or maximum operational temperatures. <br>\nThe next code snippet shows how to:\n\n- create a [constraint function](#constraint-function) (`constraint_function_A`) which returns `True` when the local actor's temperature is below ~86°C and `False` otherwise (this requires a thermal model on the actor)\n- how use `constraint_function_A` to constraint our [Simple Activity](#simple-activity).\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\nimport asyncio\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of sat_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       central_body=earth)\n\n# Add a power device\nActorBuilder.set_power_devices(actor=local_actor,\n                               # Battery level at the start of the simulation in Ws\n                               battery_level_in_Ws=100,\n                               # Max battery level in Ws\n                               max_battery_level_in_Ws=2000,\n                               # Charging rate in W\n                               charging_rate_in_W=10)\n\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n\n#Activity function\nasync def activity_function_A(args):\n  print(\"Hello Universe!\")\n  await asyncio.sleep(0.1) #Await is needed inside an async function.\n\n#Constraint function\nasync def constraint_function_A(args):\n  local_actor_temperature=args[0]\n  return (local_actor_temperature < 350)\n\n# Register an activity that emulate event detection\nsim.register_activity(\n    \"activity_A_with_constraint\",\n    activity_function=activity_function_A,\n    power_consumption_in_watt=10,\n    constraint_function=constraint_function_A\n)\n\n#The constraint function is related to the operational temperature of the local actor.\noperational_temperature_in_K=local_actor.temperature_in_K\n\n#Run the activity\nsim.perform_activity(\"activity_A_with_constraint\",\n                      constraint_func_args=[operational_temperature_in_K],\n                    )\n```\n\n#### On-termination Function\n\nIt is also possible to define an [on-termination function](#on-termination-function) to perform some specific operations when on termination of the [activity](#activity). The next code snippet shows:\n\n- how to create an [on-termination function](#on-termination-function) that prints \"activity (activity_A_with_termination_function) ended.\".\n- How to associate our [on-termination function](#on-termination-function) to our [Simple Activity](#simple-activity).\n\nThe name of the [activity](#activity) is passed as input to the [on-termination function](#on-termination-function) to showcase to handle [on-termination function](#on-termination-function) inputs.\n\n```py\nimport pykep as pk\nimport paseos\nfrom paseos import ActorBuilder, SpacecraftActor\nimport asyncio\n# Define an actor of type SpacecraftActor of name mySat\n# (that will be the local actor)\nlocal_actor = ActorBuilder.get_actor_scaffold(name=\"mySat\",\n                                       actor_type=SpacecraftActor,\n                                       epoch=pk.epoch(0))\n\n# Define the central body as Earth by using pykep APIs.\nearth = pk.planet.jpl_lp(\"earth\")\n\n# Let's set the orbit of sat_actor.\nActorBuilder.set_orbit(actor=local_actor,\n                       position=[10000000, 0, 0],\n                       velocity=[0, 8000.0, 0],\n                       epoch=pk.epoch(0),\n                       central_body=earth)\n\n# Add a power device\nActorBuilder.set_power_devices(actor=local_actor,\n                               # Battery level at the start of the simulation in Ws\n                               battery_level_in_Ws=100,\n                               # Max battery level in Ws\n                               max_battery_level_in_Ws=2000,\n                               # Charging rate in W\n                               charging_rate_in_W=10)\n\n# initialize PASEOS simulation\nsim = paseos.init_sim(local_actor)\n\n#Activity function\nasync def activity_function_A(args):\n  print(\"Hello Universe!\")\n  await asyncio.sleep(0.1) #Await is needed inside an async function.\n\n#On-termination function\nasync def on_termination_function_A(args):\n  #Fetching input\n  activity_name=args[0]\n  print(\"Activity (\"+str(activity_name)+\") ended.\")\n\n# Register an activity that emulate event detection\nsim.register_activity(\n    \"activity_A_with_termination_function\",\n    activity_function=activity_function_A,\n    power_consumption_in_watt=10,\n    on_termination_function=on_termination_function_A\n)\n\n#The termination function input is the activity name\nactivity_name=\"activity_A_with_termination_function\"\n\n#Run the activity\nsim.perform_activity(\"activity_A_with_termination_function\",\n                      termination_func_args=[activity_name],\n                    )\n```\n\n### Utilities\n\n#### Visualization\n\nNavigate to paseos/visualization to find a jupyter notebook containing examples of how to visualize PASEOS.\nVisualization can be done in interactive mode or as an animation that is saved to your disc.\nIn the figure below, Earth is visualized in the centre as a blue sphere with different spacecraft in orbit.\nEach spacecraft has a name and if provided, a battery level and a communications device.\nThe local device is illustrated with white text.\nIn the upper-right corner, the status of the communication link between each spacecraft is shown.\nFinally, the time in the lower left and lower right corners corresponds to the epoch and the PASEOS local simulation time.\n\n![Alt Text](resources/images/animation.png)\n\n#### Monitoring Simulation Status\n\nYou can easily track the status of a PASEOS simulation via the `monitor` which keeps track of actor status.\n\nIt allows access like this\n\n```py\n(...) # actor definition etc., see above\ninstance = paseos.init_sim(local_actor=my_local_actor)\n\n(...) # running the simulation\n\n# access tracked parameters\ntimesteps = instance.monitor[\"timesteps\"]\nstate_of_charge = instance.monitor[\"state_of_charge\"]\n```\n\n#### Writing Simulation Results to a File\n\nTo evaluate your results, you will likely want to track the operational parameters, such as actor battery status, currently running activitiy etc. of actors over the course of your simulation. By default, PASEOS will log the current actor status every 10 seconds, however you can change that rate by editing the default configuration, as explained in [How to use the cfg](#how-to-use-the-cfg). You can save the current log to a \\*.csv file at any point.\n\n```py\ncfg = load_default_cfg() # loading cfg to modify defaults\ncfg.io.logging_interval = 0.25  # log every 0.25 seconds\npaseos_instance = paseos.init_sim(my_local_actor, cfg) # initialize paseos instance\n\n# Performing activities, running the simulation (...)\n\npaseos_instance.save_status_log_csv(\"output.csv\")\n```\n\n## System Design of PASEOS\n\n![Alt Text](resources/images/datastructure.svg)\n![Alt Text](resources/images/flowchart.svg)\n\n## Glossary\n\n- ### Activity\n\n  Activity is the abstraction that PASEOS uses to keep track of specific actions performed by an [actor](#actor) upon a request from the user. >PASEOS is responsible for the execution of the activity and for updating the system status depending on the effects of the activity (e.g., by discharging the satellite battery).<br>\n  When registering an activity, the user can specify a [constraint function](#constraint-function) to specify constraints to be met during the execution of the activity and an [on-termination](#on-termination) function to specify additional operations to be performed by PASEOS on termination of the activity function.\n\n- ### Activity function\n\n  User-defined function emulating any operation to be executed in a PASEOS by an [actor](#actor). Activity functions are necessary to register [activities](#activity). Activity functions might include data transmission, housekeeping operations, onboard data acquisition and processing, and others.\n\n- ### Actor\n\n  Since PASEOS is fully-decentralised, each node of a PASEOS constellation shall run an instance of PASEOS modelling all the nodes of that constellation. The abstraction of a constellation node inside a PASEOS instance is a PASEOS `actor`.\n\n- ### Constraint function\n\n  A constraint function is an asynchronous function that can be used by the PASEOS user to specify some constraints that shall be met during the execution of an activity.\n\n- ### GroundstationActor\n\n  `PASEOS actor` emulating a ground station.\n\n- ### Local actor\n\n  The `local actor` is the `actor` whose behaviour is modelled by the locally running PASEOS instance.\n\n- ### Known actors\n\n  In a PASEOS instance, `known actors` are all the other actors that are known to the [local actor](#local-actor).\n\n- ### On-termination function\n\n  An on-termination function is an asynchronous function that can be used by the PASEOS user to specify some operations to be executed on termination of the predefined PASEOS user's activity.\n\n- ### SpacecraftActor\n  PASEOS [actor](#actor) emulating a spacecraft or a satellite.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe `PASEOS` project is open to contributions.
