The `lcopt-dev` conda package is updated each time an update is pushed to the [`development` branch on github](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/tree/development).\n\nIt's recommended that you create a new environment separate from the one with `lcopt` in to install `lcopt-dev`, as they will overwrite one another.\n\nCreate and activate a dev environment at the command line/terminal like this\n\n```\nconda create -y -n lcopt-dev -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c haasad -c pjamesjoyce lcopt-dev\nactivate lcopt-dev    # Note, use \"source activate lcopt-dev\" on Unix\n```\n\nOr to get the most up to date version of `lcopt-dev` in your existing environment:\n\n```\nactivate lcopt-dev    # Note, use \"source activate lcopt-dev\" on Unix\nconda update -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c haasad -c pjamesjoyce lcopt-dev\n```\n\n### Linking lcopt to brightway\n\n`lcopt-dev` makes this easy, by using the excellent [`eidl`](https://github.com/haasad/EcoInventDownLoader) developed by [Adrian Haas](https://github.com/haasad).\n\nLcopt-dev can create models using external LCI data from any version of the [ecoinvent database](http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-33/ecoinvent-33.html) (ecoinvent license required) or the [FORWAST database](http://forwast.brgm.fr/)\n\nIf you have an ecoinvent login, open up the command line/console and type:\n\n```\nlcopt-settings\n```\n\nThis will launch the settings page in your web browser. Enter your username and password, and choose your preferred version of ecoinvent. Click save.\n\n![Lcopt settings](./docs/assets/lcopt_dev_settings.jpg)\n\nThe first time you create a model, lcopt will automatically download and set up the ecoinvent database in brightway - just be patient as it takes a while. This only needs to happen once though.\n\nIf you don't have an ecoinvent login, leave this blank and lcopt will automatically download and use FORWAST instead.\n\n## Using lcopt (Easy)\n\nBelow are the basic commands to get lcopt's interactive GUI up and running to create your first model. A [Getting Started](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_Getting_Started.html) guide, including a [video runthrough](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_Getting_Started.html#video), as well as [more detailed instructions](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_use.html) are available in the [online documentation](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/).\n\nTo launch lcopt and view an example model, at the command line use:\n\n```\nlcopt-launcher\n```\n\nLcopt is written in Python, so you can also use it from within a Python shell. Open up a jupyter notebook or python shell and use the following commands:\n\n## Using Lcopt from the python shell/Jupyter notebooks (Recommended)\n\nTo import lcopt use: \n\n```python\nfrom lcopt import *\n```\n\n### Creating a new model\n\nTo create a model, you need to create an instance of the LcoptModel class using the model name as the first argument:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel('My First Model')\n```\n\nBy default the model will be populated in the background with the details to link to the version of ecoinvent you specify in settings. If you want your model to use a dirfferent version or system model you can specify this using:\n\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel('My First Ecoinvent 3.4 APOS Model', ecoinvent_version=\"3.4\", ecoinvent_system_model=\"apos\")\n```\n\nOr if you want to use FORWAST instead use:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel('My First FORWAST Model', useForwast=True)\n```\n\n### Loading an existing model\n\nLcopt saves models in your local APPDATA directory by default. In windows this is C:\\Users\\[your_name]\\AppData\\Local\\Lcopt\\Lcopt.\n\nYou can optionally tell lcopt to save models in your current directory using `lcopt-settings`\n\nTo load a model, use the model name (with or without the .lcopt extension) or the full file path (if it's not in the current directory or defualt directory), in this command:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel(load='My First Model')\n```\n\nNote : If you accidentally forget to use `load=` and you see a blank model don't panic. Lcopt won't overwrite your saved model unless you tell it to. Simply don't save the model and re-run the command with `load=`\n\n### Launching the GUI\n\nTo launch the GUI for your model simply call the `launch_interact` method of your newly created model instance:\n\n```python\nmodel.launch_interact()\n```\n\nThis will start a Flask server and launch your web browser to access the GUI. If it doesn't or you accidentally close the GUI tab, simply go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).\n\nInformation on how to use the GUI is located in 'More info...' panels dotted around at sensible locations within it.\n\nFor more details on using it, see the [documentation](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_use.html) or the [video](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_Getting_Started.html#video)\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you have any problems, questions, comments, feature requests etc. please [raise an issue here on github](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/issues)\n\nIf you want to contribute to Lcopt, you're more than welcome! Please fork the [github repository](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/) and open a pull request. \n\nLcopt uses [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html>) and Travis for automated testing, so please accompany any new features with corresponding tests. See the `tests` folder in the [source code](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/tree/master/tests) for examples.  \n\n## Cite\n\nLcopt has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00339).\n\n[![Publication](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/c0b544bee185c9ac75e96d24b8573547/status.svg)](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/c0b544bee185c9ac75e96d24b8573547)\n\nYou can download the citation in BibTeX for use in LaTeX or importing into [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)/other reference management software from [here](http://www.doi2bib.org/#/doi/10.21105/joss.00339).\n\nOr use the following citation:\n\nJoyce, P.J., 2017.
