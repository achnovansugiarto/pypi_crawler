    "description": "Hanzi Grid Tool\n====================\n\nThis is the command line tool that generated the above chinese character study grids, and with which you can create your\nown study grids.\n\n* **SVG images** - great for printing, making your own chinese character poster and hanging it on your wall!\n* **An interactive HTML page** (using the SVG images - for study on computers or mobile devices. There's also\n  Javascript/JSON output which you can immediately reuse in your own applications.\n\nThe tool is fed a list of input characters (a plain text file), and it will look up each character in HSK level 1 to 6\nand draw it on the grid along with additional information. This means you can use it to generate custom grids with\nexactly the characters **you** want and in the order you want.\n\nFeatures\n--------------\n\n* Characters can be assigned a colour corresponding to the tone (1 - red, 2 - yellow, 3 - green, 4 - blue). Characters that\n  have multiple readings, are neutral tone, or for which no pinyin could be found (if they're not in HSK) are always shown in black.\n* HSK levels can be indicated by cell background colour (HSK1-3: white, HSK4: light grey; HSK5: yellow, HSK6: red, not\n  in HSK: dark grey).  This may act as a cue for you to skip the character until you're proficient in the lowel levels.\n* Example words from the HSK lexicon are shown (up to two in the images). In the interactive form, click a character words in which they occur.\n* Showing pinyin on the grid is supported (but not enabled by default)\n* Pinyin ordering is supported (not enabled by default)\n* The alternative character (simlified/traditional) can be shown in the bottom-right corner of the cell.\n* You can determines the columns/rows/cell sizes.\n\nInstallation\n---------------\n\nFamiliarity with Python and the command line is assumed if you want to use this tool to make your own hanzi grids,\ninstall hanzigrid using pip as follows::\n\n    pip install hanzigrid\n\nUsage\n--------\n\nSee ``hanzigrid --help``\n\n\nNotes\n-------\n\nThe interactive page HTML outputted by this tool has to be served from a proper webserver, serving locally from ``file:///`` will not work well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
