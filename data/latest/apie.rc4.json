    "description": "# Application Program Interface with Eons\n\nWhether you want to make a [RESTful API](https://restfulapi.net/) or a fully functional web app, `apie` will help you build quickly and reliably: the eons way!\n\nAPIE is built on [eons](https://github.com/eons-dev/lib_eons) and uses [Eons Infrastructure Technologies](https://infrastructure.tech) to deliver modular functionality just-in-time.\n\nThe goal of developing http servers this way is to separate complex logic into a number of distinct, independent, and reusable Endpoints. This makes development easier through direct application of the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and ensures your systems are intuitive for users to apply to novel contexts after learning them once.\n\n## Installation\n`pip install apie`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run an `apie` server simply:\n```shell\napie\n```\n\nYou can specify custom interface and port like so:\n```shell\napie --host localhost --port 8080\n```\n\nYou may also specify:\n* `authenticator` - your chosen authentication modules (see below).\n* `clean_start` - whether or not to nuke cached Endpoints on startup.\n* `dev` - if true, will cause this to start in development mode as opposed to prod; more info [below](#testing-debugging-and-development)\n* `preprocessor` - an Endpoint to always run first; more info [below](#preprocessor)\n\n### apie.json\n\nAPIE will look for a file called \"apie.json\" in the directory it is launched from. If such is found, the configuration values from it will be read and processed in accordance with the eons library. For example, `apie --clean_start False` is the same as `apie` with an apie.json containing `{\"clean_start\": false}`\n\n\n### Parallelism\n\nCurrently, APIE only supports single-threaded operation. However, if your Authenticator and all your Endpoints maintain REST compatibility, you can run as many replicas of `apie` as you'd like!\n\n\n### Methods\n\nYou may use any of the following http methods:\n\n* GET\n* POST\n* PUT\n* DELETE\n* PATCH\n\n\n## Design\n\n### Authorization\n\nThe goal of authorizing requests is to prevent every api from becoming the same, since Endpoints are executed on-demand (see below), and to impose the obviously needed security.\nIf a request is not authorized, no Endpoint is called. This means you can limit which Endpoints are callable and who can call them.\n\nEach and every request must be authenticated. You may use whatever authentication system you want (including the `noauth` and `from_config` modules provided in the `apie` package).\n\nYour chosen authentication module must be of the `auth_` type if using [Eons Infrastructure Technologies](https://infrastructure.tech) (the default repository).  \nTo create your own authorization system, check out [auth_from_config.py](inc/auth/auth_from_config.py) for a starting point.  \nNOTE: Every `Authenticator` MUST return `True` or `False`.\n\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nEndpoints `.../are/all/of/these?but=not-these`; in other words each part of a request path is a separate Endpoint.\n\nTo provide functionality, `apie` will download the Endpoints for any request that is executed as part of processing that request.\nTo see where packages are downloaded from and additional options, check out the [eons python library](https://github.com/eons-dev/lib_eons).\n\nEach Endpoint may modify the next by simply setting member variables and methods ([per the eons implicit inheritance system](https://github.com/eons-dev/lib_eons/#implicit-inheritance)). For example, you might have 3 Endpoints: `package`, `photo`, and `upload`; both `package` and `photo` set a member called `file_data`; `upload` then `Fetch`es ([a method provided by eons](https://github.com/eons-dev/lib_eons/#inputs-through-configuration-file-and-fetch)) the `file_data` value and puts it somewhere; you can thus use `upload` with either precursor (e.g. `.../package/upload` and `.../photo/upload`).\n\nThis style of dynamic execution allows you to develop your API separately from its deployment environment (i.e. each module is standalone) and should make all parts of development easier.\n\n#### Returns\n\n**Only the last Endpoint is returned!**  \nThis is done to ensure that all information given is intended. If you want to provide information in your response, grab that information from the precursors, using `Fetch()`.  \nReturn values are automatically set from the `this.response` member.  \nAll Endpoints may set `this.response.code`: an [http status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) in the form of an `int`.\n\nEvery `Endpoint` should have a `this.mime` value. By default, it is `application/json`.  \nFor more on MIME Types, check out the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).\n\nIf the mime type is `application/json`, the data that are in `this.response.content.data` will be converted into a json string upon return.\n\n\n#### Security and Validation\n\nIn addition to authenticating each request, Endpoints may further restrict what can follow them via the `this.allowedNext` member (list).  \nBy specifying only a limited list of actions, even users who are allowed to call your Endpoint can't call things like `.../something/legitimate/now_dump_all_user_passwords/k_thx_bye`.  \nYou can add to the `allowedNext` member by `append(...)`ing to the list.\n\nYou may also require only certain http methods be used with your Endpoint. This is for sanity more than security. Restricting the `this.supportedMethods` member (also a list), you can prevent things like `curl -X DELETE host/create/my_resource`. The `supportedMethods` is prepopulated with all the [http methods listed above](#methods). You can remove methods from this list with `this.supportedMethods.remove(...)`.\n\n\n#### Error Handling\n\nAPIE itself keeps track of the last Endpoint it called. This allows that Endpoint to handle errors in its own execution. \n\nIf you would like to add custom error handling, override `HandleBadRequest()` in your Endpoint. By default this will print the error message, per the python Exception and tells the user to call your Endpoint with `/help` (see [below](#help)).\n\n\n### Syntax\n\nAPIE supports some unique syntax which can be specified in the request path.\n\n#### Multi\n\nA \"Multicall\" will make the same call for each element in a domain. This is essentially a foreach loop.  \nDomains can be specified by prepending \"[first_element,second_element]\" to the desired Endpoint.  \n\nRequirements:\n1. The first character must be a '['.\n2. Each element must be separated by a comma (',') WITHOUT a space (i.e. ', ' is wrong but ',' is right).\n3. The domain must end with a ']'\n4. There must be a valid Endpoint after the domain.\n\nFor example, `.../[public,private]list` would call `list` first with `public_` prepended to all Fetched arguments, then likewise with `private_`. If `list` needs a \"url\" arg, the first call would be made with `public_url` and the second would be made with `private_url`. The results of both would be combined (assuming the Content-Type is 'application/json') and a single list would be returned.\n\nFor more information, see the [multi Endpoint](inc/api/api_multi.py).\n\nWhile not yet tested, multi-multi calls should work. For example `.../[one,two][red,blue]fish` should equate to `one/red/fish`, `one/blue/fish`, `two/red/fish`, `two/blue/fish`.  \n\nNested multicalls are not yet supported (e.g. `.../[one[red,blue],two['green','yellow']]fish` will not work at the moment).  \n\n## REST Compatibility\n\nTo be \"RESTful\" means to abide the following principles.  \nMore information can be found at [restfulapi.net](https://restfulapi.net/)\n\n\n### Uniform interface\n> \"A resource in the system should have only one logical URI, and that should provide a way to fetch related or additional data\"\n\nEach combination of Endpoints yields a unique execution path (e.g. `.../package/upload` operates on different resources than `.../photo/upload`).\n\nReusing the same Endpoint should provide the same functionality (e.g. `upload` should not start downloading things).\n\nEndpoints should not provide duplicate functionality (besides, don't write the same line of code twice anyway!).\n\n> \"Once a developer becomes familiar with one of your APIs, [they] should be able to follow a similar approach for other APIs.\"\n\n\n### Clientâ€“server\n> \"Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface between them is not altered.\"\n\nIn addition to interacting with other machines over the net, the client-server paradigm is expanded to server-side processing through the use of standalone Endpoints. Each Endpoint should follow its own, independent development lifecycle and be interchangeable with any other Endpoint that provides the same up (`preceding`) and down (`next`) stream interfaces.\n\n\n### Stateless\n> \"[The server] will treat every request as new. No session, no history.\"\n\nThis part is optional and what ultimately defines RESTful compatibility in APIE.  \nIf you wish to maintain state, use a custom Authenticator as described [below](#web-apps-user-sessions-and-the-static-auth).\n\n> \"No client context shall be stored on the server between requests. The client is responsible for managing the state of the application.\"\n\n\n### Cacheable\n> \"In REST, caching shall be applied to resources when applicable, and then these resources MUST declare themselves cacheable\"\n\nTo aid in caching, every `json` Endpoint will declare itself as \"cacheable\" or not based on the `this.cacheable` member value. If your response can be cached client-side, set `this.cacheable = True` (and `this.mime = 'application/json'`)\n\n\n### Layered system\n\nYou can make calls to any other services you'd like within your Endpoints and Authenticators.\n\n\n### Code on demand (optional)\n> \"you are free to return executable code to support a part of your application\"\n\nWhat you return is entirely up to you.\n\n\n## Web Apps, User Sessions, and the Static Auth\n\nIf a RESTful application is inappropriate for your use case, you can still use apie. The only thing that changes is which Authenticator you employ. The Authenticator you choose is instantiated on startup, stored in the `auth` member of APIE, and lasts the life of the program. \n\nBecause the Authenticator checks each and every request, you can use it to change the path executed, store a history of the user's requests, etc.\n\nBoth the Authenticator and each Endpoint can access apie from the `executor` member. This means each Endpoint has access to the the Authenticator (i.e. `this.executor.auth`). \n\nCombining all this, to make your app stateful, all you have to do is build an Authenticator to track the state you'd like.\n\n\n## Testing, Debugging, and Development\n\nThere is a special `hack` Endpoint that is enabled when apie is run with `--dev True` (or equivalent, e.g. \"dev\": true in config).  \nHacking allows you to mock the functionality of downstream Endpoints.  \nThis behavior is not fully implemented but will be available soon.  \n\n\n## Additional Features\n\n\n### Preprocessor\n\nYou can set an Endpoint to be run before any other and which will not be included in the request path by specifying `preprocessor`.  \nFor example, with `{\"preprocessor\": \"myapp\"}` in your apie.json, a call to `.../access/whatever/` would be silently expanded to `.../myapp/access/whatever`\nThis is useful if you want to change Endpoints to fit a scheme suitable to your deployment, gain extra introspection, and much more.  \n\n\n### Help\n\nBy default, you can call `.../anything/help` to get information on how to use `anything`. Data are returned as a json.\n\n\n### From Config Authenticator\n\nIncluded in the apie package is the `from_config` Authenticator. This allows you to store a static authentication scheme locally.  \nThis does not help with dynamic user access but does allow you to limit what Endpoints you allow access to.\n\n\n## Resource Paradigm\n\nOne possible means of using apie is through the Resource Paradigm. This concept frames all apie requests as manipulations of resources. \n\nResources can be anything but will generally be correlated with data structures of similar shape. For example, \"user\" might be a resource, where each user has a name, email, and password. These 3 fields define the shape of a user datum.\n\nManipulations take place through Operations and Operation Implementations. Operations are simple and define a consistent interface for use across many different resources. For example, the `list` operation is always paginated, so you can `.../user/list?page=2` or `.../whatever_else/list?per_page=100`. The list operation itself simply defines what arguments can be provided, gives some standard help text for users, and establishes basic features. How `list` actually works is entirely dependent on the implementation specified in the apie configuration. For example, if you `list` files stored on the server, you might use a `local` implementation to read and reply with inode data from the local filesystem; whereas, listing items from a database would use a `database` implementation, and so on.\n\nThe apie resource paradigm looks something like:\n![image showing the layers of the apie resource paradigm](apie_resource-paradigm.png)\n",
