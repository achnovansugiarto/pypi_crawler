    "description": "# SHRDLU Blocks\n\nThis package is a rough approximation of the blocks environment originally used\nby Terry Winograd's SHDRLU program. It is meant to provide a simple and \nlightweight means for evaluating and testing natural language understanding \nsystems. Hooking into the environment is a matter of defining a single callback\nfunction and passing it into the framework.\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hosford42/SHRDLUBlocks/master/images/SHRDLU%20Blocks%20Demo%20(Cropped).png)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install:\n\n```commandline\npip install shrdlu_blocks\n```\n\n\n## Demo\n\nOnce the library is installed, you can run a simple demo from the command line\nwith:\n\n```commandline\npython -m shrdlu_blocks.demo\n```\n\nThe demo treats the input as a simple command line rather than a source of \nnatural language text. It exists primarily to serve as a coding example and a \nmeans for trying out the capabilities of the system.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```python3\n\"\"\"SHRDLU Blocks app template\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nimport pygame\n\nfrom shrdlu_blocks.control import Controller\nfrom shrdlu_blocks.viewer import Viewer\n\n\ndef callback(controller: Controller, text: str) -> Optional[str]:\n    \"\"\"This is where you hook your logic into the system.\"\"\"\n    # 1) Attempt to understand the text. \n    # 2) Determine an appropriate sequence of actions to perform.\n    # 3) Perform the actions by calling the public methods of the controller.\n    # 4) Return the text response.\n    ...\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize pygame.\n    pygame.init()\n\n    # Create a pygame display canvas.\n    screen_info = pygame.display.Info()\n    screen_width = screen_info.current_w\n    screen_height = screen_info.current_h\n    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2))\n    \n    # Run a scene viewer with the callback we defined.\n    Viewer(screen, callback=callback).run()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n\n## The Simulated Environment\n\nThe simulated environment is accessed through the controller object passed to\nyour callback. The controller is meant to be the sole access point for your NLU\nsystem to interact with the environment on behalf of the user. It provides an \n*intentionally* limited interface for querying and acting upon the scene.\n\n### Scenes\n\nThe simulated environment consists of an arbitrary collection of stateful, \nspatially arranged objects collectively referred to as a 'scene'.  \n\n### Object Positions\n\nEvery object in the scene has an associated point in scene referred to as its \nposition. The object's point of support -- the point on its bottom which is \ndirectly below its center of mass -- always coincides precisely with its\nposition.\n\n### The Grasper\n\nAll actions on the scene are mediated by one or more grasper objects. A grasper\ncan only pick up a single object at a time. It can only set an object down in a \nplace where the object will be supported. Attempting to drop an object with the\ngrasper raised, or with the grasper lowered in a place where the object\ncannot be placed, will result in an exception.\n\n### Object IDs\n\nThe controller identifies objects using unique integer indices of type \n`ObjectID`. Limited search capabilities are also provided in order to identify \nthe object IDs of objects present in the scene. The controller requires that\nobjects always be referenced by their IDs, and only returns object IDs, never\nactual objects, from queries. This is to ensure that an object's state is never\nmodified directly by the client, preventing the circumvention of the rules of\nthe simulation.\n\n### Object Tags\n\nEvery object has an associated metadata key/value mapping referred to as the\nobject's \"tags\". Except for a few specific exceptions, these are static, \narbitrary data points attached to the object during scene creation. Tags serve\nas a means for searching through and identifying the objects in the scene. Tags\ncannot be directly modified or overwritten; those whose values can change are\nalways modified indirectly by actions performed by the controller.\n\nTags with constant values that are accessed directly by the controller include:\n* `obj_id` An integer value of type `ObjectID` which serves to uniquely \n  identify the object.\n* `kind` A string value which indicates the type of the object. The particular\n  values that the controller finds interesting are `'grasper'` and `'box'`.\n* `graspable` A boolean value which indicates whether the grasper can pick up\n  the object under the appropriate conditions.\n* `can_support` A boolean value indicating whether this object can support \n  other objects placed on top of it.\n* `min_x` An optional floating point value associated with the grasper. \n  Indicates the minimum value of the x coordinate for positions the grasper can\n  be moved to.\n* `max_x` An optional floating point value associated with the grasper. \n  Indicates the maximum value of the x coordinate for positions the grasper can\n  be moved to.\n* `min_y` An optional floating point value associated with the grasper. \n  Indicates the minimum value of the y coordinate for positions the grasper can\n  be moved to.\n* `max_y` An optional floating point value associated with the grasper. \n  Indicates the maximum value of the y coordinate for positions the grasper can\n  be moved to.\n\nTags whose values are updated by the controller include:\n* `closed` A boolean flag associated with the grasper indicating whether the\n  grasper's 'hand' is closed.\n* `grasped` An optional `ObjectID` associated with the grasper indicating the \n  object currently grasped by the grasper.\n* `lowered` A boolean flag associated with the grasper indicating whether the\n  grasper has been lowered. The grasper must be lowered to grasp or release an\n  object.\n* `grasped_by` An optional `ObjectID` associated with any object indicating the\n  grasper currently grasping it.\n* `resting_on` An optional `ObjectID` associated with any object indicating the\n  object it is directly resting on.\n  \n### Controllers\n\n#### Controller Properties\n\n* `default_grasper` The `ObjectID` of default grasper. When a method is called\n  which makes reference to a grasper, and no grasper was indicated through the\n  arguments passed to the method, this is the grasper that will be used.\n\n#### Controller Query Methods\n\n* `find_objects` Return an iterator over all the objects in the scene that have\n  the specifically requested metadata tag values.\n* `get_grasped_object` Return the `ObjectID` of the object currently held by \n  the grasper.\n* `get_object_position` Return the spatial position of the object's support\n  point.\n* `get_object_tag` Return the value of a metadata tag associated with the \n  object.\n* `iter_object_tags` Return an iterator over all the tag/value metadata pairs\n  associated with the object.\n* `grasper_is_closed` Return whether the grasper is currently closed.\n* `grasper_is_lowered` Return whether the grasper is currently lowered.\n\n#### Controller Action Methods\n\n* `close_grasper` Close the grasper. Under the appropriate conditions, this \n  will also cause the grasper to grasp an object.\n* `lower_grasper` Lower the grasper until contact is made with an object or the\n  grasper is maximally extended. If the grasper is grasping an object, the \n  object will be lowered with it.\n* `move_grasper` Move the grasper to the indicated (x, y) coordinates. If the\n  grasper is grasping an object, the object will be carried with it.\n* `open_grasper` Open the grasper. Under the appropriate conditions, this will\n  also cause the grasper to release an object it has grasped. \n* `raise_grasper` Raise the grasper. If the grasper is grasping an object, the\n  object will be raised with it.\n\n\n## Links to Resources\n\n* [The Wikipedia page for SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU)\n* [Terry Winograd's SHRDLU page](https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/)\n* [SHRDLU's source code](http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/code/)\n* [Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for \n  Understanding Natural Language](https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/AITR-235.pdf)\n* [3D Graphics with Pygame (Tutorial)](https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/3d/pygame/)\n\n# MIT License\n\n**Copyright (c) 2021 Aaron Hosford**\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
