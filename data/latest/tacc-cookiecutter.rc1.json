You can use multiple languages in the same project template.\n\n* Simple command line usage:\n\n```bash\n# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\n# You'll be prompted to enter values.\n# Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,\n# based on those values.\n$ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n# For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix\n$ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n```\n\n* Use it at the command line with a local template:\n\n```bash\n# Create project in the current working directory, from the local\n# cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\n$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/\n```\n\n* Or use it from Python:\n\n```py\nfrom cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter\n\n# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\ncookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')\n\n# Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\ncookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')\n```\n\n* Directory names and filenames can be templated. For example:\n\n```py\n{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py\n```\n\n* Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.\n\n* 100% of templating is done with Jinja2. This includes file and directory names.\n\n* Simply define your template variables in a ``cookiecutter.json`` file. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"full_name\": \"Audrey Roy\",\n    \"email\": \"audreyr@gmail.com\",\n    \"project_name\": \"Complexity\",\n    \"repo_name\": \"complexity\",\n    \"project_short_description\": \"Refreshingly simple static site generator.\",\n    \"release_date\": \"2013-07-10\",\n    \"year\": \"2013\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.1\"\n}\n```\n\n* Unless you suppress it with ``--no-input``, you are prompted for input:\n\n  * Prompts are the keys in ``cookiecutter.json``.\n  * Default responses are the values in ``cookiecutter.json``.\n  * Prompts are shown in order.\n\n* Cross-platform support for ``~/.cookiecutterrc`` files:\n\n```yaml\ndefault_context:\nfull_name: \"Audrey Roy\"\nemail: \"audreyr@gmail.com\"\ngithub_username: \"audreyr\"\ncookiecutters_dir: \"~/.cookiecutters/\"\n```\n\n* Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into ``~/.cookiecutters/`` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.\n\n* If you have already cloned a cookiecutter into ``~/.cookiecutters/``, you can reference it by directory name:\n\n```bash\n# Clone cookiecutter-pypackage\n$ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n# Now you can use the already cloned cookiecutter by name\n$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage\n```\n\n* You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.\n\n* Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults whenever you generate a project.\n\n* Inject extra context with command-line arguments:\n\n```bash\ncookiecutter --no-input gh:msabramo/cookiecutter-supervisor program_name=foobar startsecs=10\n```\n\n* Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for injection of extra context.\n\n* Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after generating a project.\n\n* Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.\n\n* Projects are always generated to your current directory.\n\n## Available Cookiecutters\n\nMaking great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors. We're so pleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose from. We hope you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.\n\n### Cookiecutter Specials\n\nThese Cookiecutters are maintained by the cookiecutter team:\n\n* [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage): [@audreyr's](https://github.com/audreyr) ultimate Python package project template.\n* [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django): A bleeding edge Django project template with Bootstrap 4, customizable users app, starter templates, working user registration, celery setup, and much more.\n* [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin): Minimal Cookiecutter template for authoring [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) plugins that help you to write better programs.\n\n### Categories of Cookiecutters\n\n[Python](#python) | [Python-Django](#python-django) | [Python-Pyramid](#python-pyramid) | [Cookiecutter (meta)](#cookiecutter-meta) | [Ansible](#ansible) | [Git](#git) | [C](#c) | [C++](#c-1) | [C#](#c-sharp) | [Common Lisp](#common-lisp) | [Elm](#elm) | [Golang](#golang) | [Java](#java) | [JS](#js) | [Kotlin](#kotlin) | [LaTeX/XeTeX](#latexxetex) | [PHP](#php) | [Berkshelf-Vagrant](#berkshelf-vagrant) | [HTML](#html) | [Scala](#scala) | [6502 Assembly](#6502-Assembly) | [Data Science](#data-science) | [Tornado](#tornado) | [Reproducible Science](#reproducible-science) | [Continuous Delivery](#continuous-delivery)\n\nIf you don't find a cookiecutter that suits your needs here, please consider writing or suggesting one. We wish for our users to find a solution for their use cases, and we provide a list of other projects that we do not maintain for your convenience (please see the [Similar Projects](#similar-projects) section).\n\n## Community\n\nThe core committer team can be found in [authors section](AUTHORS.md). We are always welcome and invite you to participate.\n\nStuck? Try one of the following:\n\n* See the [Troubleshooting](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html) page.\n* Ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n* You are strongly encouraged to [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) about the problem, even if it's just \"I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter\" with a link to your cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.\n* Ask for help on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U) if you must (but please try one of the other options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion).\n\nDevelopment on Cookiecutter is community-driven:\n\n* Huge thanks to all the [contributors](AUTHORS.md) who have pitched in to help make Cookiecutter an even better tool.\n* Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md), then get started.\n\nConnect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U):\n\n* [https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U](https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U) (note: due to work and commitments, a core committer might not always be available)\n\nEncouragement is unbelievably motivating. If you want more work done on Cookiecutter, show support:\n\n* Thank a core committer for their efforts.\n* Star [Cookiecutter on GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).\n* [Support this project](#support-this-project)\n\nGot criticism or complaints?\n\n* [File an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly and constructive about what could be better. Make detailed suggestions.\n* **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.** For example, if you are discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on the email.\n* Be encouraging. A comment like \"This function ought to be rewritten like this\" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like \"Eww, look how bad this function is.\"\n\nWaiting for a response to an issue/question?\n\n* Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through. If urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.\n* Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.\n* Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.\n* Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait? [@audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr) is available for hire for consultation or custom development.\n\n## Support This Project\n\nThis project is run by volunteers. Shortly we will be providing means for organizations and individuals to support the project.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone interacting in the Cookiecutter project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/).\n\n## A Pantry Full of Cookiecutters\n\nYou can check all [cookiecutter templates](https://github.com/topics/cookiecutter-template) on GitHub. If you are template publisher keep in mind to add the ``cookiecutter-template`` topic to your repository and the correct language tags.\n\nPlease avoid creating PRs for listing additional templates. We outsourced their listing due to extra maintenance required to review them. We will likely replace the lists below with links to GitHub queries for each category.\n\n### Python\n\n* [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage): [@audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr)'s ultimate Python package project template.\n* [cookiecutter-pipproject](https://github.com/wdm0006/cookiecutter-pipproject): Minimal package for pip-installable projects.\n* [cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal](https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal): A minimal Python package template.\n* [cookiecutter-lux-python](https://github.com/alexkey/cookiecutter-lux-python): A boilerplate Python project that aims to create Python package with a convenient Makefile-facility and additional helpers.\n* [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/cookiecutter-flask/cookiecutter-flask) : A Flask template with Bootstrap 3, starter templates, and working user registration.\n* [cookiecutter-flask-2](https://github.com/wdm0006/cookiecutter-flask): A heavier weight fork of cookiecutter-flask, with more boilerplate including forgotten password and Heroku integration.\n* [cookiecutter-flask-foundation](https://github.com/JackStouffer/cookiecutter-Flask-Foundation) : Flask Template with caching, forms, sqlalchemy and unit-testing.\n* [cookiecutter-flask-minimal](https://github.com/candidtim/cookiecutter-flask-minimal) : Minimal but production-ready Flask project template with no other dependencies except for Flask itself.\n* [cookiecutter-flask-skeleton](https://github.com/realpython/cookiecutter-flask-skeleton) : Flask starter project.\n* [cookiecutter-bottle](https://github.com/avelino/cookiecutter-bottle) : A cookiecutter template for creating reusable Bottle projects quickly.\n* [cookiecutter-openstack](https://github.com/openstack/cookiecutter): A template for an OpenStack project.\n* [cookiecutter-docopt](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-docopt): A template for a Python command-line script that uses [docopt](http://docopt.org/) for arguments parsing.\n* [cookiecutter-quokka-module](https://github.com/quokkaproject/cookiecutter-quokka-module): A template to create a blueprint module for Quokka Flask CMS.\n* [cookiecutter-kivy](https://github.com/hackebrot/cookiecutter-kivy): A template for NUI applications built upon the kivy python-framework.\n* [cookiedozer](https://github.com/hackebrot/cookiedozer): A template for Python Kivy apps ready to be deployed to android devices with Buildozer.\n* [cookiecutter-pylibrary](https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary): An intricate template designed to quickly get started with good testing and packaging (working configuration for Tox, Pytest, Travis-CI, Coveralls, AppVeyor, Sphinx docs, isort, bumpversion, packaging checks etc).\n* [cookiecutter-pyvanguard](https://github.com/robinandeer/cookiecutter-pyvanguard): A template for cutting edge Python development.
