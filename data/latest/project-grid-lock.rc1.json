    "description": "The concept behind this is to let the user choose their password by looking at an image. Each image contains a few regions known as \"hotspots,\" which refer to the areas of the image that are most frequently looked at; however, each image also tells a different story and maybe particular to each individual. After doing some research, each image has a few areas known as \"hotspots,\" which refer to the parts of the image that are most frequently looked at; however, each image also tells a different story and might be unique to each person. Research has shown that humans find it easier to remember a story or series of events when compared to remembering a list of alphanumeric characters.\nBy allowing the user to choose the image they want to use as a password, GridLock will be able to make sure that it has a special property that only the user is aware of, namely, users' perspective towards the moment or the picture. Keeping this in mind, I intend to create an encryption system that allows users to choose specific elements of an image in a specific order to encrypt any password. This system would be paired with each user's individual perspective and the image they want to use as the basis for their password. This is especially helpful for various private software developers to incorporate into their software instead of the conventional (outdated) password protection system.\n\nChangelog \n==========================================\n\n1.0 (02/10/2022) \n------------------------------------------\n- First release",
