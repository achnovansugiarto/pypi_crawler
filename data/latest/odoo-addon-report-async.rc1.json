Run Now - run report immediately as per normal.\n2. Run Background - put the report execution to queue job.\n\nBy using the queue job, option 2 is great for long running report.\nThe report file will be saved for later use, with the option to send report\nby email as soon as it is ready.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Only user with Technical Feature rights can manage the report.\n* Every internal user will have right to execute the report allowed for his/her groups.\n* The files created are owned and viewable only by the person who run the report.\n* Job queue manager can also see all jobs for each reports.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nMenu: Dashboard > Report Center\n\nAs Technical Feature users, you can manage reports for Report Center.\n\n- **Report:** choose the report (a window action). Although the option show all window actions\n  it only make sense for window actions that launch reports.\n- **Allow Async:** check this, if you want the report to run in background too, suitable for\n  report that return file as result, i.e., pdf/xlsx/csv/txt.\n- **Email Notification:** if checked, once the background process is completed, email with link to download\n  report will be sent.\n- **Groups:** select user groups allowed to use this report. If left blank, all user can use.\n\nAs normal user, you can run your reports from Report Center\n\n- **Run Now button:** to run report immediately as per normal.\n- **Run Background button:** to run report asynchronously. Fall back to run now, if not report that produce file.\n- **Job Status:** show status of the latest run job. If job fail, exception error will also shown\n- **Files:** show all files being produced by the job as run by the user.\n- **Jobs:** show all jobs triggered by this report as run by the user. Only job queue manager have access to this button.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/issues/new?body=module:%20report_async%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Ecosoft\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Ecosoft <http://ecosoft.co.th>`__:\n\n  * Kitti U. <kittiu@ecosoft.co.th>\n  * Saran Lim. <saranl@ecosoft.co.th>\n  * Tharathip Chaweewongphan <tharathipc@ecosoft.co.th>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-kittiu| image:: https://github.com/kittiu.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/kittiu\n    :alt: kittiu\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-kittiu| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/reporting-engine <https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/tree/15.0/report_async>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
