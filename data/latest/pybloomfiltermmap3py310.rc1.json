    "description": "# pybloomfiltermmap3\n\n[pybloomfiltermmap3](https://github.com/prashnts/pybloomfiltermmap3) is a Python 3 compatible fork of [pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap) by [@axiak](https://github.com/axiak).\n\nThe goal of `pybloomfiltermmap3` is simple: to provide a fast, simple, scalable, correct library for Bloom filters in Python.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PrashntS/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PrashntS/pybloomfiltermmap3)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pybloomfiltermmap3/badge/?version=latest)](https://pybloomfiltermmap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)\n\n\n## Why pybloomfiltermmap3?\n\nThere are a couple reasons to use this module:\n\n* It natively uses [mmaped files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap).\n* It is fast (see [benchmarks](http://axiak.github.io/pybloomfiltermmap/#benchmarks)).\n* It natively does the set things you want a Bloom filter to do.\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\nAfter you install, the interface to use is a cross between a file\ninterface and an ste interface. As an example:\n```python\n    >>> import pybloomfilter\n    >>> fruit = pybloomfilter.BloomFilter(100000, 0.1, '/tmp/words.bloom')\n    >>> fruit.update(('apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'apple'))\n    >>> len(fruit)\n    3\n    >>> 'mike' in fruit\n    False\n    >>> 'apple' in fruit\n    True\n```\n\nTo create an in-memory filter, simply omit the file location:\n```python\n    >>> cakes = pybloomfilter.BloomFilter(10000, 0.1)\n```\n*Caveat*: it is currently not possible to persist this filter later.\n\n\n## Docs\n\nCurrent docs are available at [pybloomfiltermmap3.rtfd.io](https://pybloomfiltermmap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\n\n## Install\n\nTo install:\n\n```shell\n    $ pip install pybloomfiltermmap3\n```\n\nand you should be set.\n\n### Note to Python 2 to < 3.5 users\n\nThis library is specifically meant for Python 3.5 and above. [As of 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), we strongly advise you to switch to an actively maintained distribution of Python 3. If for any reason your current environment is restricted to Python 2, please see [pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap). Please note that the latter is not actively maintained and will lack bug fixes and new features.\n\n\n## History and Future\n\n[pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap) is an excellent Bloom filter implementation for Python 2 by [@axiak](https://github.com/axiak) and contributors. I, [@prashnts](https://github.com/prashnts), made initial changes to add support for Python 3 sometime in 2016 as the current [pybloomfiltermmap3](https://pypi.org/project/pybloomfiltermmap3/) on `PyPI`. Since then, with the help of contributors, there have been incremental improvements and bug fixes while maintaining the API from versions `0.4.x` and below.\n\nSome new features and changes were first introduced in version `0.5.0`. From this point on, the goal is to reach stability, as well as add a few more APIs to expand upon the use cases. While we can't guarantee that we won't change the current interface, the transition from versions `0.4.x` and below should be quick one liners. Please open an issue if we broke your build!\n\nSuggestions, bug reports, and / or patches are welcome!\n\n\n## Contributions and development\n\nWhen contributing, you should set up an appropriate Python 3 environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements-dev.txt`.\nPackage installation depends on a generated `pybloomfilter.c` file, which requires Cython module to be in your current environment.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n* [Prashant Sinha](https://github.com/prashnts)\n* [Vytautas Mizgiris](https://github.com/vmizg)\n\n\n## License\n\nSee the LICENSE file.
