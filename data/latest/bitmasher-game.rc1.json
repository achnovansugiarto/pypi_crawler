Typing that character and hitting ENTER will select that option.\n\n## How to Play\n\nYou are an antivirus trying to rid a computer of a RANSOMWARE before it takes over the system. There is a finite amount of time before the system is fully infected.\n\nIn order to defeat it, you must find all items before you find the RANSOMWARE. If you do not, you will not be able to EXTRACT it and you will lose.\n\nEach system (room) contains an item, which you can move to; UP, DOWN, LEFT, AND RIGHT. Keep in mind that the map is NOT 2D; Moving RIGHT, UP, LEFT, and DOWN will lead to a different room than the one you started in. The map is \"Spiky\" so-to-speak.\n\nYou have a SCANner to aid in figuring out which rooms contain items and which have RANSOMWARE. Using the SCANner will reveal what the surronding rooms contain, and the room you are currently in will be automatically SCANned for you. But beware: SCANning takes time. Also, occasionaly a SCAN will fail and need to be repeated.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThere is a section at the top of the program file ([TextBasedGame.py](src/bitmasher_game/TextBasedGame.py \"BitMasher program file\")) containing configuration options. All config options bear a description detailing what they modify and what values they accept.\n\n## Installation\n\nBitMasher is avalible on PyPi, and can be installed by running the following command(s):\n\n```console\npip install bitmasher_game\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can download the latest package from [Releases,](https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/BitMasher/releases \"BitMasher releases.\") or build from source, and install it using the following command(s):\n\n```console\npip install <package name goes here>\n```\n\nBitMasher can also be ran directly as a simple script without installation. See [How to Run](README.md#how-to-run \"How to run section.\")\n\n## How to run\n\nIf installed, run the following command(s):\n\n```console\nbitmasher\n```\n\nBitMasher is, itself, a stand-alone script ([TextBasedGame.py](src/bitmasher_game/TextBasedGame.py \"TextBasedGame.py\")), and can be ran without installation by running one of the following command(s) in the project directory:\n\n```console\npython3 src/bitmasher_game/TextBasedGame.py\n./src/bitmasher_game/TextBasedGame.py\n```\n\n## How to build\n\nRun the following commands in the project directory:\n\n```console\npython3 -m build\n```\n\nThe built packages will appear in [dist/.](dist \"Distributables folder.\")\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe only dependency is [Python 3.](https://www.python.org \"Python homepage\")\n\n## Links\n\nDemonstration:<br>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxC5pLrn6N8\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
