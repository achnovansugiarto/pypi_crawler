    "description": "# names_matcher library\n## Matching and ratio methods for program code names  \n\nProgram code contains functions, variables, and data structures that are represented by names. To promote human understanding, these names should describe the role and use of the code elements they represent. But the names given by developers show high variability, reflecting the tastes of each developer, with different words used for the same meaning or the same words used for different meanings. This makes comparing names hard. A precise comparison should be based on matching identical words, but also take into account possible variations on the words (including spelling and typing errors), reordering of the words, matching between synonyms, and so on. \n\nTo facilitate this we developed a library of comparison functions specifically targeted to comparing names in code. The different functions calculate the similarity between names in different ways, so a researcher can choose the one appropriate for his specific needs. All of them share an attempt to reflect human perceptions of similarity, at the possible expense of lexical matching.\n\nThe ratio's formula was described in the project document (http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03198). \n\n\n## User Manual\n\n1. install namecompare library (by running \"**pip install namecompare**\").\n2. In the head of the python file type \"**import names_matcher**\".\n3. Generate **names_matcher.NamesMatcher** object, set names to compare, and run comparison function (as detailed below)... \n \n\nExample:\n    \n    import names_matcher\n    print(names_matcher.NamesMatcher('FirstLightAFire', 'LightTheFireFirst').ordered_words_match())\n\nOutput:\n\n    name_1: ['first', 'light', 'a', 'fire'], name_2: ['light', 'the', 'fire', 'first']\n    Ratio: 0.4\n    Matches:\n\t    name_1[1:2], name_2[0:1], length: 1, local ratio: 1.0, partial ratio: 0.2:\n\t\t    ['light'] vs. \n\t\t    ['light']\n\t    name_1[3:4], name_2[2:3], length: 1, local ratio: 1.0, partial ratio: 0.2:\n\t\t    ['fire'] vs. \n\t\t    ['fire']\n\n\n\n\n## Classes\n\n### class *names_matcher.Var*\n\nA class contains all the needed data about a variable:\n- **name**: its original name (string).\n- **words**: list of the words the variable built from.\n- **norm_name**: variable's name after normalization.\n- **separator**: a special character that doesn't exist in both variables, for internal use while searching for a match.\n\n### class *names_matcher.OneMatch*\n\nA class contains the data about one match:\n\n- **i**: the index of the match in the first variable.\n- **j**: the index of the match in the second variable.\n- **k**: the length of the match.\n- **l**: when the comparison based on words, this variable contains number of letters in these words.\n- **r**: when the comparison based on words, this variable contains the ratio of the match.\n\n### class *names_matcher.MatchingBlocks*\n\nA class contains the data about all the matches.\nThis class has a converter to string that prints readable summary about its matches.\n\n  #### Constants:\n    LETTERS_MATCH = 0\n    WORDS_MATCH = 1\n\n    CONTINUOUS_MATCH = 0\n    DISCONTINUOUS_MATCH = 1\n\n- **name_1**: the first string or list of words to be compared.\n- **name_2**: the second string or list of words to be compared.\n- **ratio**: the total ratio between the two strings of lists of words.\n- **matching_type**: *LETTERS_MATCH* for string matching, and *WORDS_MATCH* for list-of-words matching.\n- **cont_type**: *CONTINUOUS_MATCH* for matching only between continuous letters (so if minimum match is 2 letters - two uncontinuous letters will never be related as a one match), and DISCONTINUOUS_MATCH for *unedit_match()* function, that after matching a sub-string, its two sides attached together (so one letter from left side and one from right side will be related as two continuous letters).\n- **continuity_heavy_weight**: the weight to let to continuity. False means relating to the \"glue\" between all the letters or words as one component, while True means relating each \"glue\" as one element. This \"glue\" means: for letting to match of some continuous elements heavy weight than the same number of single elements, we give a weight also to the \"space\" between letters, that will be received only when the elements of both sides of this space matches in one match. The weight of that is set by this variable.     \n\n### class *names_matcher.NamesMatcher*\n\n#### Constants:\n    NUMBERS_SEPARATE_WORD = 0\n    NUMBERS_IGNORE = 1\n    NUMBERS_LEAVE = 2\n\nThis is the main library's class, that calculates the matches. It contains:\n\n- **name_1**: a Var class with all data about the first variable\n- **name_2**: a Var class with all data about the second variable\n- **case_sensitivity**: a Boolean (default: false), that set if to save the case when transforming the variables to their “normal form”\n- **word_separator**: a string that contains all the characters in the variables that are used as a separator between words (default: “_”)\n- **support_camel_case**: a Boolean that set if to relate to moving from a little letter to a big one marks on a new word, or not (default: true)\n- **numbers_behavior**: variable that set how to relate to digits in the variable (default: *NUMBERS_SEPARATE_WORD*): \n  - *NUMBERS_SEPARATE_WORD* means relate to the number as a separate word.\n  - *NUMBERS_IGNORE* means remove them from the normalized variable. \n  - *NUMBERS_LEAVE* means leaving them in their place.\n- **stop_words**: list of Stop Words that could be ignored when comparing words. If this parameter is None, the list will be the default one:\n\n\n    [a, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, not, of, on, so, the, there, was, were]\n\n## Methods\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_name_1*(name)\nSet the first name to be compared.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_name_1*()\nGet the first name to be compared.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_name_2*(name)\nSet the second name to be compared.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_name_2*()\nGet the second name to be compared.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_names*(name_1, name_2)\nSet the both names to be compared.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_norm_names*()\nGet the both name after normalization (removing spaces, replacing to small letters - if *case_sensitivity*==False, etc.).\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_words*()\nGet the both name after dividing to words (depends on *word_separators* value).\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_case_sensitivity*(case_sensitivity)\nSet *case_sensitivity* value. \n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_case_sensitivity*()\nGet *case_sensitivity* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_word_separators*(word_separators)\nSet *word_separators* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_word_separators*()\nGet *word_separators* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_support_camel_case*(support_camel_case)\nSet *support_camel_case* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_support_camel_case*()\nGet *support_camel_case* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_numbers_behavior*(numbers_behavior)\nSet *numbers_behavior* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_numbers_behavior*()\nGet *numbers_behavior* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*set_stop_words*(stop_words)\nSet *stop_words* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*get_stop_words*(stop_words)\nGet *stop_words* value.\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*edit_distance*(enable_transposition=False)\nA function that uses *strsimpy* library to calculate the Edit Distance between *NamesMatcher*.name_1 and *NamesMatcher*.name_2. \n\nIf *enable_transposition*==False, it uses Levenshtein distance, else it uses Damerau distance.\n\n#### Return value:\n\nInteger value.\n\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*normalized_edit_distance*(enable_transposition=False)\nA function that uses *strsimpy* library to calculate the Edit **Distance** between *NamesMatcher*.name_1 and *NamesMatcher*.name_2, and normalizes the result to be in the range [0,1] (by dividing the distance by number of letters in the longest name).\n\nIf *enable_transposition*==False, it uses Levenshtein distance, else it uses Damerau distance.\n\n#### Return value:\n\nFloat value.\n\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*difflib_match_ratio*()\nA function that uses *difflib.SequenceMatcher* to calculate the **ratio** between *NamesMatcher*.name_1 and *NamesMatcher*.name_2.\n\n#### Return value:\n\n*MatchingBlocks* object.\n\n\n### names_matcher.NamesMatcher.*ordered_match*(min_len=2, continuity_heavy_weight=False)\n\n  A method that works like Sequence Matcher algorithm - finding at first the longest match and continue recursively on both sides of the match, but every time that there are more than one match with the same length - this method finds the longest matches **that maximize the ratio between the variables**.\n  \n  **Note:** this method uses Dynamic Programming for calculate that.
