I want to forecast sales for April and I'm going to\nanalyze sales on March, but I want to forecast how the recommended products behave\nfrom this period to the next one. I also want to analyze, a normal year as 2020 was\nvery irregular due to pandemy, so I'll use 2019 as my year of reference.\n\nThe wizard will take the deliveries from March 2019 and then the deliveries from\nApril 2019 and then it will compute the increment between those two periods.\n\nWith that increment, the wizard will analyze the deliveries for March of the present\nyear and then it will apply the increment computed for 2019 and those will be the\nquantities that we'll be recommending according to the current stock.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. Create a new purchase order.\n#. Assign its supplier.\n#. Press *Recommended Products* button and the recommendator wizard will show up.\n\nIn the recommendator:\n\n#. Choose a period and other filters you may need.\n#. Choose a year of reference. Note that there will only be years from the first\n   customer delivery.\n#. For those products with history in the period corresponding to the year of\n   reference, a computed increment will be shown and the recommended quantities will\n   be computed according to that increment and the current available stock.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20purchase_order_product_recommendation_forecast%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * David Vidal\n  * Carlos Roca\n  * Pilar Vargas\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/purchase-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/tree/15.0/purchase_order_product_recommendation_forecast>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
