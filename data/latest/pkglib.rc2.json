    "description": "PkgLib: Company-centric Python packaging and testing library\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nKindly open-sourced by AHL, this library has the goal of providing a \r\none-stop-shop for Python development houses to get up and running using Python \r\nwith the minimum of fuss in a Linux development environment.\r\n\r\nThis library has three main components: \r\n\r\n- ``pkglib``: a set of packaging tools which extend on a number of the major \r\n  packaging toolsets in Python - distribute, pip and zc.buildout.\r\n              \r\n- ``pkglib.testing``: a suite of testing utilities to assist with handling \r\n  services, databases, web drivers and coverage amongst other things, as well \r\n  as a number of useful ``py.test`` plugins.\r\n                      \r\n- ``pkglib.project_template``: a PasteScript template for generating packages \r\n  that integrate with ``pkglib``\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThere are the slides from my EuroPython 2013 talk up at \r\nhttp://github.com/eeaston/pkglib-docs, and the API docs are published at \r\nhttps://readthedocs.org/projects/pkglib.\r\n                          \r\nHeadline Features\r\n=================\r\n\r\nPkgLib\r\n------\r\n\r\n- Package metadata all sourced from text-file ``setup.cfg``, making it easier \r\n  to parse package configuration by other releated tools.\r\n  \r\n- Advanced dependency management:\r\n\r\n  + Allows configuration of in-house company packages that are treated \r\n    differently than third-party libraries.\r\n  + Backtracking dependency resolver to solve the difficult 'diamond problem' \r\n    of version resolution in complex dependency graphs.\r\n  + Understands 'dev' and 'release' version streams, allowing the user to \r\n    operate in either mode. \r\n  + Tools to visualise dependency graphs from your current virtualenv.\r\n\r\n- Improved PyPI interaction, prompts for user credentials and raises correct \r\n  Unix return codes on error.\r\n  \r\n- Installer search path support to allow eggs to be linked into virtualenvs \r\n  from shared disk, an important feature when working on shared filesystems in \r\n  large teams.  \r\n  \r\n- Keeps things neat and tidy - cleans out unused packages from your virtualenv's \r\n  site-packages directory. \r\n  \r\n- Py.Test integration with ``python setup.py test``:\r\n\r\n  + Configured for sensible defaults for code coverage and quality analysis\r\n  + Detects when running under Jenkins and Hudson, swapping to file-based \r\n    reporting and altering tempfile creation.\r\n    \r\n- Command-line tool for managing software 'platforms', an abstraction upon \r\n  single packages when large numbers of interdependant packages are released \r\n  together.\r\n\r\n- Checkout and setup packages from in-house repositories by name rather than \r\n  url.\r\n   \r\n- Numerous powerful ``setup.py`` targets:\r\n\r\n  + Combine standalone package docs with automatic API documentation using \r\n    Sphinx.\r\n  + Run tests using gcov to allow gathering code coverage of C/C++ extensions.\r\n  + Synchronise checkouts and libraries with VCS and PyPI\r\n  + Create Jenkins/Hudson builds.\r\n  + Generate revision-linked development eggs for build systems.\r\n  + Generate test-only eggs to capture test code and runtime options.\r\n  + Deploy package to versioned virtualenvs.\r\n\r\n- 'Batteries Included' project template\r\n\r\n\r\nPkgLib.Testing\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n- Utilities with associated Py.Test fixture plugins for:\r\n\r\n  + Profiling code execution, including C/C++ extensions\r\n  + Managing temp dirs\r\n  + Creating virutalenvs\r\n  + Creating ``pkglib`` enabled packages\r\n  + Running up servers instances in a port-safe manner, with save, restore and \r\n    teardown.\r\n  + Supported servers include jenkins, redis, mongodb, Pyramid and (TODO) a \r\n    minimal PyPI implementation.\r\n  + Selenium Webdriver, integrated with the Pyramid server runner plugin.\r\n- Page Objects pattern implementation for better structured Selenium tests.\r\n- Mocking implementations for databases and other common types.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* Full support for git and mercurial.\r\n* OSX support\r\n* Python 2.4 -> 3.x support for core distlib functionality.\r\n* Upgrade to latest versions of distribute, and bring the project in-line with \r\n  recent developements in the Python packaging space like ``distlib``.\r\n* Add support for wheel binary distribution format.\r\n\r\n                        \r\nContributors\r\n============\r\n\r\n- Edward Easton (eeaston@gmail.com)\r\n- David Moss (drkjam@gmail.com)\r\n- Terry Santegoeds\r\n- Ed Catmur (ed@catmur.co.uk)\r\n- Ben Walsh\r\n- Tim Couper (drtimcouper@gmail.com)\r\n- Inti Ocean (me@inti.co)\r\n- Andrew Burrows\r\n- James Blackburn\r\n- Stepan Kolesnik (wigbam@yahoo.co.uk)\r\n- Oisin Mulvihill (oisin.mulvihill@gmail.com)",
