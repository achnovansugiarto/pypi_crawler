My library will use data visualization tools already in place, such as Plotly DASH, as well as some data-processing tools like Python Pandas, combining these two to make the final result.\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/scb-school/epi-spread-visualizer/workflows/Build%20Status/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/scb-school/epi-spread-visualizer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Status%22)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/scb-school/epi-spread-visualizer/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/scb-school/epi-spread-visualizer)\n\n## Details\nThis project is a pure python project using modern tooling. It uses a `Makefile` as a command registry, with the following commands:\n- `make`: list available commands\n- `make develop`: install and build this library and its dependencies using `pip`\n- `make build`: build the library using `setuptools`\n- `make lint`: perform static analysis of this library with `flake8` and `black`\n- `make format`: autoformat this library using `black`\n- `make annotate`: run type checking using `mypy`\n- `make test`: run automated tests with `pytest`\n- `make coverage`: run automated tests with `pytest` and collect coverage information\n- `make dist`: package library for distribution\n\n## Installation\n```bash\n$ pip3 install epispread\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n```python\nfrom epispread import EpiSpread\n\nmy_epispread_object = EpiSpread(EpiSpread.FILE)\nepi_instance.world.to_csv('world.csv', index=False)\nepi_instance.plot_all()\n\n",
