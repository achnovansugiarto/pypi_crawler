    "description": "PyWeather\n=========\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nPyWeather contains weather related modules implemented in Python.\nAnything weather related is fair game for PyWeather.  Currently\nPyWeather is limited to unit conversion, console reading, and data\npublication.  But, future work can be added to PyWeather in any area.\n\n\nUnit Conversion\n---------------\n\nPyWeather has a lot of support for common unit conversions in\ndistance, temperature, pressure, and volume.  Conversion from\nFahrenheit to Celsius, and kelvin is supported, as well as conversions\nbetween inches of mercury and millibars.\n\n\nStation Observations\n--------------------\n\nPyWeather also contains modules that are capable of downloading\nobservations from weather consoles.  The current list of supported\nweather consoles includes:\n\n- Davis Vantage Pro\n- Davis Vantage Pro2\n\n\nData Publication\n----------------\n\nPyWeather contains a module that allows developers to post conditions\nto weather aggregation sites. The current list of support services includes:\n\n- WeatherUnderground (wundgerground.com)\n- PWS Weather        (pwsweather.com)\n- WeatherForYou      (weatherforyou.com)\n\n\nFor additional information, please email the maintainer:\n   pyweather@tuxcoder.com",
