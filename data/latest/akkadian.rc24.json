    "description": "# Akkademia\nAkkademia is a tool for automatically transliterating Unicode cuneiform glyphs. It is written in python script and uses HMM, MEMM and BiLSTM neural networks to determine appropriate sign-readings and segmentation.\n\nWe trained these algorithms on the RINAP corpora (Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period), which are available in JSON and XML/TEI formats thanks to the efforts of the Official Inscriptions of the Middle East in Antiquity (OIMEA) Munich Project of Karen Radner and Jamie Novotny, funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, available [here](<http://oracc.org/rinap/>). We achieve accuracy rates of 89.5% with HMM, 94% with MEMM, and 96.7% with BiLSTM on the trained corpora. Our model can also be used on texts from other periods and genres, with varying levels of success.\n\n## Getting Started\nAkkademia can be accessed in three different ways:\n* Website\n* Python package\n* Github clone\n\nThe website and python package are meant to be accessible to people without advanced programming knowledge.\n\n## Website\nGo to the [Babylonian Engine website](<https://babylonian.herokuapp.com/>) (*under development*)\n\nGo to the \"Akkademia\" tab and follow the instructions there for transliterating your signs.\n\n## Python Package\nOur python package \"akkadian\" will enable you to use Akkademia on your local machine.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou will need a Python 3.7.x installed. Our package currently does not work with other versions of python. You can follow the installation instructions [here](<https://realpython.com/installing-python/>) or go straight ahead to [python's downloads page](<https://www.python.org/downloads/>) and pick an appropriate version.\n\nMac comes preinstalled with python 2.7, which may remain the default python version even after installing 3.7.x. To check, type ``python --version`` into terminal. If the running version is python 2.7, the simplest short-term solution is to type ``python3`` or ``pip3`` in Terminal throughout instead of ``python`` and ``pip`` as in the instructions below.\n\n### Package Installation\nYou can install the package using the pip install function. If you do not have pip installed on your computer, or you are not sure whether it is installed or not, you can follow the instructions [here](<https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/>)\n\nBefore installing the package akkadian, you will need to install the torch package. For Windows, copy the following into Command Prompt (CMD):\n\n```\npip install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n```\nFor Mac and Linux copy the following into Terminal:\n\n```\npip install torch torchvision\n```\nThen, type the following in Command Prompt (Windows), or Terminal (Mac and Linux):\n\n```\npip install akkadian\n```\nyour installation should be executed. This will take several minutes.\n\n### Running\nOpen a python IDE (Integrated development environment) where a python code can be run. There are many possible IDEs, see [realpython's guide](<https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/>) or [wiki python's list](<https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments>). For beginners, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook: see downloading instructions [here](<https://jupyter.org/install>), or see downloading instructions and beginners' tutorial [here](<https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/>).\n\nFirst, import ```akkadian.transliterate``` into your coding environment:\n\n```\nimport akkadian.transliterate as akk\n```\n\nThen, you can use HMM, MEMM, or BiLSTM to transliterate the signs. The functions are:\n\n```\nakk.transliterate_hmm(\"Unicode_signs_here\")\nakk.transliterate_memm(\"Unicode_signs_here\")\nakk.transliterate_bilstm(\"Unicode_signs_here\")\nakk.transliterate_bilstm_top3(\"Unicode_signs_here\")\n```\n```akk.transliterate_bilstm_top3``` gives the top three BiLSTM options, while ```akk.transliterate_bilstm``` gives only the top one.\n\nFor an immediate output of the results, put the ```akk.transliterate()``` function inside the ```print()``` function. Here are some examples with their output:\n```\nprint(akk.transliterate_hmm(\"𒃻𒅘𒁀𒄿𒈬𒊒𒅖𒁲𒈠𒀀𒋾\"))\nša₂ nak-ba-i-mu-ru iš-di-ma-a-ti\n```\n```\nprint(akk.transliterate_memm(\"𒃻𒅘𒁀𒄿𒈬𒊒𒅖𒁲𒈠𒀀𒋾\"))\nša₂ SILIM ba-i-mu-ru-iš-di-ma-a-ti\n```\n```\nprint(akk.transliterate_bilstm(\"𒃻𒅘𒁀𒄿𒈬𒊒𒅖𒁲𒈠𒀀𒋾\"))\nša₂ nak-ba-i-mu-ru iš-di-ma-a-ti \n```\n```\nprint(akk.transliterate_bilstm_top3(\"𒃻𒅘𒁀𒄿𒈬𒊒𒅖𒁲𒈠𒀀𒋾\"))\n('ša₂ nak-ba-i-mu-ru iš-di-ma-a-ti ', 'ša₂-di-ba i mu ru-iš di ma tukul-tu ', 'MUN kis BA še-MU-šub-šah-ṭi-nab-nu-ti-')\n```\n\nThis line was taken from the first line of the Epic of Gilgamesh: *ša₂ naq-ba i-mu-ru iš-di ma-a-ti*; \"He who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country\" (George, A.R. 2003. *The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts*. 2 vols. Oxford: Oxford University Press). Although the algorithms were not trained on this text genre, they show promising, useful results.\n\n## Github\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou will need a Python 3.7.x installed. Our package currently does not work with other versions of python. Go to [python's downloads page](<https://www.python.org/downloads/>) and pick an appropriate version.\n\nIf you don't have git installed, install git [here](<https://git-scm.com/downloads>) (Choose the appropriate operating system).\n\nIf you don't have a Github user, create one [here](<https://github.com/join?source=header-home>).\n\n### Installing the python dependencies\n\nIn order to run the code, you will need the torch and allennlp libraries. If you have already installed the package akkadian, these were installed on your computer and you can skip to the next step.\n\nInstall torch: For Windows, copy the following to Command Prompt\n```\npip install torch===1.3.1 torchvision===0.4.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n```\n\nfor Mac and Linux, copy the following to Terminal\n```\npip install torch torchvision\n```\n\nInstall allennlp: copy the following to Command Prompt (with windows) or Terminal (with mac): \n```\npip install allennlp==0.8.5\n```\n\n### Cloning the project\n\nCopy the following into Command Prompt (with windows) or Terminal (with mac) to clone the project:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/gaigutherz/Akkademia.git\n```\n\n### Running\nNow you can develop the Akkademia repository and add your improvements!\n\n#### Training\nUse the file train.py in order to train the models using the datasets. There is a function for each model that trains, stores the pickle and tests its performance on a specific corpora.\n\nThe functions are as follows:\n```\nhmm_train_and_test(corpora)\nmemm_train_and_test(corpora)\nbiLSTM_train_and_test(corpora)\n```\n\n#### Transliterating\nUse the file transliterate.py in order to transliterate using the models. There is a function for each model that takes Unicode cuneiform signs as parameter and returns its transliteration.\n\nExample of usage:\n```\ncuneiform_signs = \"𒃻𒅘𒁀𒄿𒈬𒊒𒅖𒁲𒈠𒀀𒋾\"\nprint(transliterate(cuneiform_signs))\nprint(transliterate_bilstm(cuneiform_signs))\nprint(transliterate_bilstm_top3(cuneiform_signs))\nprint(transliterate_hmm(cuneiform_signs))\nprint(transliterate_memm(cuneiform_signs))\n```\n\n## Datasets\nFor training the algorithms, we used the RINAP corpora (Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period), which are available in JSON and XML/TEI formats thanks to the efforts of the Humboldt Foundation-funded Official Inscriptions of the Middle East in Antiquity (OIMEA) Munich Project led by Karen Radner and Jamie Novotny, available [here](<http://oracc.org/rinap/>). The current output in our website, package and code is based on training done on these corpora alone.\n\nFor additional future training, we added the following corpora (in JSON file format) to the repository: \n\n* **RIAO** - [Royal Inscriptions of Assyria online](<http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/riao/>)\n\n* **RIBO** - [Royal Inscriptions of Babylonia online](<http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/ribo/>)\n\n* **SAAO** - [State Archives of Assyria online](<http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/>)\n\n* **SUHU** - [The Inscriptions of Suhu online Project](<http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/suhu/>)\n\nThese corpora were all prepared by the Munich Open-access Cuneiform Corpus Initiative (MOCCI) and OIMEA project teams, both led by Karen Radner and Jamie Novotny, and are fully accessible for download in JSON or XML/TEI format in their respective project webpages (see left side-panel on project webpages and look for project-name downloads).\n\nWe also included a separate dataset which includes all the corpora in XML/TEI format.\n\n### Datasets deployment\n\nAll the dataset are taken from their respective project webpages (see left side-panel on project webpages and look for project_name downloads) and are fully accessible from there.\n\nIn our repository the datasets are located in the \"raw_data\" directory. They can also be downloaded from the Github repository using git clone or zip download.\n\n## Project structure\n\n**BiLSTM_input**: \n\n\tContains dictionaries used for transliteration by BiLSTM.\n\n**NMT_input**:\n\n\tContains dictionaries used for natural machine translation.\n\n**akkadian.egg-info**:\n\n\tInformation and settings for akkadian python package.\n\n**akkadian**:\n\n\tSources and train's output.\n\n\toutput:\tTrain's output for HMM, MEMM and BiLSTM - mostly pickles.\n\n\t__init__.py: Init script for akkadian python package.
