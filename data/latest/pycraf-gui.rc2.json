JÃ³zsa\n- *User manual:* `stable <https://bwinkel.github.io/pycraf/gui/>`__ |\n  `developer <https://bwinkel.github.io/pycraf/latest/gui/>`__\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pycraf-gui.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycraf-gui\n    :alt: PyPI tag\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-blue.svg\n    :target: https://www.github.com/bwinkel/pycraf-gui/blob/master/COPYING\n    :alt: License\n\n.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1244192.svg\n    :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1244192\n    :alt: Zenodo DOI\n\nThe pycraf Python package provides functions and procedures for\nvarious tasks in spectrum-management compatibility studies. A typical example\nwould be to calculate the interference levels at a radio telescope produced\nfrom a radio broadcasting tower. This package, `pycraf-gui` contains a\nsimple graphical user interface, which can be used to do path attenuation\ncalculations.\n\nReleases are `registered on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycraf>`_,\nand development is occurring at the\n`project's github page <http://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/>`_.\n\nProject Status\n==============\n\n.. image:: https://dev.azure.com/bwinkel78/Benjamin-Winkel-Projects/_apis/build/status/bwinkel.pycraf-gui?repoName=bwinkel%2Fpycraf-gui&branchName=master\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/bwinkel78/Benjamin-Winkel-Projects/_build?definitionId=4\n    :alt: Pycrafs's CI Status on Azure Pipelines\n\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nStarting pycraf-gui\n-------------------\n\nAfter installation, you can run::\n\n  pycraf-gui\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nSeveral licenses apply; see the `license directory <https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/licenses/>`_ in the `pycraf <https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf>`_ repository. The pycraf and pycraf-gui Python packages\nitself are published under `GPL v3 <https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/licenses/COPYING>`_, an open-source license.\n\nFor some of the functionality provided in pycraf, data files provided by the\nITU are necessary. For example, the atmospheric model in the *pycraf.atm*\nsubpackage implements the algorithm described in `ITU-R Recommendation P.676 <https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.676-10-201309-S/en>`_.\nAnnex 1 of this Recommendation makes use of spectroscopic information of the\noxygen and water vapour lines given in Tables 1 and 2 of P.676. Another\nexample are the radiometeorological data files that are distributed alongside\n`ITU-R Rec. P.452-16 <https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.452-16-201507-I/en>`_\n\nITU kindly gave us permission to include data files into pycraf that are\ndistributed with the Recommendations on the ITU servers. This makes it possible\nto just use pycraf without the need to manually download necessary data files.\nHowever, these data files are not free for commercial use. For details, please\nsee the `LICENSE.ITU <https://www.github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/licenses/LICENSE.ITU>`_ file.\n\nSome of the examples/images in the pycraf documentation and tutorial notebooks\nmake use of `Copernicus <https://www.copernicus.eu/en>`_ data. For these, the\nconditions in `COPERNICUS.EU <https://www.github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/COPERNICUS.EU>`_ apply.\n\nSince pycraf uses the `Astropy Package Template <https://github.com/astropy/package-template>`_ for packaging, we also refer to the associated  `license <https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/licenses/LICENSE_ASTROPY_PACKAGE_TEMPLATE.rst>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nWe strongly recommend to use the `Anaconda Python distribution\n<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_, as it allows to download `pycraf`\nbinaries for all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows). After installing\nAnaconda/Miniconda, one can use the `conda` package manager to install it::\n\n    conda install pycraf pycraf-gui -c conda-forge\n\nOf course, it is always a good idea to do this in its own environment, such\nthat you don't mess up with your standard environment, e.g.::\n\n    conda create -n pycraf-env python=3.9 pycraf pycraf-gui\n\nIf you don't like Anaconda, the easiest way to install pycraf is via pip::\n\n    pip install pycraf pycraf-gui\n\nThe installation is also possible from source. Download the tar.gz-file,\nextract (or clone from GitHub) and simply execute::\n\n    python -m pip install .\n\nFor further details, we refer to the online documention `installation\ninstructions <https://bwinkel.github.io/pycraf/install.html>`_. It also\nincludes some hints for running pycraf on Windows or MacOS. Older versions\nof the packages may work, but no support will be provided.\n\nSRTM data\n---------\n\nTo make full use of the path attenuation calculations provided by pycraf\n(implements `ITU-R Rec. P.452 <https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.452-16-201507-I/en>`_), we recommend to use NASA's\n`Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) <https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/>`_\ndata for height-profile generation. pycraf can work with so-called *.hgt*\nfiles, a very simple binary format. Each *.hgt* file, a so-called tile, just\ncontains 1201x1201 16-bit integers. From the file naming scheme, one can infer\nthe associated coordinates. Most tiles contain one square-degree.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide SRTM data as part of the package, due to the\nlarge file sizes and legal reasons. But once you downloaded the necessary\ntiles (all or only a subset appropriate for your region), simply define the\nenvironment variable *SRTMDATA*, let it point to the folder containing the\ntiles, and pycraf will find the files when it is imported from Python.\n\nOn windows::\n\n    set SRTMDATA=C:\\[path-to-srtm]\\\n\nOn Linux/MacOS (sh-like)::\n\n    export SRTMDATA=[path-to-srtm]/\n\nThere is also the possibility to change the path to the SRTM directory during\nrun-time (see documentation).\n\nAcknowledgments\n===============\nWe are very grateful for the kind support from ITU study groups and ITU's\nlegal department.\n\nThis code is makes use of the excellent work provided by the\n`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_ community. pycraf uses the Astropy package and also the\n`Astropy Package Template <https://github.com/astropy/package-template>`_\nfor the packaging.\n\nWho do I talk to?\n=================\n\nIf you encounter any problems or have questions, do not hesitate to raise an\nissue or make a pull request. Moreover, you can contact the devs directly:\n\n- *bwinkel@mpifr.de*\n",
