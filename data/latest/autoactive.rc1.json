    "description": "The AutoActive Python package is a set of classes used to read and write aaz files. The aaz file type is \na common filetype used in the AutoActive Research Enviroment. The overall goal of the AutoActive Research\nEnviroment is to ease the analysis and development of machine learning models using data from multiple types \nof sensors.\n\nThe AutoActive Research Enviroment consists of Activity Presenter, AutoActive Python package and AutoActive Matlab toolbox.\nActivity Presenter is a graphical user interface which makes it easy to synchronize, visualise and organise data\nfrom multiple sensors, while the overall goal of the AutoActive Python package and the AutoActive Matlab toolbox is to make\nit possible to import the preprocessed data into Python or Matlab where you can utilse all the powerfull algorithms \nalready implemented.The AutoActive Python package also makes it possible to write the results back to aaz files, and thereby,\nalso visualising the results in Activity Presenter.\n\nMore information about the AutoActive Research Enviroment (ARE) and the aaz file type is available here:\nhttps://github.com/SINTEF/AutoActive-ActivityPresenter\n\n# License\nApache License Version 2.0\n\n# Installation\nTo use the AutoActive Python package you need to clone this repository and import it into\nyour projects of intereset.\n\n# Examples\nThere are today two example files in the repository, where the first is an example script to shown how to\ncreate a new aaz file and write it to a file. This file is named write_archive_sine.py and is located\nin the example folder. The second example is an example script to show how to \nread data from an aaz file. This file is also located in the example folder and is named read_archive_sine.py\nBefore running read_archive_sine.py you can create an aaz file with write_archive_sine.py\n\n# Coding style / guidelines\nIf you whish to contribute to the project please follow these guidelines:\n- use_lower_case_with_underscores_naming for everything except Classes\n- For classes UseCamelCase\n- Remove unused code, don't comment out, you have git for this\n- Use the black formatter (https://pypi.org/project/black/) to format you code.\n\n\n# TODO\nThere are a couple of pressing issues\n\t1. Session Object returned from ArchiveReader should be immutable\n\t2. Implement error handling\n\t3. Handle Gaitup and Catapult imports as these are very common sensors used in sports.\n\n\n\n",
