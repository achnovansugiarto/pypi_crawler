Account information to access\nthe Avatax dashboard can be obtained through the Avalara website here:\nhttps://www.avalara.com/products/calculations.html\n\nOnce configured, the module operates in the background and performs\ncalculations and reporting seamlessly to the AvaTax server.\n\nThis guide includes instructions for the following elements:\n\n- Activating your organization's AvaTax account and downloading the product\n- Entering the AvaTax credentials into your Odoo database and configuring it\n  to use AvaTax services and features within Odoo\n\nNote: Test the module before deploying in live environment.\nAll changes to the AvaTax settings must be performed by a user with\nadministrative access rights.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBefore installing the Avatax app, the Avalara Python client\nmust be installed in your system.\nIt is available at https://pypi.org/project/Avalara.\n\nTypically it can be installed in your system usin ``pip``::\n\n    pip3 install Avalara\n\nThe base app, ``account_Avatax``, adds Avatax support to Customer Invoices.\nInthe official app store: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/account_avatax/\n\nThe ``account_avatax_sale`` extension adds support to Quotations / Sales Orders.\nInthe official app store: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/account_avatax_sale/\n\nIn most cases you will want to download and install both modules.\n\nTo install the Avatax app:\n\n- Download the AvaTax modules\n- Extract the downloaded files\n- Upload the extracted directories into your Odoo module/addons directory\n- Log into Odoo as an Administrator and enable the Developer Mode, in 'Settings'\n- Navigate to 'Apps', select the 'Update Apps List' menu, to have the new apps listed.\n- In the Apps list, search for 'AvaTax'\n- Click on the Install button. If available, the ``account_avatax_sale`` module will\n  also be installed automatically.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure an Odoo company to use Avatax, follow these steps.\nNote tha tsome of them might be configured out of the box\nfor the Odoo default company.\n\n1.

If no address is assigned to the warehouse\n  the module will automatically use the address of the company as its origin.\n  Location code will automatically populate with the warehouse code\n  but can be modified if needed.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nThe development of this module was driven by US companies to compute Sales Tax.\n\nHowever the Avatax service supports more use cases, that could be added:\n\n- Add support to EU VAT\n- Add support to US Use Tax on Purchases / vendor Bills\n\nOther improvements that could be added:\n\n- Detect and warn if customers State is not a nexus available for the current account\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/issues/new?body=module:%20account_avatax%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Open Source Integrators\n* Fabrice Henrion\n* Sodexis\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo SA\n\n  * Fabrice Henrion\n\n* Open Source Integrators (https://opensourceintegrators.com)\n\n  * Daniel Reis <dreis@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Bhavesh Odedra <bodedra@opensourceintegrators.com>\n  * Sandip Mangukiya <smangukiya@opensourceintegrators.com>\n\n* Serpent CS\n\n  * Murtuza Saleh\n\n* Sodexis\n\n  * Atchuthan Ubendran\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module was originally developed by Fabrice Henrion at Odoo SA,\nand maintained up to version 11.\n\nFor version 12, Fabrice invited partners to migrate this modules to\nlater version, and maintain it.\n\nOpen Source Integrators performed the migration to Odoo 12\n, and later added support for the more up to date REST API\n, alongside with the legacy SOAP API.\n\nWith the addition of the REST API, a deep refactor was introduced,\nchanging the tax calculation approach, from just setting the total\ntax amount, to instead adding the tax rates to each document line\nand then having Odoo do all the other computations.\n\nFor Odoo 13, the legacy SOAP support was supported, and\nadditional refactoring was done to contribute the module\nto the Odoo Community Association.\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-dreispt| image:: https://github.com/dreispt.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/dreispt\n    :alt: dreispt\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-dreispt| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-fiscal-rule <https://github.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/tree/15.0/account_avatax>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
