    "description": "PAHFIT\n======\n\n``PAHFIT`` is a decomposition model and tool for astronomical infrared spectra, focusing on dust and gas emission features from the interstellar medium (see `Smith, J.D.T., Draine B.T., et al., 2007, ApJ, 656, 770 <http://tir.astro.utoledo.edu/jdsmith/research/pahfit.php>`_).\n\nThis package provides an updated python implementation of ``PAHFIT``.  While the original versions of ``PAHFIT`` (``v1.x``) were written in IDL and focused mainly on Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic observations, the newer python-based versions (``>=v2.0``) will expand instrument coverage to other existing (e.g., AKARI) and planned (e.g., JWST) facilities, and will offer a more flexible modeling framework suitable for modeling a wider range of astrophysical sources.\n\nBased on and inspired by the IDL code ``PAHFIT`` by JD Smith and Bruce Draine.\n\nBuild checks/status\n-------------------\n\n.. image:: http://readthedocs.org/projects/pahfit/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://dust-extinction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/PAHFIT/pahfit/workflows/Python%20Tests/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/PAHFIT/pahfit/actions/\n   :alt: Test Status\n\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/PAHFIT/pahfit/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/PAHFIT/pahfit\n   :alt: Test Coverage Status\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/python/g/PAHFIT/pahfit.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18\n   :target: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/PAHFIT/pahfit/context:python\n   :alt: LGTM Status\n\n.. image:: https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/01a75df3279e45609906c1f28a4ca867\n   :target: https://www.codacy.com/gh/PAHFIT/pahfit?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=PAHFIT/pahfit&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade\n   :alt: Codacy Status\n\nPackaging\n---------\n\n.. image:: http://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-AstroPy-orange.svg?style=flat\n    :target: http://www.astropy.org\n    :alt: Powered by Astropy Badge\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nHosted by readthedocs: <http://pahfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>\n\nIn Development!\n---------------\n\nThis code is currently in active development.\nContributions welcome (see below).\n\nContributors\n------------\n* Thomas Lai\n* Alexandros Maragkoudakis\n* J.D.

No, really.\n\nThere may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not\nready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good\nenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?\n\nWe assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at\nall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source\nprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code\nisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's\ntrying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those\nmistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.\n\nBeing an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can\nhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the\nproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution\nprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as\na whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see\nthe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.\n\n*This disclaimer was originally written by\n`Adrienne Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a\n`PyCon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo>`_, and was adapted by\npahfit based on its use in the README file for the\n`MetPy project <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`_.*\n\n.. _AstroPy: https://www.astropy.org/\n.. _contributing: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#contributing\n.. _developer: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#developer-documentation\n.. _Astropy Code of Conduct:  https://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct\n\n\n",
