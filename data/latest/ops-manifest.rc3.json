In some cases the project's distribution uses different\nmeans of indicating a need for replacement.\n\nFor example, the following reference from [vsphere-cloud-controller-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/blob/master/releases/v1.23/vsphere-cloud-controller-manager.yaml#L11-L24)\ngives the consumer of this yaml an indication there should be usernames and passwords set\nin the Secret object.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: vsphere-cloud-secret\n  labels:\n    vsphere-cpi-infra: secret\n    component: cloud-controller-manager\n  namespace: kube-system\n  # NOTE: this is just an example configuration, update with real values based on your environment\nstringData:\n  10.0.0.1.username: \"<ENTER_YOUR_VCENTER_USERNAME>\"\n  10.0.0.1.password: \"<ENTER_YOUR_VCENTER_PASSWORD>\"\n  1.2.3.4.username: \"<ENTER_YOUR_VCENTER_USERNAME>\"\n  1.2.3.4.password: \"<ENTER_YOUR_VCENTER_PASSWORD>\"\n```\n\nAutomation tools like a juju charm will need to read these yaml manifest files, manipulate\nits content, and deploy those manifests when any of the **configurable** data is changed.\n\n\n## Supporting Multiple Releases\nLikewise, the projects which release reference manifest files, will also release versions\nof manifests. It's possible for a charm to load all the supported manifest files into a \nfolder structure such the charm supports multiple releases. This library supports this \nrequirements by having the charm store upstream manifest files unchanged in a folder \nstructure like this:\n\n```\n<base_path>\n├── version                  - a file containing the default version\n├── manifests                - a folder containing all the releases\n│   ├── v1.1.10              - a folder matching a configurable version\n│   │   ├── manifest-1.yaml  - any file with a `.yaml` file type\n│   │   └── manifest-2.yaml\n│   ├── v1.1.11\n│   │   ├── manifest-1.yaml\n│   │   └── manifest-2.yaml\n│   │   └── manifest-3.yaml\n```\n\nKey file-heirarchy requirements\n-------------------------------\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **$base_path** | A single charm can support multiple manifest releases\n| **version**    | A text file indicating to the library which manifest version is the default when the 'release' config is unspecified |\n| **manifests**  | A folder containing the individual release manifest folders |\n| **$release**   | A folder containing the yaml files of the specific release |\n\n## Sample Usage\n\nOnce your charm includes the above manifest file hierarchy, your charm will need to define the\nmutations the library should make to the manifests. \n\n```python\nfrom ops.manifests import Collector, Manifests, ManifestLabel, ConfigRegistry\n\nclass ExampleApp(Manifests):\n    def __init__(self, charm, charm_config):\n        manipulations = [\n            ManifestLabel(self),\n            ConfigRegistry(self),\n            UpdateSecret(self),\n        ]\n        super().__init__(\"example\", charm.model, \"upstream/example\", manipulations)\n        self.charm_config = charm_config\n\n    @property\n    def config(self) -> Dict:\n        \"\"\"Returns config mapped from charm config and joined relations.\"\"\"\n        config = dict(**self.charm_config)\n\n        for key, value in dict(**config).items():\n            if value == \"\" or value is None:\n                del config[key]  # blank out keys not currently set to something\n\n        config[\"release\"] = config.pop(\"example-release\", None)\n        return config\n\n\nclass ExampleCharm(CharmBase):\n    def __init__(self, *args):\n        super().__init__(*args)\n\n        # collection of ManifestImpls\n        self.collector = Collector(ExampleApp(self, self.config))\n\n        # Register actions callbacks\n        self.framework.observe(self.on.list_versions_action, self._list_versions)\n        \n        # Register update status callbacks\n        self.framework.observe(self.on.update_status, self._update_status)\n    \n    def _list_versions(self, event):\n        self.collector.list_versions(event)\n\n    def _update_status(self, _):\n        unready = self.collector.unready\n        if unready:\n            self.unit.status = WaitingStatus(\", \".join(unready))\n        else:\n            self.unit.status = ActiveStatus(\"Ready\")\n            self.unit.set_workload_version(self.collector.short_version)\n            self.app.status = ActiveStatus(self.collector.long_version)\n        \n```\n\n## Manifests\n\nThis class provides the following functions:\n1) Integration with lightkube to create/read/update/delete resources into the cluster\n2) Provides a means to select a manifest release\n3) Loads manifest files from a known file hierarchy specific to a release\n4) Manipulates resource objects of a specific release\n5) Provides comparisons between the installed resources and expected resources\n6) Provides user listing of available releases\n\n### Creating a Manifest Impl\nIt's expected that the developer create a `Manifest` impl -- a derived class -- that implements\none property -- `config`.  This property provides some basic requirements to the\nManifest parent class and gives context for each custom `Manipulation` to act on \nrelation or config data.\n\n```python\n    @property\n    def config(self) -> Dict:\n        \"\"\"Returns config mapped from charm config and joined relations.\"\"\"\n```\n\n#### Expected `config` key mappings\n* `release` \n    * optional `str` which identifies which release of the manifest to choose.\n    * defaults to `None` which will select the `default_release` if available.\n    * if `default_release` isn't found, the latest release is chosen.\n* `image-registry`\n    * optional `str` which will be used by the `ConfigRegistry` manipulation\n    * defaults to `None` which uses the resources built-in registry location\n    * if specified, will replace the text up to the first `/` with its contents\n\n\n### Cluster CRUD methods\n* `status()` \n    * queries all in cluster resources associated with the current release which\n      has a `.status.conditions` attribute.\n* `installed_resources()`\n    * queries all in cluster resources associated with the current release which \n      is installed.\n* `labelled_resources()`\n    * queries all in cluster resources associated with the charm and manifest in general\n      which is installed.\n    * this can be compared with the `resources` property to look for extra resources \n      installed which are no longer necessary.\n* `apply_manifests()`\n    * applies all resources from the current release into the cluster.\n    * resources are force applied, overwriting existing resources.\n* `apply_resources(*resources)` and `apply_resource(...)`\n    * applies itemized resources into the cluster.\n    * resources are force applied, overwriting existing resources.\n* `delete_manifests(...)`\n    * will delete all current release resources from the cluster\n    * see `delete_resources` for keyword arguments\n* `delete_resources(...)`\n    * delete a specified set of resources from the cluster with options to \n      seamlessly handle certain failures.\n* `delete_resource(...)`\n    * alias to `delete_resources` for when reading clarity demands only deleting\n      one resource.\n\n## Collector\n\nThis class provides a native collection for operating collectively on\nthe manifests within a single charm.  It provides methods for responding to \n* action list-versions\n* action scrub-resources\n* action list-resources\n* action apply-missing-resources\n* querying the collective versions (short and long types)\n* listing which resources have a non-active status\n\nTo integrate into an [ops charm](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/ops), for each \nreleased application the charm manages, create a new `Manifests` impl, \nand add an instance of it to a `Collector`.\n\n```python\nclass AlternateApp(Manifests):\n    def __init__(self, charm, charm_config):\n        super().__init__(\"alternate\", charm.model, \"upstream/example\")\n        self.charm_config = charm_config\n\n\n    @property\n    def config(self) -> Dict:\n        \"\"\"Returns config mapped from charm config and joined relations.\"\"\"\n        config = dict(**self.charm_config)\n\n        for key, value in dict(**config).items():\n            if value == \"\" or value is None:\n                del config[key]  # blank out keys not currently set to something\n\n        config[\"release\"] = config.pop(\"alternate-release\", None)\n        return config\n\n\nclass ExampleCharm(CharmBase):\n    def __init__(self, *args):\n        ...\n        # collection of ManifestImpls\n        self.collector = Collector(\n            ExampleApp(self, self.config), \n            AlternateApp(self, self.config),\n        )\n```\n\n\n## Manipulations\n\n### Patching a manifest resource\nSome resources already exist within the manifest, and just need to be updated.\n\n#### Built in Patchers\n* `ManifestLabel` \n  * adds to each resource's `metadata.labels` the following:\n     1) `juju.io/application: manifests.app_name`\n     2) `juju.io/manifest: manifests.name`\n     3) `juju.io/manifest-version: <manifests.name>-<version>`\n\n* `ConfigRegistry`\n  * updates the image registry of every `Pod`, `DaemonSet`, `Deployment`, and\n    `StatefulSet` from the `image-registry` config item in the config\n    properties `Dict`.\n  * If the charm doesn't wish to alter the config, ensure nothing exists\n    in the `image-registry`.\n\n* `update_toleration` \n  * not officially a patcher, but can be used by a custom Patcher\n    to adjust tolerations on `Pod`, `DaemonSet`, `Deployment`, and `StatefulSet`\n    resources.\n\n### Adding a manifest resource\nSome resources do not exist in the release manifest and must be added. The `Addition` manipulations are added\nbefore the rest of the `Patch` manipulations are applied.\n\n#### Built in Adders\n* `CreateNamespace` - Creates a namespace resource using either the manifest's default namespace or \n                      an argument passed in to the constructor of this class. \n\n### Subtracting a manifest resource\nSome manifest resources are not needed and must be removed. The `Subtraction` manipulations are added\nbefore the rest of the `Patch` manipulations are applied.\n\n#### Built in Subtractors\n* `SubtractEq` - Subtracts a manifest resource equal to the resource passed in as an argument. Resources are considered \n                 equal if they have the same kind, name, and namespace.\n\n### Custom Manipulations\nOf course the built-ins will not be enough, so your charm may extend its own manipulations by defining\nnew objects which inherit from either `Patch` or `Addition`.\n.. _`changelog`:\n\n=========\nChangelog\n=========\n\nVersions follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``).\n\nBackward incompatible (breaking) changes will only be introduced in major versions\n\n\nops-lib-manifest 1.0.0 (2022-12-14)\n=========================\n\nIssues Resolved\n* [LP#1999427](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1999427)\n    - handles non-api errors from the client which are represented\n      as an http error response without json content.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n* no longer are `lightkube.core.exceptions.ApiError`s raised on the following methods:\n   * Manifest.status\n   * Manifest.installed_resources\n   * Manifest.apply_manifest\n   * Manifest.delete_manifest\n   * Manifest.apply_resources\n   * Manifest.delete_resources\n\n    instead a more generic exception `ManifestClientError` is raised.\n\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.
