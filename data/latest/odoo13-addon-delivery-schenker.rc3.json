Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping methods* and create a new one.\n#. Choose *DB Schenker* as provider.\n#. Configure the service parameters according to your contract considerations.\n#. Choose a delivery product and a default packaging. This is mandatory for the booking\n   request as it needs the packaging code.\n\nTo make tests, set the carrier environment to test from the smart button. Don't forget\nto set it to production once you're ready to use the delivery method!\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThese are the operations possible with this module:\n\nPlace shipping bookings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#. When the picking is validated, the shipping will be booked at Schenker.\n#. With the response, we'll receive the delivery tracking number and the pdf label in a\n   chatter message and it will be kept as attachment to the document.\n#. You can manage packages number either with the proper Odoo workflows or with the\n   package number field available in the *Additional Info* tab. You'll get as many\n   labels as declared packages.\n\nCancel bookings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#. As in other carriers, we can cancel the shipping after the picking is done. To do\n   so, go to *Additional Info* tab and click on the *Cancel* action on the side of the\n   tracking number.\n#. We can generate a new shipping if necessary.\n\nGet labels\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#. If by chance we delete the generated labels, we can obtain them again hitting the\n   *Schenker Label* buttons in the header of the picking form.\n\nTracking\n~~~~~~~~\n\n#. The module is integrated with `delivery_state` to be able to get the tracking info\n   directly from the DB Schenker API.\n#. To do so, go to a picking shipped with Schenker. In the *Additional Info* tab you'll\n   find an action button to *Update tracking state* so the state will be updated from\n   the Schenker API.\n\nDebugging\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe API calls and responses are tracked in two special fields in the picking that can\nbe viewed by technical users. You can also log them in as `ir.logging` records setting\nthe carrier debug on from the smart button.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* There's no dummy access key to test API calls so no tests can be performed.\n* The test booking and shipping APIs databases aren't connected so it isn't possible to\n  perform trackings on test mode.\n* Only land shipping is implemented, although the module is prepared for extend to\n  air and ocean just considering the mandatory request fields for those methods.\n  Some additional adaptations could be needed (e.g.: origin and destination airport,\n  port) anyway.\n* Only volume is supported as a measure unit and with the limitations of Odoo itself. To\n  enjoy a full fledged volume support, install and configure the OCA’s\n  `stock_quant_package_dimension` module and its dependencies. The connector is ready to\n  make use of their volume computations.\n* It’d be needed to extend the method to support Schenker measure units such as  loading\n  pieces or pallet space.\n* Some more booking features aren’t yet supported although can be extended in the\n  future. Some of those, although the complete list would be really extensive:\n\n  * Dangerous goods.\n  * Driver pre-advise.\n  * Transport temperature.\n  * Customs clearance.\n  * Cargo insurance.\n  * Cash on delivery.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/issues/new?body=module:%20delivery_schenker%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * David Vidal\n\n* `Studio73 <https://www.studio73.es>`_:\n\n  * Ethan Hildick\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/delivery-carrier <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/tree/13.0/delivery_schenker>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
