The files list all scenario-specific parameters but can fall back to defaults set [here](https://github.com/NREL/hive/blob/main/nrel/hive/resources/defaults/hive_config.yaml).\n\nScenario YAML files organize a list of resource files to use as input. If a file resource is listed which doesn't resolve to a local file path, HIVE will search for a default resource [here](nrel/hive/resources). By default, HIVE expects file resources stored in a directory matching their resource type. For example, using the [default Denver scenario](nrel/hive/resources/scenarios/denver_downtown/denver_demo.yaml):\n\n```yaml\n...\ninput:\n  vehicles_file: denver_demo_vehicles.csv  # vehicles/denver_demo_vehicles.csv\n  requests_file: denver_demo_requests.csv  # requests/denver_demo_requests.csv\n  bases_file: denver_demo_bases.csv        # bases/denver_demo_bases.csv\n...\n```\n\nFor a description of file contents and schemas, please read our [technical report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/80682.pdf). Example scenario and resource data can be found [here](nrel/hive/resources).  \n\n## Global configuration\n\nSome values are set by a global configuration file with filename `.hive.yaml`.\nThe defaults are set in the repo [here](nrel/hive/resources/defaults/.hive.yaml).\nIf you want to override any entries in this file, you can create a new one by the same name `.hive.yaml` and place it in your working directory or a parent directory.\nHive will also check your base user directory for this file (aka `~/.hive.yaml`).\nThis can be useful if you would like to reduce the output files or change the default output base directory (for example, to something like `~/hive/output`).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nHIVE attempts to rely on as few dependencies as possible. For the most part, these dependencies are obvious choices from the open-source Python analysis ecosystem:\n\n- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) (bipartite matching optimization)\n- [numpy](https://numpy.org) (linear interpolation of energy lookup tables)\n- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (file IO)\n- [networkx](https://networkx.org) (underlying network model)\n- [pyyaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)\n- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) (command line progress bars)\n\nBeyond these, HIVE uses Uber H3, a geospatial index which HIVE uses for positioning and search, and MagicStack Immutables, which provides the implementation of an immutable Map to replace the standard Python `Dict` type. The Returns library provides Python-approximations for functional containers. Links provided here:\n\n- [h3](https://github.com/uber/h3) (spatial index)\n- [immutables](https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables) ([HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) implementation for \"immutable dict\")\n- [returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns) (functional containers)\n\n## Developer documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found [here](https://readthedocs.org/nrel-hive).\n\n## Why HIVE?\n\nWhen the Mobility, Behavior, and Advanced Powertrains group began looking to answer questions related to fleet sizing, charging infrastructure, and dynamic energy pricing, we could not find a simulator which was right-sized for our research questions. Most modern models for mobility services have a large barrier-to-entry due to the complex interactions of mode choice, economics, and model tuning required to use the leading micro and mesoscopic transportation models (BEAM, POLARIS, MATSim, SUMO, AMoDeus, etc.). Additionally, they have heavyweight technical infrastructure demands where deployment of these models requires a specialized team. HIVE attempts to fill a gap for researchers seeking to study the economic and energy impacts of autonomous ride hail fleets by providing the following feature set:\n\n- agent-based model (ABM)\n- data-driven control interfaces for Model-Predicted Control and Reinforcement Learning research\n- easy integration/co-simulation (can be called alongside other software tools)\n- dynamic dispatch, trip energy, routing, and economics\n- simple to define/share scenarios via configuration files and simulation snapshots\n- 100% Python (v 3.7) code with a small(ish) set of dependencies and well-documented code\n\nHIVE is _not_ a fully-featured [Activity-Based Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting#Activity-based_models), does _not_ simulate all vehicles on the network, and does not simulate congestion. It also assumes demand is fixed. If these assumptions are too strong for your research question, then one of the other mesoscopic models capable of ridehail simulation may be a more appropriate fit. The following (opinionated) chart attempts to compare features of HIVE against LBNL's BEAM and ANL's POLARIS models.\n\n| feature                                            | HIVE       | BEAM      | POLARIS |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |\n| Agent-Based Ridehail Model                         | :honeybee: | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Designed for large-scale inputs                    | :honeybee: | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Integrates with NREL energy models                 | :honeybee: | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Charging infrastructure & charge events            | :honeybee: | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Service pricing and income model                   | :honeybee: | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Data-driven ridehail dispatcher                    | :honeybee: |           |         |\n| Does not require socio-demographic data            | :honeybee: |           |         |\n| Built-in example scenario                          | :honeybee: | :red_car: |         |\n| Written entirely in Python, installed via pip      | :honeybee: |           |         |\n| Activity-Based Demand Model                        |            | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Dynamic demand using behavioral models             |            | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Robust assignment of population demographics       |            | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Supports broad set of travel modes                 |            | :red_car: | :train: |\n| Endogenous traffic congestion modeling             |            | :red_car: | :train: |\n\n## Looking at a default scenario\n\n![Map of Denver Downtown](docs/source/_static/denver_demo.jpg?raw=true)\n\nRunning HIVE takes one argument, which is a configuration file. Hive comes packaged with a demo scenario for Downtown Denver, located at `hive/resources/scenarios/denver_demo.yaml`. This file names the inputs and the configuration Parameters for running HIVE.\n\nthe Denver demo scenario is configured to log output to a folder named `denver_demo_outputs` which is also tagged with a timestamp. These output files can be parsed by Pandas (for Pandas > 0.19.0):\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n# log files store JSON rows, like a document store\noutput_file = \"~/hive/output/denver_demo_2021-02-08_11-00-07/state.log\"\npd.read_json(output_file, lines=True)\n```\n\nBy default, these outputs are generated:\n\nfile name                        | file type | description\n-------------------------------- | --------- | -----------\n\\<config\\>.yaml                  | YAML      | the input configuration serialized (can be read back by HIVE)\nrun.log                          | text      | console log output\nevent.log                        | JSON rows | events that occur, such as vehicle movement, pickup + dropoff events, etc\ninstruction.log                  | JSON rows | instructions sent from dispatcher to drivers\nstate.log                        | JSON rows | entity states at every time step\nstation_capacities.csv           | CSV       | energy load capacity for each station\nsummary_stats.json               | JSON      | summary stats as displayed in run.log but in JSON format\ntime_step_stats_{$FLEET|all}.csv | CSV       | aggregated data across a fleet (or all fleets) by time step\n\nRunning this scenario should also feed some logging into the console.\nFirst, HIVE announces where it is loading configuration from (1).\nIt then dumps the global and scenario configuration to the console (2).\nFinally, after around 65 lines, it begins running the simulation with a progress bar (3).\nAfter, it prints the summary stats to the console and exits (4).\n\n```console\nINFO\n         ##     ##  ####  ##     ##  #######\n         ##     ##   ##   ##     ##  ##\n         #########   ##   ##     ##  ######\n         ##     ##   ##    ##   ##   ##\n         ##     ##  ####     ###     #######\n\n                         .'
