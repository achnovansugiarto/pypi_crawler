    "description": "# nip05er\n\nHigh five users by adding them to `nostr.json` which is used to validate their nip05 address if it matches `user@your.domain`. The term \"nip05er\" is an abbreviation of \"nip05 user.\"\n\n* This works withou any necessary web-interface or separate database. The user is never required to fill out a separate form. All they do is set up their nip-05 the way they want to, in the app of their choice. The script will record which users registered a name and ensure the user keeps that name. All of the concerns about the UX remain in the nostr client and there is no additional fees for shorter names. It's a first come first serve basis.\n\n* The script operates on an nostr.json file in-place, and maintains all of your manual modifications. However, you should make regular backups and periodically review the resulting nostr.json, just in-case there are any unforseen issues with this lightly tested script that you got for free. ðŸ™ƒ\n\n## reports\n\nHelper script to show all NIP-1984 reports on local users by local users.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install bleetube-nip05er\n```\n\n## configure secrets\n\nWe automatically read database connection parameters from an environment file named `.env` by default:\n\n```bash\nDB_HOST=/var/run/postgresql\nDB_PORT=5432\nDB_NAME=nostream\nDB_USER=nostream\nDB_PASSWORD='hunter2'\nRELAY_DOMAIN=bitcoiner.social\nNIP05ER_JSON=/var/www/html/.well-known/nostr.json\nNIP05ER_DATA=/var/cache/nip05er\nNIP05ER_LOG_PATH=/var/log/nip05er.log\n```\n\nThe last couple variables are unique to this script. The rest overlap with what you would already have configured in a docker-compose environment file.\n\n## running\n\n```bash\nnip05er update\n```\n\n## troubleshooting\n\nYou can have the script dump all the environment variables:\n\n```bash\nnip05er update --showvars\n```\n\n## Development\n\nClone the repo and install dependencies into a local virtual environment:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com/bleetube/nip05er\ncd nip05er\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --editable .\nnip05er update\nreports show\n```\n\ntodo:\n\n- Remove names if they no longer appear in the user's profile.\n- We should also check external relays because the client isn't guaranteed to have broadcast the profile to our local relay.\n- When checking external relays, we should use only the most recent event\n",
