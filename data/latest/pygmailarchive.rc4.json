    "description": "pygmailarchive a commandline tool to archive a GMail account to a local Maildir directory.\n\nThis tool is licensed under the \"Simplified BSD License\", see LICENSE for details.\n\npygmailarchive downloads all mails from your GMail account via IMAP, storing them in the same structure\nas they are presented on the IMAP server. This means all your labels and sub-labels will be converted into\nMaildir folders in the destination folder.\n\nYou can exclude certain labels or even a complete label-hierarchy easily. This is useful for people having\nlists or emails that are already archived elsewhere.\n\nSubsequent executions of the tool will download all mails that haven't been fetched so far, the tool keeps\na list of 'already seen mails' along with the Maildir's.\n\nThe main intent is to copy the Mails from gmail to your own machine to archive or backup them.\n\nRequirements:\n * Python 2.7\n * IMAPClient (http://imapclient.freshfoo.com/)\n\nHowto use:\npygmailarchive gmailarchive/\n\nSee pygmailarchive --help for more options",
