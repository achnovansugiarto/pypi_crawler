    "description": "Itsim project creation library\n==============================\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n```shell_session\n[itsim-project-data] $ pip install itsim_project_creation_library\n```\n\nThen in python:\n```python\nfrom itsim_project_creation_library import (\n    feed_processing,\n    gis_processing,\n    log_progress,\n)\n```\n\nYou can also import aliases:\n```python\nfrom itsim_project_creation_library import (\n    feedp,\n    gisp,\n    log_progress,\n)\n```\n\n`log_progress` is just something to print progress on stdout. Same syntax as `print`.\n\nHow to develop on it\n--------------------\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\n\nHow to create a new ItSim project\n=================================\n\nThis guide covers the steps necessary to create a new project in the ItSim application. This document is intended for developers and people with skills in Python and data processing. Most of the processing operations are done thanks to the Pandas and GeoPandas libraries.\n\n\nPrerequisites for a new ItSim project\n-------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, to create a new project, we will need:\n- **Feed input data**: Zero, one or several GTFS file(s). In these files we find the description of the transport plan and network.\n- **Geographic Information System (GIS) input data**: Zero, one or several shapefiles (.shp). These files will contain geographical data.\n- A filled-out **project creation form** that contains parameters for the project.\n\n\nProcessing feed input data\n--------------------------\n\nIn this section, we will see how to check feed input data and how to correct the file(s) if required.\n\n### Check validity of a GTFS\n\nFirst, it is necessary to check the validity of the given GTFS with Google's [Feed validator](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator) (for Windows or Linux). Once downloaded, you can execute it and drag & drop your GTFS file into it. The software will check the compatibility of the file with the [GTFS Reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference).\n\nAfter a while, you will get the validity report displayed in your web browser. Then, you will have to check the report and its error and warning messages. Note that errors will most likely cause problems when loading the GTFS into ItSim. That is the reason why the GTFS must be corrected with a processing script and using some of the processing functions of the ItSim project creation library.\n\nWarnings are less likely to cause problems but it is recommended to check each message to ensure that it will not be harmful to the import.\n\n### Check the GTFS content\n\nAfter checking validity of the GTFS file, we would like to have a better idea of its content. We might ask ourselves many questions:\n- How much routes does the network have?\n- Which transport mode(s) does the network have?\n- Do the routes have geometries (shapes), and are they accurate?\n\nTo visualize the GTFS in software like QGIS, it should be converted to a GeoJSON file. You can convert your GTFS file with the `gtfs_to_geojson` script, using either `pipenv shell` or `pipenv run`.\n\n*Example:*\n\n```shell_session\n[itsim-project-data] $ gtfs_to_geojson -g path/to/mycity/MyCity_GTFS_2020.zip -j path/to/mycity/test.json\n```\n\nOnce it is done, you can import the generated GeoJSON file into QGIS and check its content.\n\n\n### Write a feed processing file\n\nTo correct the GTFS file, create a `gtfs_generator.py` file in a directory that has the name of your project in the `itsm-project-data`'s repository.\n\nHere is an example of how the file should be structured. In this case we are removing shapes of routes and group routes:\n\n```python\nfrom itsim_project_creation_library import feedp, log_progress\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom os import environ\nfrom gtfstk import read_gtfs, write_gtfs\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Initialize paths\n    # path of the local project directory\n    PROJECT_DATA_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent\n    # path of the volume in which the original data is saved\n    ITSIM_DATA_PATH = Path(environ.get('ITSIM_DATA_PATH', '/mnt/systra/G'))\n    # path to the original data folder\n    mycity_path = (\n        ITSIM_DATA_PATH\n        / \"PLT/ZZ_DCME/3_GESTION/7_LE LAB DIGITAL/800_PROJETS/PROJET_20160622_ITSIM/1_TRAVAIL/6_RUN/1_Données d'entrée/ItSim/MyCity\"\n    )\n    # path to the GTFS to use\n    mycity_gtfs_path = mycity_path / 'GTFS' / 'MyCity_GTFS_2020.zip'\n    # output path\n    gtfs_output_path = PROJECT_DATA_PATH / 'mycity-gtfs.zip'\n    # Define bbox\n    bbox = {\n        'north_lat': 48.902192,\n        'south_lat': 48.814099,\n        'west_lon': 2.250824,\n        'east_lon': 2.425232,\n    }\n    # Processing\n    nb_of_steps = 3\n    log_progress(f\"Step 1/{nb_of_steps}: Read GTFS\")\n    feed = read_gtfs(mycity_gtfs_path, dist_units='km')\n    log_progress(f\"Step 2/{nb_of_steps}: Remove shapes\")\n    new_feed = feedp.remove_shapes(feed=feed)\n    log_progress(f\"Step 3/{nb_of_steps}: Group routes\")\n    new_feed = feedp.group_routes(feed=new_feed)\n    # You can add as much operations as required and even yours…\n    write_gtfs(new_feed, gtfs_output_path)\n    log_progress(f\"GTFS file {gtfs_output_path} created!\")\n```\n\n### Operations on the feed\n\nIn this section, you will find all the recurring operations you might need if you have to correct your GTFS.\n\n#### Merge several feeds\n\nItSim can only load one GTFS when creating a new project, but we might be given several. For instance, train lines and bus lines might be split into two distinct GTFS files, simply because bus and train lines are operated by two different companies.\n\nTo import data, we will have to merge these files into one. To do so, we will use the `merge_gtfs()` function. In the following example, GTFS files contained in the directory provided as an argument will be merged in one single GTFS file:\n\n```python\ngtfs_path = \"path/to/feed/folder\"\nfeed = merge_gtfs(origin_gtfs_path=gtfs_path)\n```\n\nIf two elements have the same ID, a suffix is added. It consists of an underscore with a number. An element with the ID `12` will have the ID `12_1` afterwards if there was already an element with the same ID.\n\n\n#### Get a feed sample based on a bounding box\n\nSometimes, we might want to use a sample of a large feed. For instance, we might only have at our disposal a GTFS that covers a full region or country. However, we might only want to use data that cover a single city of this region.\n\nTo get a sample from a large feed, the first thing we will have to do is to define a bounding box. To help you define your bounding box, you can [use this website](http://bboxfinder.com).\n\nThen, use `get_feed_sample_from_bbox()` function to only keep a sample of the given feed, like in the following example:\n\n```python\ngtfs_path = \"path/to/feed/folder/feed.zip\"\nfeed = read_gtfs(gtfs_path, dist_units='km')\nbbox = {\n    'north_lat': 48.902192,\n    'south_lat': 48.814099,\n    'west_lon': 2.250824,\n    'east_lon': 2.425232,\n}\nfeed = feedp.get_feed_sample_from_bbox(feed=feed, bbox=bbox)\n```\n\nAt first, this function will detect the stops that are located in the zone defined by the bounding box. Then, it will keep only the routes that have **all their stops** in the zone.\n\n#### Filter routes based on transport modes\n\nSometimes, we would like to work with only one or several specific transport mode(s). For example, we would like to work only on the Bus network, but the original feed also contains Light rail and Rail routes. The function `route_types_filter()` will help you do that.\n\nIn this example, we would like to remove Light rail (`0`) and Rail (`2`) routes:\n\n```python\ngtfs_path = \"path/to/feed/folder/feed.zip\"\nfeed = read_gtfs(gtfs_path, dist_units='km')\nroute_types = [0, 2]\nnew_feed = feedp.route_types_filter(feed=feed, route_types=route_types, filter_type='remove'):\n```\n\nNote that the `filter_type` could be `'keep'` or `'remove'`.\n\nThe transport modes are indicated using the `route_type` values described in the [GTFS Reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#routestxt).\n\n#### Filter routes based on short names\n\n`remove_routes_from_feed_by_short_names()`\n\n```python\nfeed, routes_to_remove_short_names=['bad route A', 'bad route B']\nnew_feed = feedp.remove_routes_from_feed_by_short_names(feed, routes_to_remove_short_names)\n```\n\n#### Regroup routes\n\nIn our GTFS, some patterns that describe the same route could be dispatched between several ones. This case is not always obvious to detect but the fact that many routes have the same name in your network could be a clue.\nYou can also check by comparing your network with its map given by the operator. Google is your friend! (or not).\n\nTo group the routes by name, we can use the `group_routes()` function as follow:\n\n```python\ngtfs_path = \"path/to/feed/folder/feed.zip\"\nfeed = read_gtfs(gtfs_path, dist_units='km')\nnew_feed = feedp.group_routes(feed=feed)\n```\n\n#### Remove geometries (shapes)\n\nSometimes, shapes that are given in our GTFS might be only made of straight lines or be completely inaccurate. In this case, we most likely want to regenerate these shapes when the project is imported in ItSim. To enable ItSim to generate shapes for lines that will follow the road network (buses…), we will have to remove all the existing shapes.\n\nTo do so, we will use the `remove_shapes()` function. In this example, the geometries will be removed from the given feed.\n\n```python\ngtfs_path = \"path/to/feed/folder/feed.zip\"\nfeed = read_gtfs(gtfs_path, dist_units='km')\nnew_feed = feedp.remove_shapes(feed=feed)\n```\n\n\nProcessing GIS data\n-------------------\n\nThere are several GIS data types:\n\n- `surfaces_density`: for zonal data expressed in densities\n- `dots_value`: represents dots on the map with an absolute value\n- `lines_and_dots`: to use for layers that are not densities or values\n\n### Check content of GIS data\n\nIt is possible to easily check the content of a shapefile by importing it directly into QGIS. In QGIS, you could check the projection in which the layer is expressed by having a look at its properties.\n\nAlso take a look at the attribute table to have a better idea of how the data are expressed.\n\nHere is a list of some items to check before processing shapefiles:\n- Which type of shapefile (zonal, dots…)?\n- Which columns are useful? Which are not?\n- How are values expressed (absolute, density)?\n- Do values seem coherent? (maximum, minimum, spread)\n- Are there missing values?\n- Which properties are already included in the file? Which have to be set?\n\n### Operations on GIS data\n\nIn this section, you will find all the recurring operations you might need in case you have to correct your GIS data.\n\n#### Reproject data\n\nItSim only manages layers expressed in the [WGS84 projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84) ([EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)), which is the standard projection for GPS systems. However, many of the layers we have at our disposal might be expressed in the projection used by the agency that created the data. As an example, the [Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_conformal_conic_projection) 93 projection ([EPSG:2154](https://epsg.io/2154)) is the projection used for most of the layers in metropolitan France. This is due to the fact that this projection gives accurate areas for this latitude.\n\nTo reproject data, you can use the `reproject_layer_in_WGS84()` function which will reproject the data in WGS84 like in our example:\n\n```python\ngis_data_path = \"path/to/gis_files/pop.shp\"\ndata = read_file(gis_data_path)\nnew_data = gisp.reproject_layer_in_WGS84(data)\n```\n\nNote that you should not use the WGS84 projection to calculate areas. **It is advised to project in WGS84 at the end of your process.**\n\n\n#### Calculate area\n\nIn case you need to process a zonal layer but the areas of the zones are missing, it is possible to generate them by using the `calculate_area()` function.\n\n```python\ngis_data_path = \"path/to/gis_files/pop.shp\"\ndata = read_file(gis_data_path)\nnew_data = gisp.calculate_area(data)\n```\n\nThe `data` DataFrame will contain an `area` column with area expressed **in km²**. Note that if the `area_unit_in_km2` option is `False`, `area` will be expressed in m².\n\nItSim expects density expressed in **/km²**, so be careful if you use areas expressed in **m²**.\n\nThe result *DataFrame* will be projected in [Gall-Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection) projection, this corresponds to [SR-ORG:22](https://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/22/) projection.\n\n#### Calculate densities\n\nData in zonal shapefiles could be expressed in absolute values but ItSim only manages data expressed in densities. In this case, it will be necessary to convert data into densities values by using the `calculate_density()` function.\n\n```python\ngis_data_path = \"path/to/gis_files/pop.shp\"\ndata = read_file(gis_data_path)\nnew_data = gisp.calculate_density(\n    data=data,\n    field_from='pop',\n    field_to='pop_dens',\n    area_field='area',\n)\n```\n\nThe `new_data` DataFrame will contain a `pop_dens` column expressed in `[unit]/km²`. The `area` column is used for the input area and **should be expressed in km²** unless `area_field_unit_in_km2` option is `False`, then it is expected to be in m².\n\nIf no `area_field` is indicated, the area is calculated in this function and the `area_field_unit_in_km2` parameter is ignored.\n\nThe result *DataFrame* will be projected in [Gall-Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection) projection, this corresponds to [SR-ORG:22](https://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/22/) projection.\n\n#### Bounding box and coordinates\n\nYou can easily generate a bounding box thanks to the `create_bbox()` function by only giving the coordinates of the zone to define.\n\n*Example:*\n\n```python\nmin_lat = 48.814099\nmax_lat = 48.902192\nmin_lon = 2.250824\nmax_lon = 2.425232\nbbox = gisp.create_bbox(min_lat=min_lat, max_lat=max_lat, min_lon=min_lon, max_lon=max_lon)\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can retrieve coordinates from a bounding box with the `get_coordinates_from_bbox()` function.\n\n*Example:*\n\n```python\nbbox = {\n    'north_lat': 48.902192,\n    'south_lat': 48.814099,\n    'west_lon': 2.250824,\n    'east_lon': 2.425232,\n}\n(min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon) = gisp.get_coordinates_from_bbox(bbox=bbox)\n```\n\n#### Merge layers\n\nIn case we have several data sources at our disposal, we can merge several shapefiles into one by using the `merge_and_clean_layers()` function. However, be careful, this function can only be used with layers of the same structure (same type, same columns).\n\n```python\ngis_data_path = \"path/to/gis_files\"\nraw_data_paths = [\n    gis_data_path + \"/pop_76.shp\",\n    gis_data_path + \"/pop_27.shp\"\n]\ncolumns_to_keep = ['pop_dens', 'superficie']\npopulation_data = gisp.merge_and_clean_layers(raw_data_paths, *columns_to_keep)\n```\n\nNote that even if we only keep columns that are indicated in the `columns_to_keep` list, the function will also keep the `geometry` column.\n\n#### Generate a layer from carroyage\n\nIf you are looking for population data on metropolitan France and you do not have any other sources, you can use the INSEE's \"carroyage\": a georeferenced grid with population density data. To generate a population shapefile from the carroyage, you can use the `create_carroyage()` function.\n\n```python\n# Define paths for carroyage\ncarroyage_root = (\n    ITSIM_DATA_PATH\n    / \"PLT/ZZ_DCME/3_GESTION/7_LE LAB DIGITAL/800_PROJETS/PROJET_20160622_ITSIM\"\n    / \"1_TRAVAIL/2_DEVELOPPEMENT/1.1_Données SYSTRA/France\"\n)\ncarroyage_path = carroyage_root / \"carroyage_insee_200m_2010\" / \"200m-carreaux-metropole\" / \"car_m.mif\"\npopulation_path = carroyage_root / \"carroyage_insee_200m_2010\" / \"200m-carreaux-metropole\" / \"car_m.dbf\"\n# Define output path\npopulation_output_path = Path(\"/path/to/mycity/population.shp\")\nbbox = {\n    'north_lat': 48.902192,\n    'south_lat': 48.814099,\n    'west_lon': 2.250824,\n    'east_lon': 2.425232,\n}\npop_data = gisp.create_carroyage(\n    carroyage_path=carroyage_path,\n    data_path=population_path,\n    output_path=population_output_path,\n    bbox=bbox,\n)\n```\n\nIt is also possible to give coordinates as parameters instead of bbox:\n\n```python\n# Define paths for carroyage\ncarroyage_root = (\n    ITSIM_DATA_PATH\n    / \"PLT/ZZ_DCME/3_GESTION/7_LE LAB DIGITAL/800_PROJETS/PROJET_20160622_ITSIM\"\n    / \"1_TRAVAIL/2_DEVELOPPEMENT/1.1_Données SYSTRA/France\"\n)\ncarroyage_path = carroyage_root / \"carroyage_insee_200m_2010\" / \"200m-carreaux-metropole\" / \"car_m.mif\"\npopulation_path = carroyage_root / \"carroyage_insee_200m_2010\" / \"200m-carreaux-metropole\" / \"car_m.dbf\"\n# Define output path\npopulation_output_path = Path(\"/path/to/mycity/population.shp\")\nmin_lat = 48.814099\nmax_lat = 48.902192\nmin_lon = 2.250824\nmax_lon = 2.425232\npop_data = gisp.create_carroyage(\n    carroyage_path=carroyage_path,\n    data_path=population_path,\n    output_path=population_output_path,\n    min_lat=min_lat,\n    max_lat=max_lat,\n    min_lon=min_lon,\n    max_lon=max_lon\n)\n```\n\n#### Customize GIS layers aspect\n\nIt is possible to customize parameters to changes the look of `line_and_dots` GIS layers in ItSim. There are functions for each type of layer (dots, lines, shapes). When setting properties, you can choose to use already existing values that are in one of the layer's columns or a single value that will be used for every entry.\n\n##### Dots\nDots layers are mostly used to represent interest points, stations, buildings… You can use use the `set_dot_properties()` function to customize the following parameters:\n- Title (text that will be displayed into a popup)\n- Color\n- Radius\n- Opacity\n\nIn the following example, I already have the information for names, so I will give the name of the column to use as a data source. Meanwhile, I do not have any information about the colors, so I would like to set a color for every entry. in this case, all I need to do is to create a callable (a lambda function below) that will be applied to every entry. I also would like to set a specific value for the radius and for the opacity, so I will just provide the value to apply to every entry:\n\n```python\ndata = read_file('path/to/my/file')\ndot_title_field = 'NAME'\ndot_color_function = lambda l: '#A15C33'\n\ndata_with_props = gisp.set_dots_properties(\n    data=data,\n    title=dot_title_field,\n    color=dot_color_function,\n    radius=5,\n    opacity=0.8,\n):\n```\n\n##### Lines\nLine layers are mostly used to represent an uneditable transport network. For example, it could be used to represent a railway network that interacts with the bus network we are editing. It could also be used\n\nYou can use the `set_lines_properties()` function to customize the following parameters:\n- Title\n- Color\n- Route type (the route type will influence the lines' width as they are displayed on the map; use it only if it represents a transport network)\n- Width\n- Opacity\n\nIn the following example, I would like to compute the title based on two existing columns in my dataframe. To do so, I will give a lambda that will return a string from the two other existing columns. In the meantime, I would like to set a color for the lines to display but I do not have any information about the colors in my dataframe. This is why I will set a color based on random color for the `route_color` parameter.\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\n\ndata = read_file('path/to/my/file')\nline_title_field = lambda l: l['name'] + ' - ' + l['neighbourhood']\ncolors = ['#169f5c', '#345b64', '#543c10', '#8eea21', '#116f95', '#cf26a9', '#a1d188', '#c0c577', '#daef5d', '#50c04e', '#16ce77']\nnb_colors = len(colors)\nline_color_function = lambda l: colors[randint(1, nb_colors) -1]\n\ndata_with_props = gisp.set_lines_properties(\n    data=data,\n    title=line_title_field,\n    color=line_color_function,\n    opacity=0.8,\n    route_type=3,\n)\n```\n\nNote that if the `width` parameter is provided, it will override the `route_type`'s computed width.\n\n# Shapes\nShapes layers are used to represents zones on the map. They could be used to represent buildings, project areas, facilities…\n\nYou can use the `set_shapes_properties()` function to customize the following parameters:\n- Title\n- Fill color\n- Stroke color\n- Opacity\n\nIn the following example, we will retrieve the name from the already existing data, set colors for fill and stroke of the shape with callables (lambda functions) and a single value for opacity.\n\n```python\ndata = read_file('path/to/my/file')\nshape_title_field = 'NAME'\nshape_fill_color_function = lambda x: '#2A7AE0'\nshape_fill_color_function = lambda x: '#1959A0'\n\ndata_with_props = gisp.set_shapes_properties(\n    data=data,\n    title=shape_title_field,\n    fill_color=shape_fill_color_function,\n    stroke_color=shape_stroke_color_function,\n    opacity=0.5,\n)\n```\n\n# Property fields\n\nIn case you need to get the names of the properties' fields in order to clean a layer's columns, you can use the following functions to get them:\n- `get_dot_properties_names()`\n- `get_line_properties_names()`\n- `get_shape_properties_names()`\n\n\nWrite a project creation script\n-------------------------------\n\nTo create a project, ItSim's back-end will need:\n- A **project description JSON** file **(mandatory)**\n- A **valid GTFS** file (optional)\n- One or several **shapefile(s)** (optional)\n\nIn order to generate all the required files in a single command, we will write a shell script at \"itsim-project-data\" repository's root.\n\nIn this example, we will create a project \"MyCity\" based on a GTFS and on a single zonal population shapefile. The first thing is to write a `create_mycity.sh` script calling data processing scripts in case files are missing:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nPROJECTS_DATA_PATH=\"$(dirname $(readlink -f \"$0\"))\"\n\n# Creating GTFS archive if needed\nif [ ! -f \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity-gtfs.zip\" ]; then\n    echo \"Generate missing GTFS file...\"\n    pipenv run python $PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/gtfs_generator.py\nfi\n\n# Creating shapefiles if needed\nNEW_SHP_GENERATED=false\nif [ ! -f \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020.shp\" ]; then\n    echo \"Generate missing shapefiles...\"\n    python $PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/data_processing.py\n    NEW_SHP_GENERATED=true\nfi\n```\n\nThen, zonal layers should be simplified if needed. This step reduces shapefile size and geometry complexity:\n\n```shell\n# Simplifying shapefiles if needed (updated shapefiles or missing simplified versions)\nif [ ! -f \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020.shp\" ] || $NEW_SHP_GENERATED; then\n    echo \"Simplifying shapes...\"\n    simplify_shapefile \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020.shp\" pop_dens 30 0.9 \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020_simplified.shp\"\nfi\n```\n\nAfterwards, we will determine the legend of density layers. This is an operation to carry out by hand on simplified layers. It is important to check the accuracy of results given by the `./scripts/shp2geojson` script and round up them if needed:\n\n```shell\n# Generating legends from simplified layers\n\n### Color legends scales\n# Population colors: FEE5D9-A50F15 (red)\n\n# shp2geojson -i $PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020_simplified.shp -f pop_dens -c FEE5D9 -C A50F15\n# => [Enter the results given by the script]\n# rounded => [Enter the legend to use]\n```\n\nFinally, we will define our project's parameters by generating a project JSON file. This JSON file will contain a full description of the project to create with all parameters, layers to use, scenarios to create, scenario parameters…\n\nInstead of creating this file by hand, we will use the `create_json_project` script with options as follows:\n\n```shell\necho Creating json project\ncreate_json_project \\\n    -o \"systra\" \\\n    -n \"MyCity\" \\\n    -g \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity-gtfs.zip\" \\\n    -w DATA \\\n    --ref-name \"Base System\" \\\n    -s \"Scénario 1\" all False \\\n    -l surfaces_density \\\n        systrasaas.mycity_pop_2018 \\\n        mycity_pop_2018 \\\n        pop pop pop pop pop \\\n        \"$PROJECTS_DATA_PATH/mycity/mycity_population_2020_simplified.shp\" \\\n        permis_den \\\n        permisDens \\\n        5,EFF3FF,20,B5CAE6,100,7BA2CD,500,4179B4,1700,08519C \\\n    --param-buffer \\\n        2 1000 \\\n        3 500 \\\n        300 \\\n    --param-typical-days \\\n        \"JOB\" 20200121 \\\n        \"SAT\" 20200125 \\\n        \"SUN\" 20200119 \\\n    --param-time-types \\\n        \"Morning rush hour\" 070000 095959 \\\n        \"Midday\" 100000 155959 \\\n        \"Evening rush hour\" 160000 192959 \\\n    --param-center \"6.342383\" \"46.075223\" \\\n    --param-distance \"m\" \\\n    --param-currency-symbol \"€\"\n```\n\nYou can find additional information on how to use this script by using the `-h` option.\n\nAll output files needed by ItSim's backend will be output in the `DATA` directory.\n\n\nImport a project into ItSim\n---------------------------\n\nCongratulations! Now, that you have a valid GTFS, shapefiles and a project description JSON, you need to copy them in the `sws_itsim` backend directory:\n```shell_session\n[itsim-project-data] $ cp -r DATA/* ../sws_itsim/\n```\n\nYou are finally ready to import a project into ItSim!\n\nGo to your `sws_itsim` directory and activate your Python virtual environment by executing the command `pipenv shell`. Then, check that all the required files exist.\n\nWe can now use the script `./bootstrap_db/launcher` to import the project. We will cover the essential options you will need below. In case you need more information on all the options and how to use the import script, it is strongly advised to use the `-h` option. *Example:* `./bootstrap_db/launcher -h`\n\nFirst of all, we will have to know on which platform we will deploy the project and have the rights to do it. Indicate the backend's URL in the `-u` option and the access token with the `-t` option. To use your token easily, you can store its value into an environment variable:\n`export $ITSIM_TOKEN=[your token]`. Note that your token must be a super-admin's token because only a super-admin has the right to create a project.\n\nIn our case, we have a layer to display on the map, so we would like to use *Mapbox*. To be able to connect to the service we also need a token. When you have the mapbox access token, you can store it into an environment variable as we did for ItSim's token: `export $MAPBOX_TOKEN=[your mapbox token]`\n\nFinally, we will have to indicate the project and the GTFS file's path with the `-P` option as well as the organization with the `-o` option.\n\nFor our example, we will import the project on our local backend (on `5001` port):\n\n```shell_session\n[sws_itsim] $ ./bootstrap_db/launcher -t \"$ITSIM_TOKEN\" -T \"$MAPBOX_TOKEN\" -u http://localhost:5001 -o systra -P mycity gtfs/mycity-gtfs.zip\n```\n\nNote that you can check that your project description JSON is valid by adding the `-n` option at the end of the command. It will not do anything else and it is advised before trying to import a project for the first time.\n\nWhen it is all right, you can remove the `-n` option and execute the command. Then, confirm the operation by entering `y` or `yes` when asked.\n\n\n",
