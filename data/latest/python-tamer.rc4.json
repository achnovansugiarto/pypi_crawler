    "description": "============================\nIntroduction to python-TAMER\n============================\n\n| Official documentation hosted at https://tch521.github.io/python-TAMER \n\nPython-TAMER is a python package for performing advanced environmental exposure calculations in a simple and\naccessable way suitable for users with minimal python experience. To get started, check the `Installation`_\ntab.\n\n.. _Installation: https://tch521.github.io/python-TAMER/installation.html\n\n* Free software: BSD-3-Clause licence\n\nThe Toolkit for Analysis and Maps of Exposure Risk (TAMER) is a python package designed to calculate estimates \nof individual and population exposure across a geographic area. Currently, the project is focused on erythemal \nUV radiation exposure, but the tools provided by TAMER could be used in a variety of contexts provided there \nis appropriate source data. In addition to providing a simple methods for basic exposure calculations, (such \nas mean, median, and maximum intensities over certain time periods,) TAMER allows users to calculate daily \ndoses by integrating the exposure over time. TAMER deals with very large volumes of data, but is designed with \nmemory efficiency in mind so that such data can be processed on even modest personal comptuters.\n\nIn the context of UV, the dose received by an exposed individual is far more relevant to their corresponding \nhealth risk than the ambient level of UV. Usually, these doses are measured by wearable devices. Harris et al.\n2021 (https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020268) explains the various benefits of instead estimating such doses\nbased on satellite-derived data with sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution. The Swiss UV \nclimatology provided by Vuilleumier et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106177) is Currently\nthe most appropriate source data for TAMER as it provides erythemal UV at an approximately 1.5km spatial\nresolution and an hourly temporal resolution. Harris et al. 2021 shows that with location, date, and time\ninformation, reasonable ambient doses can be calculated. However, to calculate personal doses, the Exposure\nRatio (ER) must also be known, that being the ratio between the ambient dose and the personal dose received\nby a certain body part. Different body parts have varying ERs which also depend on body posture, for example\nthe ER of the forehead is lower when bowing down than when standing normally. TAMER includes a model from\nVernez et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1038/jes.2014.6) to calculate ERs according to anatomic zone, posture,\nand time of year. python-tamer.SpecificDoses is a table-like class designed to take location, date, time, \nposture, and anatomic zone information to calculate specific ambient and personal doses of the described\nindividuals. \n\nA large part of TAMER is dedicated to producing high quality maps of a variety of exposure metrics. Maps of UV\nexposure often show the mean, median, or max irradiance for a given time period. TAMER includes the option to \ncalculate such maps, but also offers more advanced alternatives. The TAMER approach balances versatility with\nmemory efficiency by calculating histograms for each pixel as a first step. These histograms can describe the\nirradiance or the daily doses for any time selection and exposure schedule. They can be built up iteratively, \nprocessing one year at a time to ensure only moderate memory usage. With the pixel histograms calculated, the\nuser then has to choose a statistical descriptor to condense the distribution into a single number to be \nplotted on the map. This can be basic statistics such as mean, median, or max, however we include some more\nadvanced options such as a custom percentile and the standard deviation. In a forthcoming release, we shall\nalso include the option to define one's own formula for a custom descriptor, allowing for metrics like the\ndifference between the 95th percentile and the median divided by the standard deviation which would be \nindicative of the severity of acute exposure instances. The simple and novel approaches to exposure estimation\nprovided by the combined release of high resolution UV data (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106177) and\nthe simple and novel exposure calculations provided by TAMER give opportunity to epidemiologists and public \nhealth experts to study UV exposure with higher detail than has ever been possible before.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Calculate daily doses rapidly with custom exposure schedules\n* Analyse exposure distributions per pixel\n* Produce maps to represent chronic and acute exposure using standard or custom metrics\n* Replicate dosimetry measurements using Exposure Ratio modelling\n\nIn Development\n--------------\n\n* Improved support for custom statistical descriptors\n* Custom area selection for the SpecificDoses class\n\nFuture work\n-----------\n\n* Improved support for different source files (new units, temporal resolutions, etc.)\n* Integrate support for cross multiplication of ExposureMap with population distribution data\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.4.0 Open Alpha (2021-05-24)\n--------------------------------\n\n* Added the new ``ExposureMapSequence`` class providing much improved map making capabilities (this was the majority of the work)\n* Added the ``render_map()`` function to produce more beautiful maps across in a more versatile way\n* Added the ``str2daysofyear()`` function to interpret keywords like month names and produce the days of the year\n* Added the ``analyse_variable()`` function to the ``SpecificDoses`` class for more flexible analysis options\n\n\n0.3.1 Open Alpha (2021-03-29)\n---------------------------------\n\n* Fixed errors in example code in documentation\n* Fixed ``ER_Vernez_2015()`` function \n* Updated assumptions about units to reflect new dataset from Vuilleumier in UVI rather than W m-2\n* Fixed issue where modifying ``map_options`` property would result in it being set to None\n\n\n0.3.0 Open Alpha (2021-03-23)\n---------------------------------\n\n* Compiled and added to PyPI for easy public access\n* Added standalone function for calculating ER using the Vernez 2015 method: ``ER_Vernez_2015()``\n* Significantly expanded and standardised docstrings, adding examples\n* Fixed error involving day selection in ``SpecificDoses`` class being one day late\n* Added ``SpecificDoses.standard_column_names()`` function for standardising column names to ensure functionality \n\n0.2.0 Alpha (2021-03-11)\n-----------------------------------\n\n* Added documentation\n* Added basic unit tests for each class (``SpecificDoses`` and ``ExposureMap``)\n* Added histogram descriptor calculator functions to subroutines.\n* Added map making functionality for ``ExposureMap`` class, limited consideration of ``map_options`` at this stage\n* Fixed errors when working with single day test data (but anticipate further issues with this, to be fixed in a later release)\n\n\n0.1.0 Pre-Alpha (2021-03-02)\n--------------------------------------\n\n* Alpha release on github only, no documentation and limited functionality",
