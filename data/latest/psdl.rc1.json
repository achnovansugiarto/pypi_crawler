    "description": "PSDL - A pythonic wrapper for SDL\n=================================\n\npsdl is a package that wraps the excellent SDL2 module in an easy to use python \ninterface.\n\nNote that this project is still in its super early stages, theres lots of stuff \nstill left to be wrapped. \n\n\nWhy PSDL?\n---------\nYou may be already knowing that there are many SDL wrappers out there, from stuff \nlike PySDL2 to pygame. What makes PSDL different? Well, PSDL aims to be a wrapper \n\"of right thickness\". There are some SDL wrappers that are too thin, and they \nexpose the C-level details to python, which is not that elegant. Also, they \ndirectly copy the SDL API, which is un-pythonic.\nAnd there are SDL wrappers that are too thick, and they dont export the SDL\nAPI at all, they have their own API.\n\nPSDL aims to export the SDL API as directly as possible, while also \"pythonifying\"\nit. Let us consider a typical SDL function that looks like \n``SDL_SomeFunctionForSomething``. PSDL will export it, by stripping the inital\n``SDL_`` (because python has namespaces, unlike C) and changing the style of the\nfunction name to something that looks more pythonic. The function will look like\n``psdl.some_function_for_something`` from the PSDL side. Similarly, SDL constants\nare exported by just stripping the initial ``SDL_`` part of it, ``SDL_SOME_CONSTANT``\nbecomes ``psdl.SOME_CONSTANT``. While SDL provided enums, PSDL does not export the\nenums directly, it just exports the constants within it.\n\nComing to structures, PSDL does different stuff based on the context. Since C is not\nobject oriented, you will find this style of coding commonly used in SDL.\n\n::\n\n    SDL_someobj *obj;\n    SDL_CreateSomeObj(obj, someargs);\n    SDL_SomeMethod(obj, moreargs);\n    SDL_AnotherMethod(obj, args, moreargs);\n    SDL_DestroyObj(obj);\n\nWe can take advantage of python OOP, and psdl will export the samething like\n\n::\n    obj = psdl.SomeObj(args)\n    obj.some_method(moreargs)\n    obj.another_method(args, moreargs)\n\nNotice the naming convention adopted here. Also notice that in python, we need\nnot explicitly deallocate objects, python being a high-level language, does that\nautomatically for us.\n\nInstallation\n------------\npsdl can be installed via pip, using the following command, ``pip3 install psdl``.\nNote that currently, psdl does not provide binary \"wheels\" on PyPI, so the pip \ncommand will build psdl from source. For that, check out the section below\n\nBuilding from source\n--------------------\nWindows\n~~~~~~~\nThe build process is pretty straight forward on windows. You just need to have\nthe MSVC C compiler set up correctly. psdl is automatically going to get all its\ndependencies (ie, its gonna download SDL from the official website) and automatically\nbuild psdl.\n\nMac/Linux\n~~~~~~~~~\nOn Mac/linux too, the build process aint complicated. All you need to have is a C\ncompiler (which is usually present on most systems) and SDL installed via your \npackage manager. Then psdl will easily install from source.\n\nAdvanced Build Options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou can set two environment variables, ``PSDL_INCLUDE_DIR`` and ``PSDL_LIB_DIR`` to\noptionally specify paths to SDL include and library directories, respectively. This\nwill be used by PSDL when it attempts to build from source.\n\nTODO\n----\nTheres still lot left to do, like I said earlier, this project is still in its super\nearly stages. There needs to be docs, tests, and examples written, apart from the \ncode that needs to be written.",
