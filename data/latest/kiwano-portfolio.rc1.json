    "description": "\r\n# Kiwano Portfolio\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide an interface with Binance now, and more exchanges to come,\r\nto be able to backtest, livetest and livetrade your trading algorithms on crypto-currencies.\r\nWe thought we could let you focus all your creativity and effort on your trading strategies, \r\nand let us handle the rest, since this part is simpler but necessary.\r\n\r\nThe code is composed of two classes, a `portfolio` manager \r\nthat tracks the progress over time and provides useful statistics \r\non the performance of the trading algorithm. And the \r\ninheriting class `strategy` that plays the trading algo.\r\n\r\n## Functionalities\r\n\r\nTo understand how to use this repository, have a look at the ```main.py``` file.\r\nThe typical way to use the code is the following:\r\n1. Create `portfolio`;\r\n2. Add a `strategy`;\r\n3. Run in one of the three *modes* (see below);\r\n4. Obtain log and plots displaying the performance of your trading strategy.\r\n\r\nThe three *modes* are:\r\n- **Backtesting** (or FastBacktesting if the strategy loops already in time): will \r\nrun your algorithm on historical data, and will provide the performance\r\nthat your algorithm would have had if it was trading in the past.\r\n- **Livetesting**: will run your algorithm on real-time data, and will provide the performance that your algorithm would have had if it was trading live, but\r\nwithout actually trading with real money.\r\n- **Livetrading**: will run your algorithm on real-time data, and will provide the performance \r\nthat your algorithm is having while trading live, with real money.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of `strategy` is:\r\n1. Compute the *metrics* on data\r\n2. Compute the first layer *strategy* to create `order`\r\n3. Compute the second layer *strategy* to make the `order` effective in the `portfolio`\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nInstall the content of the requirements.txt file with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. \r\nYou will then need to create an API key and secret on Binance to be able to use the code.\r\nGo to API Management in Settings on Binance, and click on Create API. Select System generated API key,\r\nname the API, and once you pass the authentication, you have to \r\nedit restriction and tick Enable Spot and Margin Trading if you want to livetrade with your algorithm.\r\nThis is not necessary if you only want to backtest or livetest. You can then copy the API key and secret\r\nin a ```config.py```  file and define the variables as strings with the following names:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napi_key = 'your key as a string'\r\napi_secret = 'your secret as a string'\r\n```\r\nFor an example check the `config_template.py` in the `API/binance/` folder.\r\nYou can finally save the file in the ```API/binance``` folder or pass the filepath\r\nas the `api_keys_location` argument when creating the portfolio. Then you are ready to go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n- ~~[CLEAN] Code + simplify `strategy` class [DONE]~~\r\n- ~~[CODE] Add multiple crypto input [DONE]~~\r\n- [CODE] multiple crypto in output\r\n\r\n## Social media\r\nWant to participate in the Kiwano adventure, join our Discord !\r\n\r\n \r\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/698CKv8t\">\r\n<img src=\"https://it.moobion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/discord-logo.png\" alt=\"https://discord.gg/698CKv8t\" style=\"width:48px;height:48px;\">\r\n</a>\r\n",
