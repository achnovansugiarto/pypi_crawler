    "description": "ctypesGsl is a Python binding for the GSL library using the ctypes\npackage.  It is probably somewhat slower than pygsl but has other\nadvantages:\n\n1. It is very easy to install, the only dependency (except for GSL\n   itself) is the ctypes package, standard since Python 2.5.  No\n   compilation or is required during installation.  The implementation\n   is simpler too as it does not require SWIG wrappers, C code or\n   shared libraries.\n\n2. ctypes seems to be the preferred future way to do Python bindings,\n   since it is independent from python implementation used, e.g. it\n   should work with PyPy.\n\nCurrently it is slowly becoming reasonably complete.  Implemented are:\n\nerror handling\nbasic function\ncomplex numbers\npolynomials\nspecial functions\nvectors\nmatrices\npermutations (incomplete)\ncombinations\nBLAS\nlinear algebra\neigensystems\nnumerical integration\nrandom number generators\nquasi random number generators\nprobability distributions\nMonte Carlo integration\nordinary differential equations\nnumerical integration\nChebyshev approximations\none dimensional root finding\none dimensional minimization\nmultidimensional root finding\nmultidimensional minimization\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nGPL v.3, see LICENSE.txt\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThere is a (somewhat experimental) setup.py script in the top-level\ndirectory.\n\nAlternatively, just copy the ctypesGsl directory to\n\n/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/\n\nor wherever you keep your local python packages.  You're ready to go:\n\n>>> import ctypesGsl\n>>> ctypesGsl.expm1(1)\n1.7182818284590451\n\nthe test_cgsl.py file contains some examples based on GSL tests.\n\n\nDesign\n======\n\nThe idea is that the package should be usable like a standard python\nlibrary.  The low level functions are thus often wrapped in python\nfunctions which try to hide some of the complexity.  \n\nThe higher level interface does error handling (exceptions are raised\nif return value is not GSL_SUCCESS), and tries to make common usage\neasy, e.g. gsl_complex numbers can be used just as standard Python\ncomplex numbers, tries to allocate integration workspace of reasonable\nsize if none is provided, etc.\n\nSee the test_cgsl.py file for examples.\n\n\nError handling\n==============\n\nThere are two ways to check for errors in GSL: internal error handler,\nand return values.  ctypesGsl handles both.  The return values are\nautomatically checked and (by default) an exception is raised if the\nreturn value indicates an error.\n\nUnfortunately ctypes does not propagate exceptions raised inside\ncallback functions to the main thread, so if an exception is raised in\nthe internal error handler, a backtrace is printed but the program\ncontinues.  Internal GSL error handler is thus (by default) redefined\nto only print a warning message.\n\nBoth internal and return value error handlers can be redefined.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nNone at the moment.  See test_cgsl.py file for usage examples.\n",
