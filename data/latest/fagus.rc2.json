    "description": "# Fagus\nThese days most data is converted to and from `json` and `yaml` while it is sent back and forth to and from API's. Often this data is deeply nested. `Fagus` is a Python-library that makes it easier to work with nested dicts and lists. It allows you to traverse and edit these tree-objects with simple function-calls that handle the most common errors and exceptions internally. The name fagus is actually the latin name for the genus of beech-trees.\n\n### Code and tests ready, documentation still WORK IN PROGRESS\nThis documentation is still Work in Progress. I have some more ideas for features, but most of the coding is done. The code is tested as good as possible, but of course there still might be bugs as this library has just been released. Just report them so we get them away ;). Even though this README is not done yet, you should be able to use most of the functions based on the docstrings and some trial and error. Just ask questions [here](https://github.com/treeorg/Fagus/discussions/categories/q-a) if sth is unclear. The documentation will be filled in and completed as soon as possible.\n\n**HAVE FUN!**\n\n## Basic principles\n\n### Introduction -- What it solves\nImagine you want to fetch values from a nested dict like shown below:\n\n```python\n>>> a = {\"a1\": {\"b1\": {\"c1\": 2}, \"b2\": 4}, \"a2\": {\"d1\": 6}}\n>>> a[\"a1\"][\"b1\"][\"c1\"]  # prints 2, so far so good\n2\n>>> a[\"a1\"][\"b3\"][\"c2\"]  # fails, because b3 doesn't exist\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n ...\nKeyError: 'b3'\n```\nThe problem is that the consecutive square brackets fail if one of the nodes doesn't exist. There are ways around, like writing `a.get(\"a1\", {}).get(\"b3\", {}).get(\"c2\")` or surrounding each of these statements with `try-except`, but both are hard to maintain and verbose. Below you can see how `Fagus` can help to resolve this:\n```python\n>>> from fagus import Fagus\n>>> print(Fagus.get(a, (\"a1\", \"b3\", \"c2\")))  # None, as this key doesn't exist in a\nNone\n```\nAs you can see, now only one function call is needed to fetch the value from `a`. If one of the keys doesn't exist, a default value is returned. In this case no default value was specified, so `None` is returned.\n\nThe whole `Fagus` library is built around these principles. It provides:\n* **Simple functions**: replacing tedious code that is hard to maintain and error prone\n* **Few exceptions**: Rather than raising a lot of exceptions, `Fagus` does what is most likely the programmer's intention.\n\n### The path-parameter\n`Fagus` is built around the concept of a Mapping or dict, where there are keys that are used to refer to values. For lists, the indices are used as keys. In opposition to a simple dict, in `Fagus` the key can consist of multiple values -- one for each layer.\n```python\n>>> a = [5, {6: [\"b\", 4, {\"c\": \"v1\"}]}, [\"e\", {\"fg\": \"v2\"}]]\n>>> Fagus.get(a, (1, 6, 2, \"c\"))\n'v1'\n>>> Fagus.get(a, \"2 1 fg\")\n'v2'\n```\n* **Line 3**: The path-parameter is the tuple in the second argument of the get-function. The first and third element in that tuple are list-indices, whereas the second and fourth element are dict-keys.\n\n* **Line 5**: In many cases, the dict-keys that are traversed are strings. For convenience, it's also possible to provide the whole path-parameter as one string that is split up into the different keys. In the example above, `\" \"` is used to split the path-string, this can be customized using `value_split`.\n\n### Static and instance usage\nAll functions in `Fagus` can be used statically, or on a `Fagus`-instance, so the following two calls of `get()` give the same result:\n```python\n>>> a = [5, {6: [\"b\", 4, {\"c\": \"v1\"}]}, [\"e\", {\"fg\": \"v2\"}]]\n>>> Fagus.get(a, \"2 0\")\n'e'\n>>> b = Fagus(a)\n>>> b.get(\"2 0\")\n'e'\n```\nThe first call of `get()` in line 3 is static, as we have seen before. No `Fagus` instance is required, the object `a` is just passed as the first parameter. In line 5, `b` is created as a `Fagus`-instance -- calling `get()` on `b` also yields `e`.\n\nWhile it's not necessary to instantiate `Fagus`, there are some neat shortcuts that are only available to `Fagus`-instances:\n```python\n>>> a = Fagus()\n>>> a[\"x y z\"] = 6  # a = {\"x\": {\"y\": {\"z\": 6}}}\n>>> a.x  # returns the whole subnode at a[\"x\"]\n{'y': {'z': 6}}\n>>> del a[(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\")]  # Delete the z-subnode in a[\"x y\"]\n>>> a()\n{'x': {'y': {}}}\n```\n* **Square bracket notation**: On `Fagus`-instances, the square-bracket notation can be used for easier access of data if no further customization is needed. Line 3 is equivalent to `a.set(6, \"x y z\")`. It can be used for getting, setting and deleting items (line 6).\n* **Dot notation**: The dot-notation is activated for setting, getting and deleting items as well (line 4). It can be used to access `str`-keys in `dict`s and `list`-indices, the index must then be preceded with an underscore due to Python naming limitations (`a._4`). This can be further customized using [`value_split`](#value_split)\n\n`Fagus` is a wrapper-class around a tree of `dict`- or `list`-objects. To get back the root-object inside the instance, use `()` to call the object -- this is shown in line 7.\n\n### Fagus options\nThere are several parameters used across many functions in `Fagus` which steer the behaviour of that function. Often, similar behaviour is intended across a whole application or parts of it, and this is where options come in handy allowing to only specify these parameters once.\n\nOne example of a `Fagus`-option is [`default`](#default). This option contains the value that is returned e.g. in `get()` if a `path` doesn't exist, see [Introduction](#introduction----what-it-solves), code block two for an example.\n\n**The four levels of `Fagus`-options**:\n1. **Argument**: The highest level - if an option is specified directly as an argument to a function, that value takes precedence over all other levels.\n2. **Instance**: If an option is set for an instance, it will apply to all function calls at that instance where level one has not been specified.\n3. **Class**: If an option is set at class level (i.e. `Fagus.option`), it applies to all function calls and all instances where level one and two of that option aren't defined. Options at this level apply for the whole file `Fagus` has been imported in.\n4. **Default**: If no other level is specified, the hardcoded default for that option is used.\n\nBelow is an example of how the different levels take precedence over one another:\n```python\n>>> a = Fagus({\"a\": 1})\n>>> print(a.get(\"b\"))  # b does not exist in a - default is None by default\nNone\n>>> Fagus.default = \"class\"  # Overriding default at class level\n>>> a.get(\"b\")  # now 'class' is returned, as None was overridden\n'class'\n>>> a.default = 'instance'  # setting the default option at instance level\n>>> a.get(\"b\")  # for a default is set to 'instance' -- return 'instance'\n'instance'\n>>> b = Fagus({\"a\": 1})\n>>> b.get(\"b\")  # for b, line 7 doesn't apply -- line 5 still applies\n'class'\n>>> del Fagus.default  # deleting an option resets it to its default\n>>> print(b.get(\"b\"))  # for default, the default is None\nNone\n>>> a.get(\"b\", default='arg')  # passing an option as a parameter always wins\n'arg'\n```\nAll `Fagus`-options at level two can be set in the constructor of `Fagus`, so they don't have to be set one by one like in line 8. You can also use `options()` on an instance or on the `Fagus`-class to set several options in one line, or get all the options that apply to an instance.\n\nSome `Fagus`-functions return child-`Fagus`-objects in their result. These child-objects inherit the options at level two from their parent.\n\nThe remaining part of this section explains the options one by one.\n\n#### default\n* **Default**: `None`\n* **Type**: `Any`\n\nThis value is returned if the requested [`path`](#the-path-parameter) does not exist. Example in [Introduction](#introduction----what-it-solves), code block two.\n\n#### default_node_type\n* **Default**: `\"d\"`\n* **Type**: `str`\n* **Allowed values**: `\"d\"` and `\"l\"`\n\nCan be either `\"d\"` for `dict` or `\"l\"` for `list`. A new node of this type is created if it's not specified clearly what other type that node shall have. It is used e.g. when Fagus is instanciated with an empty constructor:\n```python\n>>> Fagus.default_node_type = \"l\"\n>>> a = Fagus()\n>>> a()  # the root node of a is an empty list as this was set in line 2\n[]\n>>> del Fagus.default_node_type\n>>> b = Fagus()\n>>> b()  # the root node of b is a dict (default for default_node_type)\n{}\n```\n\n#### if_\n* **Default**: `_None`, meaning that the value is not checked\n* **Type**: Any\n\nThis option can be used to verify values before they're inserted into the `Fagus`-object. Generating configuration-files, default values can often be omitted whereas special settings shall be included, `if_` can be used to do this without an extra if-statement.\n```python\n>>> a = Fagus(if_=True)  # the only allowed value for set is now True\n>>> a.v1 = True\n>>> a()  # v1 was set, because it was True (as requested in line 1)\n{'v1': True}\n>>> a.v2 = None\n>>> a()  # note that v2 has not been set as it was not True\n{'v1': True}\n>>> a.set(6, \"v2\", if_=(4, 5, 6))  # 6 was set as it was in (4, 5, 6)\n{'v1': True, 'v2': 6}\n>>> a.set(\"\", \"v3\", if_=bool)  # v3 is not set because bool(\"\") is False\n{'v1': True, 'v2': 6}\n```\nPossible ways to specify `if_`:\n* **Single value**: This is shown in line 1 -- the only values that can now be set is `True`, anything else is not accepted.\n* **List of values**: You can also specify any `Iterable` (e.g. a `list`) with multiple values -- the values that can be set must be one of the values in the `list` (line 8).\n* **Callable**: You can also pass a callable object or a function (lambda) -- the result of that call determines whether the value is set (line 10).\n\n#### iter_fill\n* **Default**: `_None`, meaning that `iter_fill` is inactive\n* **Type**: Any\n\nThis option is used to get a constant number of items in the iterator while iterating over a `Fagus`-object, see [here](#iterating-over-nested-objects) for more about iteration in `Fagus`. The example below shows what happens by default when iterating over a `Fagus`-object where the leaf-nodes are at different depths:\n```python\n>>> a = list(Fagus.iter({\"a\": {\"b\": 2}, \"c\": 4}, 1))\n>>> a\n[('a', 'b', 2), ('c', 4)]\n>>> for x, y, z in a:\n...     print(x, y, z)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)\n>>> a = list(Fagus.iter({\"a\": {\"b\": 2}, \"c\": 4}, 1, iter_fill=None))\n>>> a\n[('a', 'b', 2), ('c', 4, None)]\n>>> for x, y, z in a:\n...     print(x, y, z)\na b 2\nc 4 None\n```\nIn line 3, we see that the first tuple has three items, and the second only two. When this is run in a loop that always expects three values to unpack, it fails (line 4-8). That problem is solved in line 9 by using `iter_fill`, which fills up the shorter tuples with the value that was specified for `iter_fill`, here `None`. With that in place, the loop in line 12-15 runs through without raising an error. Note that `max_depth` has to be specified for `Fagus` to know how many items to fill up to.\n\n#### iter_nodes\n* **Default**: `False`\n* **Type**: `bool`\n\nThis option is used to get references to the traversed nodes while iterating on a `Fagus`-object, see [here](#iterating-over-nested-objects) for more about iteration in `Fagus`. Below is an example of what this means:\n```python\n>>> list(Fagus.iter({\"a\": {\"b\": 2}, \"c\": 4}, 1))\n[('a', 'b', 2), ('c', 4)]\n>>> list(Fagus.iter({\"a\": {\"b\": 2}, \"c\": 4}, iter_nodes=True))\n[({'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 4}, 'a', {'b': 2}, 'b', 2), ({'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 4}, 'c', 4)]\n```\nAs you can see, the node itself is included as the first element in both tuples. In the first tuple, we also find the subnode `{\"b\": 2}` as the third element. In line 2, the tuples are filled after this scheme: `key1, key2, key3, ..., value`. In line 4, we additionally get the nodes, so it is `root-node, key1, node, key2, node2, key3, ..., value`.\n\nSometimes in loops it can be helpful to actually have access to the whole node containing other relevant information. This can be especially useful combined with [`skip()`](#skipping-nodes-in-iteration).\n\n#### value_split\n\n### Iterating over nested objects\n\n#### Skipping nodes in iteration.\n",
