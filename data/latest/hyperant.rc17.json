    "description": "## Author: Victor Arsenescu\n## Date: 10/18/21\n## Project Title: Boston Medical Center (BMC)\n## Research Programmer Technical Test â€“ \"Ant on a Cube\"\n\n# After installing with pip, run `hyperant-ui` or `hyperant-gui` to start.\n# If pip fails, use this [Github Repo](https://github.com/v0rtex20k/hyperant)\n\n\n----------------------------->>> Introduction <<--------------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to thank BMC for giving me this problem. I've\ndone a lot of coding interviews, and most of them just slap down some algorithm\nimplementation question that you're supposed to summon from rote memory or throw\na bunch of boring HackerRank questions at you that force you to stay in very\ntight margins of complexity, time, memory allocation, function arguments, etc.\n\nI think above all, I admire freedom and creativity, and even if I don't get the\njob, I really respect the fact that BMC let me have free reign on this and\nchoose how I wanted to implement it. Guiding without commanding is a nuanced\nskill, and I think you've done a great job of it. Thank you for taking the time\nto read all this and run everything :).\n\nAnyway, enough waffling. Here's how you start the code:\n\n\n**To run this code, all you need to do is install it with pip, then run\n`$ hyperant-gui` or `$ hyperant-gui` in terminal from *anywhere* on your local\nmachine (symlinked to the same UI version in /bin, so they're both global).\nThat's it! After that, the GUI should open and you can enter your preferences.**\n\nAs a quick note, the vertex indices start at *ZERO*, so for example we would run\nthe original problem (ant traveling to opposite corner on a regular 3D cube ) by\nentering 3, 0, 7 for the dimensions, entry index, and exit index. The number of\nthreads is up to you - I usually pick 50, but you can try out different settings.\nThen just hit \"Compute\", or hit \"End\" if you want to try new settings.\n\n\nFor dimensions > 6, it takes a while to actually draw the hypercube, so for a\nwhile you might just see a bunch of dots (all black except for one blue and one\nred) appearing on the screen - this is expected.\n\n------------------------------>>> Overview <<-----------------------------------\n\nI debated which language to use for a while, and ultimately decided that C++ had\nthe most robust and generalizeable parallelization and linear algebra tools, so\nI went with C++ for the backend (I'll describe what that actually entails in a\nsecond). I actually had a frontend piece in Java for a bit, but it was very slow\nand often quite ugly, even after I tried to parallelize it. Also, I found out\nthat turtles (or each language's equivalent) do a ton of extra stuff under the\nhood, making operations involving them very poorly parallelizable. I really did\nnot like the available libraries in Java and C/C++, even though they were\npurportedly meant to mirror Python's turtle library. I therefore decided to use\nPython for the front end and make a simple GUI that will display the result and\nrender the surface (more on that in a sec).\n\nIn a sentence:\n\tI built a tool which generates a k-dimensional hypercube (where k is set by\n\tthe user through the UI, or as a cmdline argument) and computes the mean\n\ttime it would take to travel between any two vertices, where the specific\n\tvertices are again chosen by the user.\n\nThis is a twist on what was originally asked for (ant on 3-dimensional cube). I\nam not 100% sure why I chose this, but here we are. It seemed more fun and\nchallenging. To clarify, my code works for k-dimensional hypercubes up to like\nk == 20 ish. The exact number depends on your computer and how much space in\nmemory terminal is allowed to reserve during runtime. After k = 8 though it\ntakes a really long time to actually plot the hypercubes, no matter what\nlanguage I tried. I think this is just part-and-parcel with the complexity of\nhypercubes themselves. I will now describe the back and front end components so\nyou can get a better idea of what I did.\n\n------------------------------->>> Backend <<-----------------------------------\n\nThis part was coded entirely in C++. It is extremely parallelized and supports\nmultithreading. I tried to use as few external libaries as possible (besides\nlibomp of course, otherwise it wouldn't support multithreading) but one library\nwhich my code does rely on for the very last step is Armadillo, which is\nbasically C++'s version of numpy for Python (sorry, numpy is still the GOAT). As\nsoon as I saw this problem, I thought \"I can model this as a random walk on an\nundirected k-regular graph\", and then from there it was obvious that I could\nrepresent the walk as an Absorbing Markov Chain where the destination vertex\nwas constructed to be the only absorbing node each time. I then implemented all\nthis as follows:\n\n\t* First, I had to solve the labeling problem. Given an abitrary dimension\n\t  number k, how do you label each node of your k-dimensional hypercube such\n\t  that each label is unique and all the edges make sense? I was originally\n\t  planning on doing something with the Hamming distance between the\n\t  bit-strings of each node in the range [0,2^k) but I figured out this\n\t  super quick and dirty way to get all the neighbors of a node. For node n,\n\t  all one needs to compute is [n^(1<<s)], s in [0,k). This is important,\n\t  because now I didn't have to make a whole separate function with a doubly\n\t  nested for loop. Instead, I could compute this atomically and parallelize\n\t  the original nested for loop directly! (which is what I did)\n\n\t* I then allocated and seeded my arrays with some small random values, as\n\t  is done with most modern linalg libraries. This left me with a matrix Q\n\t  (among others) that represented the submatrix of my original transition\n\t  matrix wihtout the rows and columns with the same index as the destination\n\t  node. A bit of randomness is important because if we happen to produce\n\t  extremely ill-conditioned matrices for a particular choice of settings,\n\t  there is at least some hope that within a few iterations, the matrix will\n\t  be a bit less ugly and a solver can at least approximate the value.\n\n\t* Next, I needed to get the inverse of Q so I could solve for the steady\n\t  state vector of my Markov Chain. Obviously, it's very inefficient to just\n\t  invert Q directly, so I decided to take the more efficient route and compute\n\t  the LU decomposition of A first. I did this **by hand**, using the famous\n\t  Dolittle Algorithm. This allowed me to parallelize a few inner loops more\n\t  directly. I checked the validity of these neighbors by seeing if LU indeed\n\t  equaled Q (pretty close in most cases).\n\n\t* The last part of my code needed to invert L and Q (which I sanitized\n\t  and fored to be perfectly triangular) relies on Armadillo's solve function\n\t  which, supposedly, is implemented as a thin wrapper over the core DGETRF,\n\t  SGETR, and LAPACK libraries, which honestly probably makes it way faster\n\t  than even a well parallelized solution.\n\n\t* With all this, I had enough to compute the steady state vector, from which\n\t I then took the average of the i^th entry and the entries of its k-nearest\n\t neighbors to try and avoiding any rounding errors or outliers that may have\n\t appeared. I also checked my result for the steady state vector against the\n\t \"true\" one generated by a naive Python helper script I wrote (not included)\n\nThe script `scripts/run-hypercube.sh` acts as a makefile for my backend code. Do\nnote that you will need clang installed to compile the code. Furthermore, to\nrun it on a Linux machine (or at least Linux OS in a VM or container), you will\nneed brew in order to install armadillo and openmp (installs are already\nembedded in the build script).\n\nI should also note I did a thorough analysis of my code with valgrind and there\nare no memory leaks or bugs.\n\n------------------------------>>> Frontend <<-----------------------------------\n\nAs I mentioned, I used Python for the frontend simple UI because it was fast and\neffective. I didn't realize the sorry state that C++ and Java are in when it\ncomes to simple graphics rendering! Arcane functions and very counter-intuitive.\nBasically, I made a simple UI that framed the problem as a Multi-dimensional\nBus or Train or some form of metropolitan ant transport that could take you from\npoint A to point B in the k-dimensional hypercube and returned the expected time\nto do so. I then passed args to my C++ through Python internals and collected\nthe output so I could display it. My UI now takes the user's preferences and\nactually draws the k-dimensional hypercube (after k=8 it gets very slow).\nI should also note that I took care not to import any non-standard modules\n(everything I imported is part of Python's out-of-the-box Lib).\n\nAs before, file \"scripts/run-hypercube.sh\" acts as a makefile for my backend C++\ncode, which is freshly compiled each time I run it. To run the python file, do\n`$ hyperant-ui` or `$ hyperant-gui` and wait for the GUI to pop up. Note that\nsometimes it takes a minute or two for the code to start drawing as you travel\nto higher dimensions. To start the animation, just fill in the fields in the \nUI popup (ndim >=1, nthreads >=1, etc) and hit \"Compute\". If you want to change\ncertain parameter settings, hit \"End\" and repeat these steps to launch again.\nTechnically if you spam \"Compute\" with new parameters it will actually work,\nbut it's a bit wonky, so the recommended behavior is just to terminate the\nscript with the \"End\" button (avoid Control-C) and start again.\n\n\n----------------------------->>> Conlusion <<-----------------------------------\n\nThat's it! Thanks for reading and for considering me for the position - I really\nhope I get the privilige of working with you all :)\n\n\nTwine upload instructions:\n\n// Increment the version number in setup.py\n\n// (inside hyperant)\n`$ python3.7 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`\n`$ twine check dist/*` // check PASSED\n\n// (inside \\~/.pypirc )\n// [pypi]\n// username = __token__\n// password = API_KEY from [here][https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/]\n\n`$ twine upload --repository pypi --skip-existing dist/*  --verbose`\n\n\n\n",
