Secondarily, it can be used \nfor **recognizing arbitrary structures** that can be described by \nPython's typing system.\n\nPlease see [Philosophy] for more information about how trycast\ndiffers from similar libraries like pydantic.\n\n[Philosophy]: https://github.com/davidfstr/trycast/wiki/Philosophy\n\n### Why use TypedDict?\n\nWhy use typed dictionaries to represent data structures instead of classes,\nnamed tuples, or other formats?\n\nTyped dictionaries are the natural form that JSON data comes in over the wire.\nThey can be trivially serialized and deserialized without any additional logic.\nFor applications that use a lot of JSON data - such as web applications - \nusing typed dictionaries is very convenient for representing data structures.\n\nIf you just need a lightweight class structure that doesn't need excellent\nsupport for JSON-serialization you might consider other alternatives for\nrepresenting data structures in Python such as [dataclasses] (**recommended**),\n[named tuples], [attrs], or plain classes.\n\n[dataclasses]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/#abstract\n[named tuples]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple\n[attrs]: https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\npython -m pip install trycast\n```\n\n\n## Recommendations while using trycast\n\n- So that `trycast()` can recognize TypedDicts with mixed required and\n  not-required keys correctly:\n    * Use Python 3.9+ if possible.\n    * Prefer using `typing.TypedDict`, unless you must use Python 3.8.\n      In Python 3.8 prefer `typing_extensions.TypedDict` instead.\n    * Avoid using `mypy_extensions.TypedDict` in general.\n\n\n## Presentations & Videos\n\nA presentation about **using trycast to parse JSON** was given at the\n2021 PyCon US Typing Summit:\n\n[![2021 PyCon US Typing Summit Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidfstr/trycast/main/README/TypingSummit2021_Presentation_FirstSlide.png)](https://youtu.be/ld9rwCvGdhc?t=1782)\n\nA presentation describing **tools that use Python type annotations at runtime**,\nincluding trycast, was given at the 2022 PyCon US Typing Summit:\n\n[![2022 PyCon US Typing Summit Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidfstr/trycast/main/README/TypingSummit2022_Presentation_FirstSlide.png)](https://youtu.be/CmXQOoiMy-g)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome!

Normally these kinds of types are\n      rejected by trycast with a TypeNotSupportedError because these\n      types do not preserve enough information at runtime to reliably\n      determine which keys are required and which are potentially-missing.\n    * If strict=False then trycast will treat `NewType(\"Foo\", T)`\n      the same as `T`. Normally NewTypes are rejected by trycast with a\n      TypeNotSupportedError because values of NewTypes at runtime\n      are indistinguishable from their wrapped supertype.\n* **eval** --\n  If eval=False then trycast will not attempt to resolve string\n  type references, which requires the use of the eval() function.\n  Otherwise string type references will be accepted.\n\nRaises:\n\n* **TypeNotSupportedError** --\n    * If strict=True and either mypy_extensions.TypedDict or a\n      Python 3.8 typing.TypedDict is found within the `tp` argument.\n    * If strict=True and a NewType is found within the `tp` argument.\n    * If a TypeVar is found within the `tp` argument.\n    * If an unrecognized Generic type is found within the `tp` argument.\n* **UnresolvedForwardRefError** --\n  If `tp` is a type form which contains a ForwardRef.\n* **UnresolvableTypeError** --\n  If `tp` is a string that could not be resolved to a type.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n* † TypeForm[T] is a [type annotation object]. For example: `list[str]`\n\n* ‡ TypeFormString[T] is a stringified [type annotation object].
