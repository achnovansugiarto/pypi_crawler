See the \"Installing\" section for more details.\n\nTo quickly try it out, run ``python -m speech_recognition`` after installing.\n\nProject links:\n\n-  `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/>`__\n-  `Source code <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition>`__\n-  `Issue tracker <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/issues>`__\n\nLibrary Reference\n-----------------\n\nThe `library reference <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/library-reference.rst>`__ documents every publicly accessible object in the library. This document is also included under ``reference/library-reference.rst``.\n\nSee `Notes on using PocketSphinx <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst>`__ for information about installing languages, compiling PocketSphinx, and building language packs from online resources. This document is also included under ``reference/pocketsphinx.rst``.\n\nYou have to install Vosk models for using Vosk. `Here <https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models>`__ are models avaiable. You have to place them in models folder of your project, like \"your-project-folder/models/your-vosk-model\"\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nSee the ``examples/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/examples>`__ in the repository root for usage examples:\n\n-  `Recognize speech input from the microphone <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/microphone_recognition.py>`__\n-  `Transcribe an audio file <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/audio_transcribe.py>`__\n-  `Save audio data to an audio file <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/write_audio.py>`__\n-  `Show extended recognition results <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/extended_results.py>`__\n-  `Calibrate the recognizer energy threshold for ambient noise levels <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/calibrate_energy_threshold.py>`__ (see ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` for details)\n-  `Listening to a microphone in the background <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/background_listening.py>`__\n-  `Various other useful recognizer features <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/special_recognizer_features.py>`__\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nFirst, make sure you have all the requirements listed in the \"Requirements\" section. \n\nThe easiest way to install this is using ``pip install SpeechRecognition``.\n\nOtherwise, download the source distribution from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/>`__, and extract the archive.\n\nIn the folder, run ``python setup.py install``.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nTo use all of the functionality of the library, you should have:\n\n* **Python** 2.6, 2.7, or 3.3+ (required)\n* **PyAudio** 0.2.11+ (required only if you need to use microphone input, ``Microphone``)\n* **PocketSphinx** (required only if you need to use the Sphinx recognizer, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``)\n* **Google API Client Library for Python** (required only if you need to use the Google Cloud Speech API, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google_cloud``)\n* **FLAC encoder** (required only if the system is not x86-based Windows/Linux/OS X)\n* **Vosk** (required only if you need to use Vosk API speech recognition ``recognizer_instance.recognize_vosk``)\n\nThe following requirements are optional, but can improve or extend functionality in some situations:\n\n* On Python 2, and only on Python 2, some functions (like ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``) will run slower if you do not have **Monotonic for Python 2** installed.\n* If using CMU Sphinx, you may want to `install additional language packs <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst#installing-other-languages>`__ to support languages like International French or Mandarin Chinese.\n\nThe following sections go over the details of each requirement.\n\nPython\n~~~~~~\n\nThe first software requirement is `Python 2.6, 2.7, or Python 3.3+ <https://www.python.org/download/releases/>`__. This is required to use the library.\n\nPyAudio (for microphone users)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`PyAudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads>`__ is required if and only if you want to use microphone input (``Microphone``). PyAudio version 0.2.11+ is required, as earlier versions have known memory management bugs when recording from microphones in certain situations.\n\nIf not installed, everything in the library will still work, except attempting to instantiate a ``Microphone`` object will raise an ``AttributeError``.\n\nThe installation instructions on the PyAudio website are quite good - for convenience, they are summarized below:\n\n* On Windows, install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: execute ``pip install pyaudio`` in a terminal.\n* On Debian-derived Linux distributions (like Ubuntu and Mint), install PyAudio using `APT <https://wiki.debian.org/Apt>`__: execute ``sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio`` in a terminal.\n    * If the version in the repositories is too old, install the latest release using Pip: execute ``sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev python3-all-dev && sudo pip install pyaudio`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3).\n* On OS X, install PortAudio using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__: ``brew install portaudio``. Then, install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: ``pip install pyaudio``.\n* On other POSIX-based systems, install the ``portaudio19-dev`` and ``python-all-dev`` (or ``python3-all-dev`` if using Python 3) packages (or their closest equivalents) using a package manager of your choice, and then install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: ``pip install pyaudio`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3).\n\nPyAudio `wheel packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`__ for common 64-bit Python versions on Windows and Linux are included for convenience, under the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__ in the repository root. To install, simply run ``pip install wheel`` followed by ``pip install ./third-party/WHEEL_FILENAME`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3) in the repository `root directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition>`__.\n\nPocketSphinx-Python (for Sphinx users)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`PocketSphinx-Python <https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python>`__ is **required if and only if you want to use the Sphinx recognizer** (``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``).\n\nPocketSphinx-Python `wheel packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`__ for 64-bit Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 on Windows are included for convenience, under the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__. To install, simply run ``pip install wheel`` followed by ``pip install ./third-party/WHEEL_FILENAME`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3) in the SpeechRecognition folder.\n\nOn Linux and other POSIX systems (such as OS X), follow the instructions under \"Building PocketSphinx-Python from source\" in `Notes on using PocketSphinx <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst>`__ for installation instructions.\n\nNote that the versions available in most package repositories are outdated and will not work with the bundled language data. Using the bundled wheel packages or building from source is recommended.\n\nSee `Notes on using PocketSphinx <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst>`__ for information about installing languages, compiling PocketSphinx, and building language packs from online resources. This document is also included under ``reference/pocketsphinx.rst``.\n\nVosk (for Vosk users)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nVosk API is **required if and only if you want to use Vosk recognizer** (``recognizer_instance.recognize_vosk``).\n\nYou can install it with ``python3 -m pip install vosk``.\n\nYou also have to install Vosk Models:\n\n`Here <https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models>`__ are models avaiable for download. You have to place them in models folder of your project, like \"your-project-folder/models/your-vosk-model\"\n\nGoogle Cloud Speech Library for Python (for Google Cloud Speech API users)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`Google Cloud Speech library for Python <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart>`__ is required if and only if you want to use the Google Cloud Speech API (``recognizer_instance.recognize_google_cloud``).\n\nIf not installed, everything in the library will still work, except calling ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google_cloud`` will raise an ``RequestError``.\n\nAccording to the `official installation instructions <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart>`__, the recommended way to install this is using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: execute ``pip install google-cloud-speech`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3).\n\nFLAC (for some systems)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA `FLAC encoder <https://xiph.org/flac/>`__ is required to encode the audio data to send to the API. If using Windows (x86 or x86-64), OS X (Intel Macs only, OS X 10.6 or higher), or Linux (x86 or x86-64), this is **already bundled with this library - you do not need to install anything**.\n\nOtherwise, ensure that you have the ``flac`` command line tool, which is often available through the system package manager. For example, this would usually be ``sudo apt-get install flac`` on Debian-derivatives, or ``brew install flac`` on OS X with Homebrew.\n\nMonotonic for Python 2 (for faster operations in some functions on Python 2)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOn Python 2, and only on Python 2, if you do not install the `Monotonic for Python 2 <https://github.com/atdt/monotonic>`__ library, some functions will run slower than they otherwise could (though everything will still work correctly).\n\nOn Python 3, that library's functionality is built into the Python standard library, which makes it unnecessary.\n\nThis is because monotonic time is necessary to handle cache expiry properly in the face of system time changes and other time-related issues. If monotonic time functionality is not available, then things like access token requests will not be cached.\n\nTo install, use `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: execute ``pip install monotonic`` in a terminal.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nThe recognizer tries to recognize speech even when I'm not speaking, or after I'm done speaking.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTry increasing the ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` property. This is basically how sensitive the recognizer is to when recognition should start. Higher values mean that it will be less sensitive, which is useful if you are in a loud room.\n\nThis value depends entirely on your microphone or audio data. There is no one-size-fits-all value, but good values typically range from 50 to 4000.\n\nAlso, check on your microphone volume settings. If it is too sensitive, the microphone may be picking up a lot of ambient noise. If it is too insensitive, the microphone may be rejecting speech as just noise.\n\nThe recognizer can't recognize speech right after it starts listening for the first time.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` property is probably set to a value that is too high to start off with, and then being adjusted lower automatically by dynamic energy threshold adjustment. Before it is at a good level, the energy threshold is so high that speech is just considered ambient noise.\n\nThe solution is to decrease this threshold, or call ``recognizer_instance.adjust_for_ambient_noise`` beforehand, which will set the threshold to a good value automatically.\n\nThe recognizer doesn't understand my particular language/dialect.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTry setting the recognition language to your language/dialect. To do this, see the documentation for ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_wit``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_api``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_houndify``, and ``recognizer_instance.recognize_ibm``.\n\nFor example, if your language/dialect is British English, it is better to use ``\"en-GB\"`` as the language rather than ``\"en-US\"``.\n\nThe recognizer hangs on ``recognizer_instance.listen``; specifically, when it's calling ``Microphone.MicrophoneStream.read``.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis usually happens when you're using a Raspberry Pi board, which doesn't have audio input capabilities by itself. This causes the default microphone used by PyAudio to simply block when we try to read it. If you happen to be using a Raspberry Pi, you'll need a USB sound card (or USB microphone).\n\nOnce you do this, change all instances of ``Microphone()`` to ``Microphone(device_index=MICROPHONE_INDEX)``, where ``MICROPHONE_INDEX`` is the hardware-specific index of the microphone.\n\nTo figure out what the value of ``MICROPHONE_INDEX`` should be, run the following code:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import speech_recognition as sr\n    for index, name in enumerate(sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names()):\n        print(\"Microphone with name \\\"{1}\\\" found for `Microphone(device_index={0})`\".format(index, name))\n\nThis will print out something like the following:\n\n::\n\n    Microphone with name \"HDA Intel HDMI: 0 (hw:0,3)\" found for `Microphone(device_index=0)`\n    Microphone with name \"HDA Intel HDMI: 1 (hw:0,7)\" found for `Microphone(device_index=1)`\n    Microphone with name \"HDA Intel HDMI: 2 (hw:0,8)\" found for `Microphone(device_index=2)`\n    Microphone with name \"Blue Snowball: USB Audio (hw:1,0)\" found for `Microphone(device_index=3)`\n    Microphone with name \"hdmi\" found for `Microphone(device_index=4)`\n    Microphone with name \"pulse\" found for `Microphone(device_index=5)`\n    Microphone with name \"default\" found for `Microphone(device_index=6)`\n\nNow, to use the Snowball microphone, you would change ``Microphone()`` to ``Microphone(device_index=3)``.\n\nCalling ``Microphone()`` gives the error ``IOError: No Default Input Device Available``.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs the error says, the program doesn't know which microphone to use.\n\nTo proceed, either use ``Microphone(device_index=MICROPHONE_INDEX, ...)`` instead of ``Microphone(...)``, or set a default microphone in your OS. You can obtain possible values of ``MICROPHONE_INDEX`` using the code in the troubleshooting entry right above this one.\n\nThe code examples raise ``UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character`` when run.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen you're using Python 2, and your language uses non-ASCII characters, and the terminal or file-like object you're printing to only supports ASCII, an error is raised when trying to write non-ASCII characters.\n\nThis is because in Python 2, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_wit``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_api``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_houndify``, and ``recognizer_instance.recognize_ibm`` return unicode strings (``u\"something\"``) rather than byte strings (``\"something\"``). In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings.\n\nTo make printing of unicode strings work in Python 2 as well, replace all print statements in your code of the following form:\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        print SOME_UNICODE_STRING\n\nWith the following:\n\n    .. code:: python\n\n        print SOME_UNICODE_STRING.encode(\"utf8\")\n\nThis change, however, will prevent the code from working in Python 3.\n\nThe program doesn't run when compiled with `PyInstaller <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki>`__.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs of PyInstaller version 3.0, SpeechRecognition is supported out of the box. If you're getting weird issues when compiling your program using PyInstaller, simply update PyInstaller.\n\nYou can easily do this by running ``pip install --upgrade pyinstaller``.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian, I get annoying output in the terminal saying things like \"bt_audio_service_open: [...] Connection refused\" and various others.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe \"bt_audio_service_open\" error means that you have a Bluetooth audio device, but as a physical device is not currently connected, we can't actually use it - if you're not using a Bluetooth microphone, then this can be safely ignored. If you are, and audio isn't working, then double check to make sure your microphone is actually connected. There does not seem to be a simple way to disable these messages.\n\nFor errors of the form \"ALSA lib [...] Unknown PCM\", see `this StackOverflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7088672/pyaudio-working-but-spits-out-error-messages-each-time>`__. Basically, to get rid of an error of the form \"Unknown PCM cards.pcm.rear\", simply comment out ``pcm.rear cards.pcm.rear`` in ``/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf``, ``~/.asoundrc``, and ``/etc/asound.conf``.\n\nFor \"jack server is not running or cannot be started\" or \"connect(2) call to /dev/shm/jack-1000/default/jack_0 failed (err=No such file or directory)\" or \"attempt to connect to server failed\", these are caused by ALSA trying to connect to JACK, and can be safely ignored. I'm not aware of any simple way to turn those messages off at this time, besides `entirely disabling printing while starting the microphone <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/issues/182#issuecomment-266256337>`__.\n\nOn OS X, I get a ``ChildProcessError`` saying that it couldn't find the system FLAC converter, even though it's installed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInstalling `FLAC for OS X <https://xiph.org/flac/download.html>`__ directly from the source code will not work, since it doesn't correctly add the executables to the search path.\n\nInstalling FLAC using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ ensures that the search path is correctly updated. First, ensure you have Homebrew, then run ``brew install flac`` to install the necessary files.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\nTo hack on this library, first make sure you have all the requirements listed in the \"Requirements\" section.\n\n-  Most of the library code lives in ``speech_recognition/__init__.py``.\n-  Examples live under the ``examples/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/examples>`__, and the demo script lives in ``speech_recognition/__main__.py``.\n-  The FLAC encoder binaries are in the ``speech_recognition/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/speech_recognition>`__.\n-  Documentation can be found in the ``reference/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/reference>`__.\n-  Third-party libraries, utilities, and reference material are in the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__.\n\nTo install/reinstall the library locally, run ``python setup.py install`` in the project `root directory <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition>`__.\n\nBefore a release, the version number is bumped in ``README.rst`` and ``speech_recognition/__init__.py``. Version tags are then created using ``git config gpg.program gpg2 && git config user.signingkey DB45F6C431DE7C2DCD99FF7904882258A4063489 && git tag -s VERSION_GOES_HERE -m \"Version VERSION_GOES_HERE\"``.\n\nReleases are done by running ``make-release.sh VERSION_GOES_HERE`` to build the Python source packages, sign them, and upload them to PyPI.\n\nTesting\n~~~~~~~\n\nTo run all the tests:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python -m unittest discover --verbose\n\nTesting is also done automatically by TravisCI, upon every push. To set up the environment for offline/local Travis-like testing on a Debian-like system:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo docker run --volume \"$(pwd):/speech_recognition\" --interactive --tty quay.io/travisci/travis-python:latest /bin/bash\n    su - travis && cd /speech_recognition\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install swig libpulse-dev\n    pip install --user pocketsphinx monotonic && pip install --user flake8 rstcheck && pip install --user -e .\n    python -m unittest discover --verbose # run unit tests\n    python -m flake8 --ignore=E501,E701 speech_recognition tests examples setup.py # ignore errors for long lines and multi-statement lines\n    python -m rstcheck README.rst reference/*.rst # ensure RST is well-formed\n\nFLAC Executables\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe included ``flac-win32`` executable is the `official FLAC 1.3.2 32-bit Windows binary <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/flac/flac-1.3.2-win.zip>`__.\n\nThe included ``flac-linux-x86`` and ``flac-linux-x86_64`` executables are built from the `FLAC 1.3.2 source code <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/flac/flac-1.3.2.tar.xz>`__ with `Manylinux <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux>`__ to ensure that it's compatible with a wide variety of distributions.\n\nThe built FLAC executables should be bit-for-bit reproducible. To rebuild them, run the following inside the project directory on a Debian-like system:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # download and extract the FLAC source code\n    cd third-party\n    sudo apt-get install --yes docker.io\n\n    # build FLAC inside the Manylinux i686 Docker image\n    tar xf flac-1.3.2.tar.xz\n    sudo docker run --tty --interactive --rm --volume \"$(pwd):/root\" quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_i686:latest bash\n        cd /root/flac-1.3.2\n        ./configure LDFLAGS=-static # compiler flags to make a static build\n        make\n    exit\n    cp flac-1.3.2/src/flac/flac ../speech_recognition/flac-linux-x86 && sudo rm -rf flac-1.3.2/\n\n    # build FLAC inside the Manylinux x86_64 Docker image\n    tar xf flac-1.3.2.tar.xz\n    sudo docker run --tty --interactive --rm --volume \"$(pwd):/root\" quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64:latest bash\n        cd /root/flac-1.3.2\n        ./configure LDFLAGS=-static # compiler flags to make a static build\n        make\n    exit\n    cp flac-1.3.2/src/flac/flac ../speech_recognition/flac-linux-x86_64 && sudo rm -r flac-1.3.2/\n\nThe included ``flac-mac`` executable is extracted from `xACT 2.39 <http://xact.scottcbrown.org/>`__, which is a frontend for FLAC 1.3.2 that conveniently includes binaries for all of its encoders. Specifically, it is a copy of ``xACT 2.39/xACT.app/Contents/Resources/flac`` in ``xACT2.39.zip``.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n::\n\n    Uberi <me@anthonyz.ca> (Anthony Zhang)\n    bobsayshilol\n    arvindch <achembarpu@gmail.com> (Arvind Chembarpu)\n    kevinismith <kevin_i_smith@yahoo.com> (Kevin Smith)\n    haas85\n    DelightRun <changxu.mail@gmail.com>\n    maverickagm\n    kamushadenes <kamushadenes@hyadesinc.com> (Kamus Hadenes)\n    sbraden <braden.sarah@gmail.com> (Sarah Braden)\n    tb0hdan (Bohdan Turkynewych)\n    Thynix <steve@asksteved.com> (Steve Dougherty)\n    beeedy <broderick.carlin@gmail.com> (Broderick Carlin)\n\nPlease report bugs and suggestions at the `issue tracker <https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/issues>`__!\n\nHow to cite this library (APA style):\n\n    Zhang, A.
