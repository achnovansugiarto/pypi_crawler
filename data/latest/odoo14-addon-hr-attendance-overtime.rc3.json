If no\n  theoretical work time found for open hr attendance a fallback to the\n  auto-close module rules are applied.\n\n\nThis module is used by `hr_attendance_validation` in order to helps\nmanager review weeks hours and generate compensatoires hours per\nemployee.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThis modules depend on different configurations:\n\nTo setup ranges hours on employee work time weeks:\n\n#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Resource > Working Times*\n   or from employee form Go to *Employees > Employees > in employee form view > working hours*.\n#. On the form view you can setup 4 new fields add by this module on each attendance lines\n\n  * *check-in from*: Check-in before will result an extra overtime line with an earlier check-in reason (`CI-E`)\n  * *check-in to*: Check-in after will add a late check-in reason (`CI-L`)\n  * *check-out from*: Check-out before will add a earlier check-out reason (`CO-E`)\n  * *check-out to*: Check-out after will generate an extra overtime line with a late check-out reason (`CO-L`)\n\nWe have chosen to not reuse existing *Work from* and *Work to* that are used by other modules like *hr_holidays*\nwith compensatoires leaves. To be able to define a bigger range that overlap that time.\n\nYou can personalize 4 kinds of reason label that are selected by code which must remains the same and uniq:\n\n#. Go to *Attendances > configuration > Reason*\n#. personalize name for following code:\n\n  * `CI-E`: check-in earlier (checked-in occurred before *check-in from*)\n  * `CI-L`: check-in late (checked-in occurred after *check-in to*)\n  * `CO-E`: check-out earlier (checked-out occurred before *check-out from*)\n  * `CO-L`: check-out late (checked-out occurred after *check-out to*)\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Display planning in kiosk mode as well\n* Ensure it works with a two weeks calendar\n* Considering global time off and hr_holidays\n* Ensure there is no overlap between work time\n  lines of the same work time calendar\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues/new?body=module:%20hr_attendance_overtime%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Pierre Verkest\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Pierre Verkest <pierreverkest84@gmail.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-petrus-v| image:: https://github.com/petrus-v.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/petrus-v\n    :alt: petrus-v\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-petrus-v| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/hr-attendance <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/tree/14.0/hr_attendance_overtime>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
