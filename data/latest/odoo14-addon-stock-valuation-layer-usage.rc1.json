That is,\nmakes it possible to identify in what stock moves was a given valuation layer\nused, and how much quantity was taken by the particular stock move.\n\nThis kind of traceability is important in case that at some point you want\nto conduct an revaluation (for example, in case that the purchase order price\nchanges after the products have been received into stock).\n\nAlso, it changes the way the outgoing layers are created in order to respect\nthe MTO case. When creating the out svl, Odoo takes the first layer available\nwith value. The module stock_valuation_layer_usage arises an issue with that\nOdoo process. Odoo will take always the oldest svl. However, that is not the\ncase for MTO. When there is a fixed link between the incoming move and the\noutgoing move, at the time of creating the outgoing svl the system should\ntake the specific incoming svl not just the oldest one. Also, when the case\nis not MTO, the system should avoid using svl that are \"reserved\".\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThis module depends on the OCA module 'stock_account_product_run_fifo_hook',\navailable in the same OCA repository https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n* Create a product with that uses a category with automatic\n  inventory valuation and FIFO costing method.\n\n* Create a purchase order for this product and receive it into stock.\n\n* Deliver the product to a customer and check the completed stock move in\n  'Inventory / Reporting / Stock Moves'. You will see a section\n  'Valuation Layers' where you will be able to identify the valuation layers\n  that were used to value this move, and the quantity and value that was taken.\n\n* Create several MTO order\n\n* Deliver the products to a customer in a random way and check the section\n  'Valuation Layers Usage'. The MTO logic is respected, then FIFO applies.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n13.0.1.0.0 (2020-01-03)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [13.0][MIG] stock_valuation_layer_usage\n  Create module\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_valuation_layer_usage%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* ForgeFlow\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* ForgeFlow S.L. <contact@forgeflow.com>\n  * Jordi Ballester <jordi.ballester@forgeflow.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/14.0/stock_valuation_layer_usage>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
