This could\nbe useful for example to know the device to use to process it. An other use case\ncould be to know how many trucks you need to deliver your products.\n\nBy default, the delivery module from Odoo will compute the picking weight.\nUnfortunately, it will not compute the volume. This module will add the volume\ncomputation to the picking and to the stock move. This information will be\nstored in the database and will be available on the picking form view and\non the stock move form view.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn order to have a pertinent value for the computed volume, the dimension fields\nmust be set on all the products.\n\nThe computed volume depends on the move state.\n\n* If the move is done, the volume is the volume for the qty done.\n* If the move is cancelled or draft waiting, the volume is the volume for the\n  qty to do.\n* if the move is available or partially available, the volume is the volume\n  for the reserved quantity.\n\nWhen the module is installed on an existing database, the volume field is only\ncomputed for the stock moves of pickings not yet processed.\nThe moves in a cancelled or done picking are not updated to avoid to freeze the\ndatabase for a long time during the upgrade process if it contains a lot of\nstock moves and pickings.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_picking_volume%0Aversion:%2016.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* ACSONE SA/NV\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Laurent Mignon <laurent.mignon@acsone.eu> (https://www.acsone.eu/)\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe development of this module has been financially supported by:\n\n* ACSONE SA/NV\n* Alcyon Benelux\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-lmignon| image:: https://github.com/lmignon.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/lmignon\n    :alt: lmignon\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-lmignon| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/16.0/stock_picking_volume>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
