[see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)].\n*httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic\nstructure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also outside those areas.\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nHttk presently consists of a python library and a few programs. If you just want access to use (rather than develop)\nthe python library, and do not need the external programs, the install is very easy.\n\n(Note: for *httk* version 2.0 we will go over to a single 'script' endpoint,\n``httk``, for which the pip install step should be sufficient to get a full install.)\n\n\nInstall to access just the python library\n*****************************************\n\n1. You need Python 2.7 and access to pip in your terminal\n   window. (You can get Python and pip, e.g., by installing the Python 2.7 version\n   of Anaconda, https://www.anaconda.com/download, which should give you\n   all you need on Linux, macOS and Windows.)\n\n2. Issue in your terminal window::\n\n     pip install httk \n\n   If you at a later point want to upgrade your installation, just\n   issue::\n\n     pip install httk --upgrade\n\nYou should now be able to simply do ``import httk`` in your python programs to use the *httk* python library.\n\nAlternative install: python library + binaries + ability to develop *httk*\n**************************************************************************\n\n1. In addition to Python 2.7 and pip, you also need git.\n   You can get git from here: https://git-scm.com/ \n\n2. Issue in your terminal window::\n\n     git clone https://github.com/rartino/httk\n     cd httk\n     pip install --editable . --user\n\n   If you at a later point want to upgrade your installation, just go\n   back to the *httk* directory and issue::\n\n     git pull\n     pip install . --upgrade --user\n\n3. To setup the paths to the *httk* programs you also need to run::\n\n     source /path/to/httk/init.shell\n\n   where ``/path/to/httk`` should be the path to where you downloaded\n   *httk* in the steps above. To make this permanent, please add this\n   line to your shell initialization script, e.g., ~/.bashrc\n\nYou are now ready to use *httk*.\n\n  Notes:\n\n  * The above instructions give you access to the latest stable release of httk.\n    To get the latest developer relase (which may or may not work), issue::\n\n\t git checkout devel\n\t pip install . --upgrade --user\n\n    in your httk directory. To switch back to the stable release, do::\n\n\t git checkout master\n\t pip install . --upgrade --user\t\n\n  * An alternative to installing with ``pip install`` is to just run httk out of the\n    httk directory. In that case, skip the pip install step above and just append\n    ``source ~/path/to/httk/init.shell`` to your shell init files,\n    with ``~/path/to/httk`` replaced by the path of your httk directory.)*\n\n\n\nA few simple usage examples\n***************************\n\nLoad a cif file or poscar\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is a very simple example of just loading a structure from a ``.cif`` file and writing out some information about it.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import httk\n\n  struct = httk.load(\"example.cif\")\n\n  print(\"Formula:\", struct.formula)\n  print(\"Volume:\", float(struct.uc_volume))\n  print(\"Assignments:\", struct.uc_formula_symbols)\n  print(\"Counts:\", struct.uc_counts )\n  print(\"Coords:\", struct.uc_reduced_coords)\n\nRunning this generates the output::\n\n  ('Formula:', 'BO2Tl')\n  ('Volume', 509.24213999999984)\n  ('Assignments',['B', 'O', 'Tl'])\n  ('Counts:', [8, 16, 8])\n  ('Coords', FracVector(((1350,4550,4250) , ... , ,10000)))\n\n..\n\nCreate structures in code\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  from httk.atomistic import Structure\n\n  cell = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0] ,\n          [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] ,\n          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]\n  coordgroups = [[\n                    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]\n                 ],[\n                    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n                 ],[\n                    [0.5, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.5]\n                 ]]\n\n  assignments = ['Pb' ,'Ti' ,'O']\n  volume =62.79\n  struct = Structure.create(uc_cell = cell,\n               uc_reduced_coordgroups = coordgroups,\n               assignments = assignments,\n               uc_volume = volume)\n\n\nCreate database file, store a structure in it, and retrive it\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import httk, httk.db\n  from httk.atomistic import Structure\n\n  backend = httk.db.backend.Sqlite('example.sqlite')\n  store = httk.db.store.SqlStore(backend)\n\n  tablesalt = httk.load('NaCl.cif')\n  store.save(tablesalt)\n\n  arsenic = httk.load('As.cif')\n  store.save(arsenic)\n\n  # Search for anything with Na\n  search = store.searcher()\n  search_struct = search.variable(Structure)\n  search.add(search_struct.formula_symbols.is_in('Na'))\n\n  search.output(search_struct, 'structure')\n\n  for match, header in list(search):\n      struct = match[0]\n      print \"Found structure\", struct.formula, [str(struct.get_tags()[x]) for x in struct.get_tags()]\n\n\n\nCreate database file and store your own data in it\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.. code:: python\n\n  #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n  import httk, httk.db\n  from httk.atomistic import Structure\n\n  class StructureIsEdible(httk.HttkObject):\n\n      @httk.httk_typed_init({'structure': Structure, 'is_edible': bool})\n      def __init__(self, structure, is_edible):\n\t  self.structure = structure\n\t  self.is_edible = is_edible\n\n  backend = httk.db.backend.Sqlite('example.sqlite')\n  store = httk.db.store.SqlStore(backend)\n\n  tablesalt = httk.load('NaCl.cif')\n  edible = StructureIsEdible(tablesalt, True)\n  store.save(edible)\n\n  arsenic = httk.load('As.cif')  \n  edible = StructureIsEdible(arsenic, False)\n  store.save(edible)\n\n\n\nTutorial\n********\nUnder ``Tutorial/Step1, 2, ...`` in your *httk* directory you find a series of code snippets to run to see *httk* in action. \nYou can either just execute them there, or try them out in, e.g., a Jupyter notebook.\n\nIn addition to the Tutorial, there is a lot of straightforward examples of various things that can be done with httk\nin the ``Examples`` subdirectory. Check the source files for information about what the various examples does.\n\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nWe track our bugs using the issue tracker at github. \nIf you find a bug, please search to see if someone else\nhas reported it here:\n\n  https://github.com/rartino/httk/issues\n\nIf you cannot find it already reported, please click the 'new issue' \nbutton and report the bug.\n\nCiting *httk* in scientific works\n---------------------------------\n\nThis is presently the preferred citation to the httk framework itself:\n\n   The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk), R. Armiento et al., http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/.\n\nSince *httk* can call upon many other pieces of software quite\ntransparently, it may not be initially obvious what other software\nshould be cited. Unless configured otherwise, *httk* prints out a list\nof citations when the program ends. You should take note of those\ncitations and include them in your publications if relevant.\n\nMore info and help\n------------------\n\nInstallation: For more details on installation options refer to INSTALL.txt, distributed with *httk*.\n\nUser's guide: see USERS_GUIDE.txt, distributed with *httk*.\n\nWorkflows: for more details on how high-throughput computational workflows are\nexecuted via the runmanager.sh program, see RUNMANAGER_DETAILS.txt distributed with *httk*.\nThis may be useful if you plan to design your own workflows using *httk*.\n\nDeveloping / contributing to *httk*: refer to DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.txt distributed with *httk*.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nSee AUTHORS.txt, distributed with *httk*.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n*httk* has kindly been funded in part by:\n   * The Swedish Research Council (VR) Grant No. 621-2011-4249\n\n   * The Linnaeus Environment at Link√∂ping on Nanoscale Functional\n     Materials (LiLi-NFM) funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR).\n\nLicense and redistribution\n--------------------------\n\nThe High-Throughput Toolkit uses the GNU Affero General Public\nLicense, which is an open source license that allows redistribution\nand re-use if the license requirements are met.
