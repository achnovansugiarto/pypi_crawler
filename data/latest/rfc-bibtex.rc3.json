The deprecated version used <span style=\"color:green\">rfc-bibtex</span>.</span>\n\nAlternatively, you can clone this repository or download the `rfc-bibtex.py`. This tool has no\nexternal dependencies, so as long as you have `Python 3.x` installed, everything\nshould work fine.\n\n**Requirements**:\n\n* `Python 3.x`\n* internet connection\n\n## Testing\n\nFirst, install the test dependencies:\n\n`pipenv install --dev`\n\nor \n\n`pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`\n\nand then run:\n\n`python -m unittest discover tests`\n\nfrom the project root.\n\n# Usage\n\nThis tool automates the requests to the `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<id>/<version>/bibtex/` and `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<id>/bibtex/` endpoints.\n\n```\nusage: rfcbibtex [-h] [-f FILE_NAME] [-o FILE_NAME]\n                [inline_args [inline_args ...]]\n\nGenerate BibTex entries for IETF RFCs and Internet Drafts. The list of IDs can\nbe read from a file (including .tex and .aux) or directly from command-line\narguments.\n\npositional arguments:\ninline_args           list of RFC and/or Internet Draft IDs, in any order.\n\noptional arguments:\n-h, --help            show this help message and exit\n-f FILE_NAME, --file FILE_NAME\n                        read list of RFC and/or Internet Draft IDs from a\n                        file. Supported file formats are the following: .tex,\n                        .aux and .txt (one ID per line). If a file with any\n                        other extension is provided, the tool attempts to read\n                        it as a .txt file, containing one ID per line.\n-o FILE_NAME, --output FILE_NAME\n                        output the resulting BibTex to a file\n```\n\n## Identifier Format\n\nThe identifier format of RFCs is `rfc<rfc_num>`, where `<rfc_num>` is the RFC number.\nFor example, for the [RFC specifying TLS 1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) you\nwould write `rfc5246` (**NOTE**: the identifiers are case-insensitive, so `RFC5246` and `rFc5246` are also accepted).\n\nThe input format of Internet-Drafts(I-Ds) is `draft-<rest>`, where `<rest>` is the rest of\nthe draft's name ([all Internet-Drafts begin with \"draft\"](https://www.ietf.org/id-info/guidelines.html#naming)). For example, for the\n[TLS 1.3 Draft 21]() you would write `draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21`.\n\n## Read Inputs From Command Line\n\nExample command:\n\n`rfcbibtex RFC5246 draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21`\n\n**Output**:\n\n    @misc{rfc5246,\n            series =        {Request for Comments},\n            number =        5246,\n            howpublished =  {RFC 5246},\n            publisher =     {RFC Editor},\n            doi =           {10.17487/RFC5246},\n            url =           {https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246.txt},\n            author =        {Eric Rescorla and Tim Dierks},\n            title =         {{The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2}},\n            pagetotal =     104,\n            year =          2008,\n            month =         aug,\n            abstract =      {This document specifies Version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

The following input formats are accepted:\n\n* `.tex`: if you specify an `.tex` file, the program will search for \\cite{} commands in the file and\nextract those that appear to contain RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers.\n* `.aux`: if you specify an `.aux` file, the program will search for \\citation{} commands in the file\nand extract those that appear to contain RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers.\n* `.txt`: the program defaults to this file type if the file's extension is neither `.tex`, nor `.aux`.\nThis file type must contain a list of RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers, one per line.\n\nPlease note that the identifiers must be in the format specified in the [Identifier Format](#identifier-format) seciton.\n\n### Reading Identifiers From A .tex File\n\n<a id=\"tex-file\"></a>Consider that you have a file called `rfcs_and_ids.tex` with the following content:\n\n    \\documentclass{article}\n    \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\n    \\title{This Is A Simple Tex File For The RFCBibtex Project Demo}\n    \\author{Illya Gerasymchuk}\n    \\date{March 2019}\n\n    \\usepackage{natbib}\n    \\usepackage{graphicx}\n\n    \\begin{document}\n\n    \\maketitle\n\n    \\section{Introduction}\n    \n    There is nothing special here, nothing fancy, just a document with a few citations, like\n    \\cite{RFC5246} this one.

Those errors and warnings are printed out,\nbut **IGNORED**. The generated BibTex files are valid, even when errors are found. Errors and warnings are only printed on the console\n(into the standard error output stream) and **never to the output files** (`-o` option).\n\nHere is an example of an output of errors and warnings:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1YDLsBN.png\" alt=\"RFCBibTex Errors and Warnings Example\" width=\"50%\">",
