With SEAL, developers can write TEAL programs in a more readable and efficient way, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers alike. SEAL is built to take advantage of the easy-to-read nature of s-expressions, which makes it even easier to write and read TEAL programs. This tool is perfect for anyone looking to develop on the Algorand blockchain and write smart contracts in an efficient and streamlined way.\n\nSEAL does not add any additional layers of abstraction to the TEAL language. By building upon the existing foundations of TEAL and leveraging the readability and simplicity of s-expressions, SEAL provides a unique and innovative way of writing TEAL programs that is accessible to developers of all levels of experience. SEAL is designed to preserve the core functionality and \"opcodes\" of TEAL, while making it easier to read, write, and deploy programs on the Algorand blockchain. With SEAL, developers can benefit from a more streamlined and efficient workflow, without sacrificing the power and flexibility of TEAL. If you're looking for a tool that makes writing TEAL programs more accessible and easier than ever before, then SEAL is the perfect choice.\n\nSee a minimal example below to experience how SEAL enhances the readability and ease-of-use of TEAL:\n\n```typescript\n#pragma.version.8\n\n`This is how you construct conditional cases`\n(#in\n  (#case (== txn.ApplicationID 0)\n    (return 1)\n  )\n  (#case (== txn.OnCompletion int.OptIn)\n    (return 1)\n  )\n  (#case (== txn.OnCompletion int.NoOp)\n    (#case (== txna.ApplicationArgs.0 \"visit\")\n        b.visit\n    )\n  )\n)\nerr\n\n(visit: `natural labels`\n  ($visits (+ (app_local_get 0 \"visits\") 1)) `This is how you assign vars (scratch space)`\n  (app_local_put 0 \"visits\" $visits) `And refer`\n  (return 1)\n)\n\nerr\n\n```\n\nSimply compile your seal code to convert it to a valid TEAL language.\n\n```bash\n% seal compile demo.seal > demo.teal\n```\n\nOur `seal` code will be compiled into a perfectly valid, well organized `teal` file.\n\n```teal\n#pragma version 8\ntxn ApplicationID\nint 0\n==\nbz label_0\nint 1\nreturn\nb label_4\nlabel_0:\ntxn OnCompletion\nint OptIn\n==\nbz label_1\nint 1\nreturn\nb label_4\nlabel_1:\ntxn OnCompletion\nint NoOp\n==\nbz label_3\ntxna ApplicationArgs 0\nbyte \"visit\"\n==\nbz label_2\nb visit\nlabel_2:\nb label_4\nlabel_3:\nlabel_4:\nerr\nvisit:\nint 0\nbyte \"visits\"\napp_local_get\nint 1\n+\nstore 0 // $visits\nint 0\nbyte \"visits\"\nload 0 // $visits\napp_local_put\nint 1\nreturn\nerr\n```\n\nYou're now perfectly ready to deploy and test out your newly created smart contract.\n\n```bash\n% sandbox copyTo demo.teal\n>>> Now copying demo.teal to Algod container\n\n% sandbox goal app create [...] --approval-prog demo.teal\n>>> Created app with app index 1\n\n% sandbox goal app optin [...] --app-id 1\n>>> Transaction committed!\n\n% sandbox goal app call [...] --app-id 1 --app-arg 'str:visit'\n>>> Transaction committed!\n\n% sandbox goal app read [...] --app-id 1 --local\n>>> {\n>>>   \"visits\": {\n>>>     \"tt\": 2,\n>>>     \"ui\": 1\n>>>   }\n>>> }\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started with SEAL, simply follow the installation instructions below and once installed, you can start writing TEAL programs in s-expressions and use SEAL to convert them into TEAL bytecode that can be deployed to the Algorand blockchain.\n\n```bash\n% pip install seal\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCli tool can be accessed simply typing `seal` in your commmand prompt where you can find basic usage info prompted.\n\n```bash\n% seal\n>>> usage: seal [-h] [-v] {compile,spec} ...\n>>>\n>>> positional arguments:\n>>>   {compile,spec}\n>>>\n>>> options:\n>>>   -h, --help      show this help message and exit\n>>>   -v, --version   show program's version number and exit\n```\n\n`compile` subcommand is also as follows, please note the `strict` option to\nenable strict compiler checks. More information will be available soon.\n\n```\n% seal compile --help\n>>> usage: seal compile [-h] [-s] path\n>>>\n>>> positional arguments:\n>>>   path\n>>>\n>>> options:\n>>>   -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n>>>   -s          strict mode\n```\n\n## Documenation\n\nNo dedicated detailed documentation available yet, coming soon...\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease note that SEAL is currently in the early stages of development and while not tested it thoroughly, it may still contain bugs or errors. As such, use SEAL with caution, and always test your programs thoroughly before deploying them to the Algorand blockchain.\n\nThis software cannot be held responsible for any errors or issues that may arise from the use of it.\n\nIf you encounter any problems or have any questions about SEAL, please don't hesitate to reach out or raise an issue.\nYour support and feedback is very much appreciated.\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Kadir Pekel.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
