    "description": "Bigsheets\n#########\nOpen many huge CSV files in a click and query them with the power of\nSQL —group by, joins, etc.\n\nThis app is for convenience; just click \"open\" and select a sheet,\nheaders are auto-detected and numbers and dates just work.\n\nEach sheet is added as a table in a SQLite in RAM, so you can keep\nopening sheets and query them as regular SQL tables.\n\n.. image:: assets/app.readme.png\n\nThe UI is a native webview, which means that is smooth and\nnative-feeling while being mlutiplatform.\n\nBuilt as an useful and real exercise to master Domain Driven Design\nwith Python —if many find it useful though we can make it *more* real.\n\nDownload\n********\nThe software is multiplatform, but I have only built it on Mac, and\nthere is some care to be taken before building it for Windows and Linux:\nset the style for Windows and Linux, setup py2exe for them, and optionally\nfind a way how to use tabs in those systems.\n\nThe Mac version is here. Just download it an place it in your\n``Applications`` folder.\n\nInstallation for developers\n***************************\nTheoretically it should work on Windows and Linux –but not tested!\n\nRequirements: ``Python 3.8+`` and not a very old ``nodejs``.\n\n``pip install bigsheets``\n\nOr clone this project and ``pip install -e . -r requirements.txt``.\n\nBuilding\n========\nThe software is multiplatform, but I have only built it on Mac, and\nthere is some care to be taken before building it for Windows and Linux:\nset the style for Windows and Linux, and setup py2exe for them.\n\nMac\n---\nClone this project and install it with pip.\n\nTo create the icons you will need Affinity Designer. Open the icon\nfile and export them at the folder where the file is, then execute\n`make icons` in a terminal, generating the files pyinstaller requires.\n\nFinally execute ``make build``.\n\nTested in MacOS Catalina.\n\nArchitecture\n************\nExplained in `my blog post <https://www.bustawin.com/big-sheets>`_.\n\n*Yes, the name is a childish sad pun.*\n",
