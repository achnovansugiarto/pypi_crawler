But before doing so:\n\n* read the '[About this package](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/tree/0.0.2#about-this-package)' section of this README page;\n* consult the [documentation pages](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/tree/0.0.2#api-documentation-pages) of each API provider for the availability of their endpoint paths and data resources; and\n* review this package's [license](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/blob/0.0.2/LICENSE).\n\nAlso, bear in mind that this package is NOT part of the official Consumer Data Standards' project nor any API implementation of the Standards.\n\n## Requirements\n\nPython 3.4+\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the package's [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/cds-api-client) repository:\n\nTo install the latest version:\n\n```sh\npip install cds-api-client --user\n```\n\nTo install this specific version of the package:    \n\n```sh\npip install cds-api-client=0.0.2 --user\n```\n\n### From the package's [Github](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client.git) repository:\n\nTo install the latest version:\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client.git --user\n```\n\nTo install this specific version of the package:\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client.git@0.0.2 --user\n```\n\n## Import statement\n\nTo import the package:\n\n```python\nimport cds\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nTo access (banking) products data from a bank API that follows the Consumer Data Standards:\n\n```python\nimport cds\nfrom cds.rest import ApiException\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nconfiguration = cds.Configuration()\nconfiguration.host = 'https://data.holder.com.au' + '/cds-au/v1'  \napi_client = cds.ApiClient(configuration)\n\nproducts_api = cds.ProductsApi(api_client)\n\ntry:\n    products_list = products_api.list_products(x_v='1')  # use x_v='2' from August 2020\nexcept ApiException as e:\n    print(e)\n\npprint(products_list.data)\n```\n\nReplace `https://data.holder.com.au` with the API host address of a bank.\n\n## About this package\n\nI generated this package with an open-source Java commandline interface (CLI) tool (swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.12.jar) that I downloaded from the [Swagger Codegen Project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/#generators)'s [Maven repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/swagger-codegen-cli/2.4.12/). \n\nThe Swagger-Codegen CLI generates an API client package from a Swagger specification file -- a JSON- (or YAML-) formatted text file that lists the endpoint paths and data definitions of an API, or a group of APIs.  \n\nTo generate this package, I used a Swagger specification file of the Consumer Data Standards (1.2.0), which I downloaded from the Standards' [Github page](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards); you can find a copy of the file (cds_full.json) in the [.swagger-codegen](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/tree/0.0.2/.swagger-codegen/) directory of the package.\n\nThe Swagger-Codegen CLI generates the package's files from a set of templates that it fills with information it retrieves from the specification file. The  CLI comes with a set of generic templates built in. \n\nBefore generating this package, I extracted these built-in templates from the CLI and modified them to better document the package, and remove redundant code; you can find the templates that I used to generate the package in the [.swagger-codegen/templates](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/tree/0.0.2/.swagger-codegen/templates) directory.  \n\nIf you're interested in generating this package (or a modified version of it), have a look at this [makefile](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/blob/0.0.2/.swagger-codegen/makefile) that I created. The makefile contains a receipe for making the package.  You can find this makefile and instructions on how to use it in the [.swagger-codegen]([.swagger-codegen/templates](https://github.com/stephenmccalman/cds-python-api-client/tree/0.0.2/.swagger-codegen) directory. \n\n## What is (and isn't) in this package\n\nThis Python package contains:\n- a module (`.py`) file for each endpoint path and each data definition (that is listed in the specification file); and\n- a number of supporting files:\n    - the primary package files: configuration.py, api_client.py, rest.py, and the init.py files; and\n    - the project files: this README.md, setup.py, requirements.txt, .gitignore and .swagger-codegen-ignore.\n\nAll of these files are generated by the CLI.  The CLI (under default settings) can also generate a documentation (markdown) page and a test module for each endpoint path and each data definition. It can also generate a number of other project files, like a test-requirements.txt and a tox.ini (among other files). For simplicity, this package does not include these extra files. \n\n\n##  The Consumer Data Standards\n\nThe [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards) are a set of technical standards for implementing the Australian Government's  [Consumer Data Right](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6370) (CDR) legislation. The CDR aims to help consumers, whether they be an individual, household or a small business, find better deals on retail products and services, by\n\n* giving them greater control over their own customer data, and \n* assisting them to compare retail products and services across businesses.\n\nThe CDR requires a business to\n* provide their customers access to their own customer data -- namely account and transaction data;\n* publish specific data on retail products and services that the business offers;\n* make (both types of) data available in a standard format and through a standard process (that is set out by a Data Standards Body appointed by the Australian Government); and\n* allow individual consumers to permit a trusted third party to access their customer data on their behalf.\n\nThe Australian Government is rolling out the CDR on a sector-by-sector basis, beginning in the banking sector. It appointed the [ACCC](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0) to regulate the CDR and its roll out. In short, the ACCC determines which, and when, data fall under the CDR regime, and which third parties can access the data on behalf of a consumer.\n\nThe Government also appointed (the CSIRO's) [Data61](https://consumerdatastandards.org.au/) as the Data Standards Body. As the DSB, Data61 maintains as set of technical standards called the Consumer Data Standards. The Consumer Data Standards (among other things) set out the digital formats and processes  by which businesses must make available \"designated\" data to consumers and \"accredited\" third parties.\n\n## API documentation pages\n\nBelow lists the links to API documentation pages of the four major Australian banks:\n\n* [Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)](https://www.commbank.com.au/Developer/)\n* [National Australia Bank (NAB)](https://developer.nab.com.au/products)\n* [Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group](https://www.anz.com.au/support/anz-apis/)\n* [Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC)](https://www.westpac.com.au/about-westpac/innovation/open-banking/)\n\n## License\n\nBSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020, Stephen McCalman\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
