    "description": "アスカ\n======\n\nAsuka is a deploy system for Python web apps and it is intended to be\ndesigned to highly depend on Distribute_ (a modern fork of setuptools_),\nGitHub_, and `Amazon Web Services`_.\n\nhttp://crosspop.github.com/asuka/\n\n.. _Distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute\n.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/\n.. _Amazon Web Services: http://aws.amazon.com/\n\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThe main reason why we started to make this is to move fast we should be able\nto easily deploy web apps without much risks.  For this we're highly inspired\nby `GitHub's internal deploy system`__.\n\nHere's the list of missions we target:\n\n- Every feature (every branch) should be deployed to the testing server\n  (EC2_ instance) with isolated state for each other.  It makes features\n  able to be independently verified by collaborators.\n\n- If a feature seems to have no problem it should be able to merge into\n  the upstream (master).  Fortunately GitHub has made it very easy:\n  *pull requests*.\n\n- Every deploy should be able to anytime be rolled back including database\n  schema, in a minute at least.\n\n.. _EC2: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\n__ https://github.com/blog/1241-deploying-at-github",
