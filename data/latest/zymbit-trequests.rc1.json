    "description": "trequests\n=========\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/1stvamp/trequests.png?branch=master\n\nA Tornado async HTTP/HTTPS client adapter for python-requests.\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nYou enjoy using `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ to build fast non-blocking web applications, and you want to use a library from PyPI that makes a few HTTP requests, but pretty much every dev and their dog uses `Requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ to make HTTP requests (rightly so, because it's *awesome*), but requests has no knowledge of the event loop nor can it yield when a socket blocks, which means any time you try to use a library like that it begins to block your request handling and grud-knows what other worlds of pain.\n\nThe solution\n------------\n\nLuckily there are solutions, one such is to use the `greenlet <http://greenlet.readthedocs.org/>`_ module to wrap blocking operations and swap Tornado coroutines at the right time, there is even the handy `tornalet <https://github.com/Gawen/tornalet>`_ module which handles this for you.\n\nTo make life even easier, you lucky lucky people, I've created ``trequests``, an async Requests adapter which uses greenlets (via tornalet) and the inbuilt non-blocking HTTP client methos in Tornado, to make any call to a library (utilizing Requests) non-blocking.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    $ pip install trequests\n  \nUsage\n-----\n  \n.. code-block:: python\n    \n    # Assume bobs_big_data uses python-requests for HTTP requests\n    import bobs_big_data\n    \n    from tornado.web import RequestHandler\n    from trequests import setup_session\n    from tornalet import tornalet\n    \n    # Tell requests to use our AsyncHTTPadapter for the default\n    # session instance, you can also pass you own through\n    setup_session()\n    \n    class WebHandler(RequestHandler):\n        @tornalet\n        def get(self):\n            data = {'foo': 'bar'}\n            # This will now unblock the current coroutine, like magic\n            response = bobs_big_data.BigData(data).post()\n            return self.write(response)\n\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTo run the basic testsuite hit up `python setup.py test`.\n\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\n``trequests`` has been used in production in a large scale metrics application, and is a very small and quite simple module.\n\n**However** I've released it as ``0.9.x`` mainly because it's missing 100% compatibility with the Requests adapter API, most noticeably *cookie jar* and *session* support, which I will improve (or please send me a pull request if you fancy adding support), and release as a ``1.x`` branch when I have the time.\n\nAlso at the moment the ``setup_session`` utility actually monkey patches the ``session`` utility functions in Requests, as this was the only way I could see to override the mounts on \"default\" session instances (e.g. those created for every call when a session isn't provided). I'm hoping to change this in the future.",
