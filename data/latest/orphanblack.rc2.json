    "description": "``orphanblack``: Static Analysis for Software Clone Detection\n=============================================================\n\nCurrently for Python only, with plans to extend to C++, Java and more!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nI think things are set up with PyPI such that\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install orphanblack\n\nshould work. Because the software is in the early days, and this is my\nfirst python package, please forgive me if there are a few kinks.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n``orphanblack`` is a complex tool with plenty of settings under the hood\nfor both processing and display. Sensible defaults are used whenever\npossible. To get started, the following will analyse a single python\nmodule for clones.\n\n::\n\n    $ cd path/to/your/code\n    $ orphanblack scan *.py\n\n    ...\n\n    $ orphanblack report --verbose\n\n    Found 11 clones\n    ...\n\nIt is also possible to output results as a webpage. After scanning code,\njust run\n\n::\n\n    $ orphanblack html -o results.html\n\nIf no destination is specified, ``orphanblack`` will use ``output.html``\nin the current directory.\n\nAPI\n---\n\nNot yet done, but on the way... for now, check out the Report class\n(``orphanblack/report.py``) which summarizes the results and should be\nfairly stable.\n\nCode Genealogy (How ``orphanblack`` Came To Be)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n``orphanblack`` is a direct code descendant of a `2008 package called\n``clonedigger`` <http://clonedigger.sourceforge.net>`__. I first\nstumbled on ``clonedigger`` in 2012 when examining other static analysis\ntools for python like pep8 and pyflakes, and really liked the concept.\nSadly, I found the original code unusable for my purposes. I adapted the\ncode several times in the intervening years, but always with limited\nsuccess because of the convoluted inner workings of the package.\n\nIn the early summer of 2015, I switched to a new computer, inadvertantly\ndeleting many of my modifications. I decided to bite the bullet and\nattempt a total refactor into something I found more palatable. I also\nwanted to create something that could play nicely with Sublime Text; a\ntool that could automatically run on every project -- python or\notherwise -- I worked on. ``orphanblack``, nicknamed after the\nclone-based BBC America series, is the result of my progress towards\nthose goals.\n\nThe CLI and API are both inspired by `the wonderful dynamic analysis\ntool ``coverage.py`` <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage>`__, though\nthere is no direct code relationship.\n\nBecause ``clonedigger`` is distributed under GPL3, I am forced to also\nuse GPL3 in place of the MIT or LGPL3 liscences, which I personally\nprefer. I do not consider use of the ``orphanblack`` API to constitute\nincorporation and therefore to the greatest degree possible under the\nlaw I wish to allow the use of the API for even commercial purposes.\n\nA Short and Incomplete List of Improvements:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Use ```Click`` <http://click.pocoo.org/4/>`__ in place of\n   ```optparse`` <https://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html>`__ to\n   simplify internal code.\n-  Use ```Jinja2`` templating <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ to greatly\n   simplify the previously ad-hoc production of HTML reports.\n-  Replace janky use of ``arguments.py`` globals with the ``Parameters``\n   class.\n-  Replace CLI with something a little less difficult to understand.\n-  Provide persistent, serialiazable results reports (stored in\n   ``.orphanblack`` files when a scan is run.).\n-  Implement program-wide logging rather than ad-hoc error printouts.\n\nPlanned Features\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n-  Grouping clones! Right now, if three regions of code are all similar\n   to each other, three seperate clone reports, corresponding to each\n   pair, are generated.\n-  An API, allowing integration with other linters and plugins.\n-  Other languages: So much of this work is already done. After just a\n   little bit of internal rewriting, any language should be able to work\n   with ``orphanblack`` just by providing an appropriate AST parser.\n-  Total internal rewrite, aiming for a well commented codebase.\n-  Diffs based on anti-unification patterns.\n-  ASTNode classes with built in anti-unification utilities\n-  Ability to handle sequences elegantly (i.e. deal with insertion /\n   removal in edit distances)\n-  Configurations! (How this is implemented internally is something that\n   I've had an idea on for a while / may become it's own project. Sort\n   of like what Click is to argparse / optparse.)\n\nAn Incomplete List of Features Removed (and Reasons):\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Removed timing and profiling tools: Profiling is great, but there are\n   dedicated python profiling tools avalible.\n-  Removed diff highlighting in HTML reports: This may someday make a\n   comeback, but for now, a clean Jinja2 template far outweighs the\n   advantages of inline diffs.\n-  Formatting of code segments is less careful than before. This is a\n   temporary change pending the rewrite of internal AST representation.\n-  Removed CPD XML output. This may be added back in later, using\n   templates.\n-  Multiple settings like ``distance-threshold`` which will be added\n   again using configurations.\n\nLicense and Warranty Information\n--------------------------------\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the\nFree Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your\noption) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
