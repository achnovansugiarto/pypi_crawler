    "description": "KTiny is a Qt/KDE based client for TinyERP. Main goals for the project are \r\noutstanding integration with the KDE Desktop using the KDE Development \r\nPlatform, which means it should be available to Linux, Mac and Windows users \r\nas well as other operating systems. It's in no way supported by the TinyERP \r\nproject at the moment, though we intend to work in the same directoion of \r\nTinyERP, and give back to the whole community any features that could be \r\nuseful to other clients. Main development is currently supported by NaN \r\n(http://www.nan-tic.com) but the whole open source community is invited and \r\nencouraged to participate. All project information can be found at \r\nsourceforge. That includes users and hackers mailing lists as well as bug \r\ntracker and subversion repository. New releases will also be available there.",
