See [here](https://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/file-server/user-profile.html) for more information\n   * Python >= 3.7\n   * A bash-like shell (see [bash for windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))\n### Installation<a name=\"Installation\"></a>\n\n1. (Optional) Suggest setting up and activating a python virtual environment so as to not clutter your system python\n\n   ```shell\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   . venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n   \n2. Install the CLI:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install earthscope-cli\n   ```\n\n3. Use the CLI. The package has a `console_scripts` section which makes a shortcut called `es` available in your python environment.\n\n   ```shell\n   es --help\n   ```\n\n### Use the CLI with your user profile<a name=\"Use the CLI with your user profile\"></a>\n\n#### **Login to EarthScope with Device Authorization Flow:**\n\n```shell\nes sso login\n```\nThis will prompt your browser to open a device confirmation page with the same code displayed in the url shown on your command line.\nIf you are on a device that does not have a web browser, you can copy the displayed url in a browser on another device (personal computer, mobile device, etc...)\nand complete the confirmation there.\n\nThe **login** command will save your token locally. If this token is deleted, you will need to re-authenticate (login) to retrieve your token again.\nRun the following command to see where your token is stored:\n```shell\nes sso state --path\n```\n\n#### **get/refresh your access token**\n```shell\nes sso access --token\n```\nThe **access** command will display your access token. If your access token is close to expiration or expired, \nthe default behavior is to automatically refresh your token.\n\nIf you want to manually refresh your token:\n```shell\nes sso refresh\n```\n\nNever share your tokens. If you think your token has been compromised, please revoke your refresh token and re-authenticate (login):\n```shell\nes sso refresh --revoke\nes sso login\n```\n\n#### **Get your user profile from the `user-management-api` running behind https://data-idm.unavco.org/user/profile/**\n```shell\nes user get\n```\n\n#### **Explore the CLI**\nUse `--help` on any command to see more information on available commands and options.\n```shell\nes --help\nes sso --help\nes access --help\n.\n.\n```\n\n### Example: Retrieve a file from the UNAVCO Data File Server with cURL or Wget<a name=\"Example\"></a>\n* Step 1: login. This step is only required once (the first time you run the cli on your device) unless your access token is deleted from your device.\n* Step 2: Retrieve your token using `es sso access --token`. Add this access token as an Authorization header with your cURL or Wget command.\n\n<a name=\"curl\"></a>\nExample using cURL:\n```shell\ncurl -L -O -f --url https://data-idm.unavco.org/archive/gnss/rinex/obs/1992/001/algo0010.92d.Z --header \"authorization: Bearer $(es sso access --token)\"\n```\nwhere\n\n-L : follow redirects\\\n-O : uses server filename\\\n-f : (HTTP) Fail on error without server output. Error code 22 -- good for scripting\n\nMake sure to include the -f or it will be difficult to tell if an error occured.\n\n\n<a name=\"weget\"></a>\nExample using Wget:\n```shell\nwget https://data-idm.unavco.org/archive/gnss/rinex/obs/2022/060/p1230600.22d.Z --header \"authorization: Bearer $(es sso access --token)\"\n```\n\nSee more [file server access examples](https://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/file-server/file-server-access-examples.html)\n\nIf you would like to access files using python - please check out the [earthscope-sdk](https://gitlab.com/earthscope/public/earthscope-sdk/)\n\n### FAQ/troubleshooting<a name=\"faq\"></a>\n* **How long does my access token last?**\n  * Your access token lasts 8 hours. Once it is expired, your refresh token will need to be used to refresh your access token.\n* **How long does my refresh token last?**\n  * Your refresh token will never expire - unless you are inactive (do not use it) for one year. \n    If it does expire, you will need to re-authenticate to get a new access and refresh token.\n* **What is a refresh token and how does the CLI use it?**\n  * A refresh token is a special token that is used to renew your access token without you needing to log in again. \n    The refresh token is obtained from your access token, and using the `es sso access` command will automatically \n    renew your access token if it is close to expiration. You can 'manually' refresh your access token by using the command `es sso refresh`.\n    If your access token is compromised, you can revoke your refresh token using `es sso refresh --revoke`. Once your access token expires, \n    it can no longer be renewed and you will need to re-login.\n* **Should I hard-code my access token into my script?**\n  * No. We recommend you use the cli commands to retrieve your access tokens in your scripts. \n  This way your access token will not be compromised by anyone viewing your script. \n  The access token only lasts 8 hours and cannot be used afterwards unless refreshed.\n\nPlease contact [data-help@earthscope.org](data-help@earthscope.org) with questions or issues.\n",
