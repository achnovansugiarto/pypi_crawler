    "description": "RedisORM v0.2.0\n===============\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/JoshAshby/pyRedisORM.png?branch=master\n        :target: http://travis-ci.org/JoshAshby/pyRedisORM\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/JoshAshby/pyRedisORM/badge.png\n        :target: https://coveralls.io/r/JoshAshby/pyRedisORM\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/v/RedisORM/badge.png\n    :target: https://crate.io/packages/RedisORM/\n    :alt: Latest PyPI version\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/RedisORM/badge.png\n    :target: https://crate.io/packages/RedisORM/\n    :alt: Number of PyPI downloads\n\n\nRedisORM is just a quick and simple little Key-Value group to Python Object\nmapper that makes it easier to have somewhat more complex structures in Redis.\nWhile a similar structure could be achieved by using a Redis hash, this module\nalso allows for lists and future support for Redis data\nstructures is hopefully planed, making this more helpful than basic hashs.\n\nThere is a small test suite provided. It requires an actual Redis install that\nis up and running. If you want too change the address then please take a look\nin the test directory. The tests are automatically ran each commit,\nthanks to `travis-ci.org <http://travis-ci.org>`__ and coverage is provided by\n`Coveralls.io <http://coveralls.io>`__ and this documentation\nis kindly hosted and automatically rebuilt by `readthedocs.org\n<http://readthedocs.org>`__.\n\n\nA Few Minor Warnings\n--------------------\n#. This is a very early release, and although I've been using a large part of\n   this code for about a year now, things are still going to break and not\n   function well. Don't be afraid to submit a bug report or a patch on Github\n   to fix something.\n#. I'm only a second year university student, and software\n   isn't even my major; I'm working towards an Electrical and Computer\n   Engineering degree, so not only do I have limited time to keep this\n   maintained, but I also probably won't write the best code ever.\n#. This project follows the semantic versioning specs. All Minor and\n   patch versions will not break the major versions API, however a bump of the\n   major version signifies that backwards compatibility will most likely be\n   broken in some way.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nFor more information, a short quick start, and information about running the\ntest suit, please `read the documentation\n<https://pyredisorm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ kindly hosted\non `readthedocs.org <http://readthedocs.org>`__\n\nContributing\n------------\nAll code for this can be found online at\n`github <https://github.com/JoshAshby/pyRedisORM>`__.\nIf something is broken, or a feature is missing, please submit a pull request\nor open an issue. Most things I probably won't have time to get around to\nlooking at too deeply, so if you want it fixed, a pull request is the way\nto go. In your pull request please provide an explanation as to what your\nrequest is for, and what benefit it provides. Also, please try to match the\nstyle of the code, or make sure your code is nearly all PEP8 compliant just to\nmaintain code consistency.\n\nBesides that, this project is licensed under the MIT License as found in the\n``LICENSE.txt`` file.
