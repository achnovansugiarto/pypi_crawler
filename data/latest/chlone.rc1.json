    "description": "Its main product is a library with four interface levels available for CGNS application developpers:\r\n\r\n        **CHLone python module**\r\n        C1 the CGNS/MLL clone, same API as CGNS/MLL with a different implementation,\r\n        F2 the Fortran Facilities, a user interface based on paths and node access and designed for fortran users,\r\n        L3 the Low Level Library, manages raw HDF5 nodes\r\n\r\nA CGNS/HDF5 file has an HDF5 layout that can be read or write by any application using MLL functions as well as CHLone functions. The resulting file you obtain using CHLone is the same as a file obtained using CGNS/MLL, the change is the actual implementation of the HDF5 function calls performed.",
