    "description": "devpi-server: consistent pypi.python.org cache, github-style internal indexes\n=============================================================================\n\n* `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues>`_, `repo\n  <https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi>`_\n\n* IRC: #devpi on freenode, `mailing list\n  <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/devpi-dev>`_ \n\n* compatibility: {win,unix}-py{26,27,34}\n\nconsistent robust pypi-cache\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``\nindex, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted\n**and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and\ngreatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when\noffline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.\n\ngithub-style indexes\n---------------------------------\n\nEach user can have multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via\nstandard ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users, indexes (and soon projects\nand releases) are manipulaed through a RESTful HTTP API.\n\nindex inheritance\n--------------------------\n\nEach index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves\nboth its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an\nindex using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a\nrelease candidate before you push it to PyPI.\n\ngood defaults and easy deployment\n---------------------------------------\n\nGet started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment\nincluding pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. \n\nseparate tool for Packaging/Testing activities\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool\nhelps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and\ninstallation workflows.\n\nSee http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n2.5.3 (2015-11-23)\n------------------\n\n- fix a bug that resulted from accessing a non-existing project on \n  root/pypi where upstream does not contain the X-PYPI-LAST-SERIAL\n  header usually.  Thanks Matthias Bach.\n\n2.5.2 (2015-11-20)\n------------------\n\n- recognize \"pex\" for redirections of user/index/NAME to\n  user/index/+simple/NAME just like we do with pip/setuptools.\n\n- fix py2 incompatibility introduced with 2.5.1 where we used\n  a unicode header and pyramid only likes str-headers.\n\n2.5.1 (2015-11-20)\n------------------\n\n- fix issue289: fix simple page serving on replicas\n\n\n2.5.0 (2015-11-19)\n------------------\n\n- fix a regression of 2.3.0 which would cause many write-transactions\n  for mirrored simple-page entries that didn't change.  Previous to the fix,\n  accesses to mirrored simple pages will result in a new\n  write-transaction every 30 minutes if the page is accessed which\n  is likely on a somewhat busy site.  If you running with replicas\n  it is recommended to do an an export/import cycle to remove all \n  the unneccessary writes that were produced since devpi-server-2.3.0.\n  They delay the setup of new replicas considerably.\n\n- add info about pypi_whitelist on simple page when root/pypi is blocked for\n  a project.\n\n- replica simple-page serving will not unneccessarily wait for new \n  simple-page entries to arrive at the replication side if the master \n  does not return any changes in the initial simple-page request.\n  Previously a replica would wait for the replication-thread to catch\n  up even if no links changed.\n\n- fix setup.py to work on py34 and with LANG=\"C\" environments.\n  Thanks Jason R. Coombs.\n\n- fix issue284: allow users who are listed in acl_upload to delete packages\n\n\n2.4.0 (2015-11-11)\n------------------\n\n- NOTE: devpi-server-2.4 is compatible to data from devpi-server-2.3 but\n  not the other way round.  Once you run devpi-server-2.4 you can not go\n  back. It's always a good idea to make a backup before trying a new version :)\n\n- NOTE: if you use ``--logger-cfg`` with .yaml files you will need to\n  install pyyaml yourself as devpi-server-2.4 dropped it as a direct\n  dependency as it does not install for win32/python3.5 and is \n  not needed for devpi-server operations except for logging configuration.\n  Specifying a ``*.json`` file always works.\n\n- add timeout to replica requests\n\n- fix issue275: improve error message when a serverdir exists but has no\n  version\n\n- improve testing mechanics and name normalization related to storing doczips\n\n- refine keyfs to provide lazy deep readonly-views for\n  dict/set/list/tuple types by default.  This introduces safety because\n  users (including plugins) of keyfs-values can only write/modify a value\n  by explicitly getting it with readonly=False (thereby deep copying it)\n  and setting it with the transaction.  It also allows to avoid unnecessary\n  copy-operations when just reading values.\n\n- fix issue283: pypi cache didn't work for replicas.\n\n- performance improvements for simple pages with lots of releases.\n  this also changed the db layout of the caching from pypi.python.org mirrors\n  but will seamlessly work on older data, see NOTE at top.\n\n- add \"--profile-requests=NUM\" option which turns on per-request\n  profiling and will print out after NUM requests are executed\n  and then restart profiling.\n\n- fix tests for pypy. We officially support pypy now.",
