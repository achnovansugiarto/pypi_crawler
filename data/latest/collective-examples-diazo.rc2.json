    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nThis package shows how you might use collective.xdv / Diazo in a Plone site. It\naims to be more verbose (and probably more redundant) than xdv-worked-example_.\n\nIt's aimed towards developers, and it focuses especially on adding worked\nexamples of more complex XSLT.  Eventually we're hoping to get the code\nexamples in the xdv package itself, as they're not specific to Plone.\n\n.. contents:: Contents\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInclude collective.examples.diazo in your buildout.\n\nThere's a buildout on\nhttps://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.examples.diazo/trunk/buildout.\nIt won't work on Mac...yet.  But you can install collective.xdv on a Mac using\nstatically compiled lxml, don't use the buildout contained here, but use the\ncollective.examples.diazo by checking out the source to your /src directory\nand updating your own buildout.cfg and re-running buildout -N.\n\nExamples in this package\n------------------------\n\nWe do not have a single `static` directory. Instead, we have directories \nfor each theme.\n\nThemes:\n\n`collective-xdv-example`: the example from the collective.xdv product.\n\nCredits / Who to bug \n--------------------\n\nPackage created during the sprint after the Plone Conference 2010.\n\nTeam:\n\n- Jamie Lentin\n- Ken Wasetis\n- Laurence Rowe\n- Peter Uittenbroek\n- Kees Hink\n\n.. _xdv-worked-example: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.xdv#a-worked-example\n\nCollective.xdv worked example\n-----------------------------\n\nThe initial rulesfile was taken from the collective.xdv documentation.\nTo this, we added:\n\nMultiple themes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe want to use a different theme for the \"News\" section. This is done using the\n<theme> directive. \n\nWe did this by setting a selector for the body element's content class::\n    \n    <theme href=\"theme.html\" />\n    <theme \n        href=\"theme-news.html\" \n        css:if-content=\"body.section-news\"\n        />\n\nNote that we have to set the fallback theme. Failing to do so will result in an\nunthemed page.\n\nTo use a specific theme for a content type, you can use another selector for\nthe body element's class, ie::\n\n    <theme href=\"theme.html\" />\n    <theme \n        href=\"theme-news.html\" \n        css:if-content=\"body.portaltype-folder\"\n        />\n\nYou could also theme for a specific template in this way.\n\nThis only works on xdv >= 0.4b3, which the current KGS does\nnot include. To force the right version of xdv, add this to your buildout::\n\n    [versions]\n    xdv = 0.4b3\n\nIncluding extra rules files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo include an extra rules file, use the XInclude statement. You could use this\nstatement to slit up a large rules file into separate files.\n\nFor example, this rule in `rules.xml` calls another rules file `rules-standard.xml`::\n\n    <!-- Stuff that happens on all pages -->\n    <xi:include href=\"rules-standard.xml\" />\n\nThis one executes the `rules-document.xml`, but only for Plone Document\nobjects::\n\n    <!-- Stuff that happens on Plone's Documents (standard pages) only -->\n    <rules css:if-content=\"body.portaltype-document\">\n        <xi:include href=\"rules-document.xml\" />\n    </rules>\n\n\n\nThe orange_sunset theme example\n-------------------------------\n\n- The Orange Sunset theme was downloaded from oswd.org, a site with \n  Open Source Web Design templates.\n- The original static HTML/CSS theme was developed by D Carter, while the \n  this collective.xdv-based theme was developed in collaboration with \n  the members of the Diazo sprint at the Bristol, U.K. Plone Conference, \n  October 30th, 2010. \n- Terms:  The downloaded zip file from oswd.org has a CSS file that refers\n  to a license.txt that does not exist, but the author's website indicates\n  the terms of the themes developed by DCarter.  These terms indicate that\n  this theme should generally maintain the 'Design by DCarter' attribution\n  in the footer of the page, or that a contribution should be made to its\n  creator.  More information at:  http://www.dcarter.co.uk/terms.html\n- Recommendation: This Diazo/xdv theme is meant to provide a nice reference\n  for developers and designers who wish to leverage Diazo to theme their \n  own Plone-based websites (although the contained rules.xml could provide\n  useful tips on rules syntax when attempting to use standalone XDV (or as\n  part of a WSGI pipeline) to theme any type of web application.  This\n  theme is not intended to be leveraged to theme your website directly. \n\nHopefully. you'll find it useful as an example when building your own \nDiazo themes.\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou have obviously already installed the collective.examples.xdv product \nthat contains the orange_sunset theme and its directory containing static\nHTML, image, and CSS files.\n\nOnce you have installed the collective.examples.xdv product in your Plone \nsite via the Site Setup -> Add Ons area (click checkbox next to this product \nand then click the 'Activate' button.)\n\nOnce you have activated the product, click on the new 'XDV theme' configlet \nlink under the Add-on Configuration section of Site Setup.\n\nIn the 'Theme template' field enter:\npython://collective.examples.diazo/static/orange_sunset/index.html\n\nIn the 'Rules file' field enter:\npython://collective.examples.diazo/static/orange_sunset/rules.xml\n\nIn the 'Absolute URL Prefix' field enter::\n\n    /++resource++collective.examples.diazo/orange_sunset\n\nYou can modify the 'Domains' box to use the IP and/or port that will work for reaching your \nPlone site.  It typically defaults to port :8080 on localhost, but if your Zope is running\non port 6000, change it to that.\n\nBe sure to have the 'Enabled' checkbox at the top checked in order to \nhave this theme applied to your site.\n\nNote:  Do not try to enter '127.0.0.1:your-port' as one of the themed domains in your \nconfiguration, as the 127.0.0.1 address has been reserved, so that you always have a \nway to get back to viewing the unthemed-through-Diazo Plone website (in case you \nbreak your theme so badly when modifying your rules file that it renders the site \nunviewable.)\n\n\nExtending\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can modify the rules.xml file in this distribution to adjust the existing theme \nmapping rules, create your own, or whatever.\n\nTo create your own theme, you might copy/paste the orange_sunset directory in \nthis product's /static directory, rename the new directory to a unique name \nfor your new theme, and then copy in whatever static html/css/images you'd like \nto use under that directory, as well as modify the rules.xml file in your new\nDiazo theme directory.  We hope this jumpstarts your Diazo theme development!\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.2 (2010-10-30)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release, PloneConf2010.",
