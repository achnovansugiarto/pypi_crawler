    "description": "PyVISA\n======\n\nA Python package for support of the \"Virtual Instrument Software\nArchitecture\" (VISA), in order to control measurement devices and\ntest equipment via GPIB, RS232, Ethernet or USB.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe programming of measurement instruments can be real pain. There are many\ndifferent protocols, sent over many different interfaces and bus systems\n(GPIB, RS232, USB). For every programming language you want to use, you have to\nfind libraries that support both your device and its bus system.\n\nIn order to ease this unfortunate situation, the Virtual Instrument Software Architecture\n(VISA_) specification was defined in the middle of the 90'. Today VISA is implemented on\nall significant operating systems. A couple of vendors offer VISA libraries, partly\nwith free download. These libraries work together with arbitrary peripherical devices,\nalthough they may be limited to certain interface devices, such as the vendor’s GPIB card.\n\nThe VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G (LabVIEW’s graphical\nlanguage. However, you can use VISA with any language capable of calling functions in a DLL.\nPython is such a language.\n\n.. _VISA: http://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/default.aspx\n\n\nVISA and Python\n---------------\n\nPython has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement controlling:\n\n- Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.\n- It represents a high abstraction level [2], which perfectly blends with the abstraction\n  level of measurement programs.\n- It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting modules for\n  data analysis and visualisation.\n- A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is available.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- VISA (tested with NI-VISA 3.2, WinXP, from www.ni.com/visa)\n- Python (tested with 2.6 and 3.2+)\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\nUsing pip:\n\n    $ pip install pyvisa\n\nor easy_install:\n\n    $ easy_install pyvisa\n\nor download and unzip the source distribution file and:\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nThe documentation can be read online at https://pyvisa.readthedocs.org\n\n\nPyVISA was originally programmed by Torsten Bronger and Gregor Thalhammer, Innsbruck, Austria. It is based on earlier experiences by Thalhammer.\n\nIt was maintained from March 2012 to August 2013 by Florian Bauer.\nIt is currently maintained by Hernan E. Grecco <hernan.grecco@gmail.com>.\n\nOther contributors, listed alphabetically, are:\n\n* bauflo3 <bauflo3@516c0664-e049-0410-bc6e-8f9a6051a51d>\n* bkstein <Bernd.Krietenstein@rohde-schwarz.com>\n*
