You may need to convert the tabs into spaces for it to be compatible with your project.\n\nAdditionally - please make sure that our license notice is kept visible as a docstring on the `Pip` class, and/or\nat the top of the file if you use it as an independent file. Our `./minify.sh` script automatically injects a small, \nbasic license notice at the top of the file, and under the Pip class as a docstring after minification.\n\nYou can generate your own minified version of `pipwrapper.py` by running `./minify.sh` after setting up\na development environment ( `git clone; cd pipwrapper; pip3 install -r requirements.txt;`).\n\nWe also occasionally publish a minified file on [the Releases Page](https://github.com/Privex/pipwrapper),\nwhich can either be copy pasted into an existing script, or saved to a `.py` file and imported from.\n\nIf something is wrong with our minification script that results in the license notice not being added, or you manually\ntrim `pipwrapper.py` down to an appropriate size for your project - please make sure to add our license notice as a \ndocstring under `class Pip`, or at the top of the file. \n\nHere is our small and simple license notice for minified versions:\n\n```py\n\"\"\"\n(C) Copyright 2021 -

i.e. 'install', 'uninstall', 'auto_install', 'call', and\n# any of the other pre-defined classmethod's - then you should be able to call them directly\n# via the class, e.g. Pip.auto_install('privex-helpers', 'Quart', 'dnspython')\n#\npip = Pip()\n\n########\n# Automatically install any of these specified packages if they aren't already installed\nres = pip.auto_install('privex-helpers', 'Django', 'requests', 'httpx')\n\nif res.retcode != 0:\n   print(\"Something went wrong while installing packages using auto_install.\")\n   print(\"Output from Pip was:\")\n   print(\"\\n\", res.stdout.decode(), \"\\n\\n\")\n########\n# Directly run 'pip install -U' for one or more packages\npip.install(\"psycopg2\", \"mysqlclient\")\n\n########\n# Uninstall one or more packages\npip.uninstall(\"requests\")\n\n########\n# Let's install 'requests' again, but this time, using 'output=True' to pipe pip's stdout/stderr\n# directly to the console of this script, instead of capturing the output into a variable.\npip.install('requests', output=True)\n\n########\n# You can also call .freeze() to run 'pip freeze', which will capture the output, and will parse the lines of package==version\n# into a standard Python list() for you to be able to process easily.\nfrz = pip.freeze()\n\nprint(frz)\n# [\n#     \"asgiref==3.3.1\", \"async-property==0.2.1\", \"attrs==20.3.0\",\n#     \"Django==3.1.7\", \"httpx==0.17.1\",\n#     \"privex-helpers==3.2.1\", \"privex-loghelper==1.0.6\",\n#     \"python-dateutil==2.8.1\", \"pytz==2021.1\",\n#     \"requests==2.25.1\", \"sniffio==1.2.0\",\n#     \"urllib3==1.26.4\"\n# ]\n\n########\n# Alternatively, instead of using .freeze(), you can use .installed_packages() (a wrapper around .freeze()) to generate a \n# list of plain package names that are currently installed :)\npkgs = pip.installed_pkgs()\n\nprint(pkgs)\n# [\n#     'asgiref', 'async-property', 'attrs', 'certifi', 'chardet', 'Django', 'h11', \n#     'httpcore', 'httpx', 'idna', 'privex-helpers', 'privex-loghelper', 'python-dateutil',\n#     'pytz', 'requests', 'rfc3986', 'six', 'sniffio', 'sqlparse', 'urllib3'\n# ]\n\n\n########\n# While only a handful of pip sub-commands have wrapper method available, you can call any arbitrary undefined attribute\n# like a command method, then it will dynamically generate and return a function that will call the sub-command with that name,\n# and it'll pass any positional arguments directly to the sub-command.\n# \n# For example, as of v0.5.0 (27 Mar 2021), the '.show()' method does not exist on the Pip class, however, if you call .show()\n# with the name of an installed package like below, it will dynamically generate a function that will run 'pip show ARGS...'\n# and return a ProcResult just like the defined command wrapper methods :)\nres_show: ProcResult = pip.show('privex-helpers')\nprint(res_show.stdout.decode())\n# Name: privex-helpers\n# Version: 3.2.1\n# Summary: A variety of helper functions and classes, useful for many different projects\n# Home-page: https://github.com/Privex/python-helpers\n# Author: Chris (Someguy123) @ Privex\n# License: MIT\n# Location: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages\n# Requires: python-dateutil, async-property, sniffio, privex-loghelper, attrs\n# Required-by: privex-db\n\n```\n\n# Information\n\nThis Python PIP library has been developed at [Privex Inc.](https://www.privex.io) by @someguy123 to make it easy to work with\n`pip` within a Python script -

( https://www.privex.io )\n\n\n# Install\n\nWe recommend that you use at least Python 3.6+ due to the usage of parameter and return type hinting.\n\n### Install from PyPi using `pip`\n\nYou can install this package via pip:\n\n```sh\npip3 install -U pipwrapper\n```\n\n### (Alternative) Manual install from Git\n\nIf you don't want to PyPi (e.g. for development versions not on PyPi yet), you can install the \nproject directly from our Git repo.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason to manually install it, you **should install it using pip3 normally**\nas shown above.\n\n**Option 1 - Use pip to install straight from Github**\n\n```sh\npip3 install git+https://github.com/Privex/pipwrapper\n```\n\n**Option 2 - Clone and install manually**\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository from Github\ngit clone https://github.com/Privex/pipwrapper.git\ncd pipwrapper\n\n# RECOMMENDED MANUAL INSTALL METHOD\n# Use pip to install the source code\npip3 install .\n\n# ALTERNATIVE INSTALL METHOD\n# If you don't have pip, or have issues with installing using it, then you can use setuptools instead.\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe're very happy to accept pull requests, and work on any issues reported to us. \n\nHere's some important information:\n\n**Reporting Issues:**\n\n - For bug reports, you should include the following information:\n     - Version of `pipwrapper` - use `pip3 freeze`\n        - If not installed via a PyPi release, git revision number that the issue was tested on - `git log -n1`\n     - Your python3 version - `python3 -V`\n     - Your operating system and OS version (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10)\n - For feature requests / changes\n     - Please avoid suggestions that require third party dependencies. This tool is designed to be lightweight, not filled with\n       external dependencies.\n     - Clearly explain the feature/change that you would like to be added\n     - Explain why the feature/change would be useful to us, or other users of the tool\n     - Be aware that features/changes that are complicated to add, or we simply find un-necessary for our use of the tool \n       may not be added (but we may accept PRs)\n\n**Pull Requests:**\n\n - We'll happily accept PRs that only add code comments or README changes\n - Use 4 spaces, not tabs when contributing to the code\n - You can use features from Python 3.4+ (we run Python 3.7+ for our projects)\n    - Features that require a Python version that has not yet been released for the latest stable release\n      of Ubuntu Server LTS (at this time, Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic) will not be accepted. \n - Clearly explain the purpose of your pull request in the title and description\n     - What changes have you made?\n     - Why have you made these changes?\n - Please make sure that code contributions are appropriately commented - we won't accept changes that involve \n   uncommented, highly terse one-liners.\n\n**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**\n\nNobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.\n\nIf you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by Privex, such as code or \ndocumentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open \nsource license that applies to our project.\n\nIf you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content\nin a separate file, making sure that the license of your content is clearly displayed at the start of the \nfile (e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). \n\nYou should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed\nseparately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able\nto accept your contribution.\n\nIf you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `privex_contribution_agreement.txt`.\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the **X11 / MIT** license.
