    "description": "\n## What is this  about?\nImagine you want to compare various iterations of a table or data file. You may need to ensure that your versions of a \nlist that is maintained by more than one person or system are same. When you have to solve this manually, it is \ndifficult. So, let's make use of this library right now!\n\n## How does it work?\nThe script takes the ID value of an entry from the first table, searches for it in the second table, and sees \nif it can find it there. If it does not, it will list this entry as a table 1 entry that was not found in table 2. \nThis will occur in the opposite direction for table 2 versus table 1. Furthermore, the script compares the values of \nentries with the same ID and, if they differ, lists the differences.\n\n## What does it require?\nEach table entry must have a unique identifier, also known as a key value. \nThis could be an order number or an employee number, for example, but it could \nalso be any other characters as long as it is unique to an entry. This key value \nmust be located in your table's first column. The order of the other columns, \nand also the overall order of the rows, is completely irrelevant. \nwe hope this library saves you some time!\n\nVersion Release Beta\n==========\n0.0.3 (06/07/2022)\n-------------------\n\n----------\n\nUsage\n-------------------\nInstall the published library:\n\n    pip install df_lib_syren\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n    from df_lib_syren import syr_compareDF\n    \n    source =  '/source file path/'\n    target =  '/target file path/'\n    \n    compare_dfs = syr_compareDF(source_file = source, target_file= target)\n\n",
