    "description": "\n# `gnucash-uk-vat`\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a utility which manages HMRC (UK) VAT returns in accordance with\nHMRC MTD directives for users of the GnuCash accounting system.  It can\nstudy your GnuCash accounts, compare this with your HMRC VAT obligations,\nand produce the VAT return to meet your obligations.  As an optional step,\nonce the VAT return is filed, a bill can be posted describing the VAT\nowing, and posted to an Accounts Payable account.\n\n## Discuss\n\nThere's a #gnucash-uk-vat channel on our Discord server if you want\nto discuss... https://discord.gg/3cAvPASS6p\n\n## A word from our sponsors :)\n\nIf you need low cost, automated accounts filing for small businesses,\nAccounts Machine has a commercial offering which incorporates the\nfunctionality you see here in a web service.\n\nThe proposition is simple.  Accounts Machine does not offer an\naccounting system.  You manage your accounts using GnuCash or anything\nwhich produces CSV output.  You manage your accounts, manage your\ninvoices, manage receipts, and record everything in your application\nunder your control.  When it comes to filing returns, you upload your\naccounts to accountsmachine.io and use the system to file VAT returns,\ncorporation tax returns, and company accounts with Companies House.\nThe production of returns is as automated as possible.  Accounts\nproduction conforms to iXBRL specifications, and HMRC VAT MTD.\n\nThis service is able to simplify accounts filing for simple businesses.\nYour company should be a Limited Company, conform to micro-entity\nrequirements, and have a single trade.  This service is aimed at making\nlife easier for startups and small businesses.\n\nThe roadmap is for launch in 2Q2022.  VAT filing is complete, just going\nthrough the final validation process with HMRC.\n[Demo is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMIPaSKxuWNScTD_0-tdmwexLYWCzTAv/view?usp=sharing)\n\nVisit https://accountsmachine.io.  Accounts Machine is registered with HMRC\nand Companies House for filing purposes and have successfully filed VAT,\ncorp tax and company accounts.\n\nJoin our discord service to keep on top of latest progress:\nhttps://discord.gg/3cAvPASS6p\n\nEnthusiastic early adopters will find free deal links on the Discord\nserver.  Looking forward to filing for you. :)\n\n## GnuCash backends\n\nTwo ways of interacting with your GnuCash accounts are supported:\n- The `gnucash` module is bundled only with Linux GnuCash packages, and can\n  only by used on Linux.\n- The `piecash` module is pure Python and can be obtained from package\n  repositories.  This module only supports GnuCash files saved in\n  Sqlite files or a Postgres database.  You can convert a GnuCash XML file into\n  Sqlite by using the \"Save As...\" option in GnuCash.\n\n## Status\n\nThis is a command-line utility, with a GTK-based dialog mode which removes\nthe need to know about configuration files or command-line options.\nI have used this to submit my own VAT returns.  If you want to join the\nparty come to the #gnucash-uk-vat channel on Discord server \nhttps://discord.gg/3cAvPASS6p and I'll try to help you through the process.\n\n## Credentials\n\nIn order to use this, you need production credentials (client ID and secret)\nfor the VAT submission API.  HMRC does not permit these credentials to be\nshared publicly:\n\n> We have checked with our colleagues who look after HMRCâ€™s API\n> Platform. They have advised that this is not allowed and would be likely\n> to result in your Developer Hub application being blocked. We recommend\n> that instead of sharing these credentials that you inform your users how\n> they can register for their own Developer Hub application and use its\n> credentials with your code.\n\nYou can either apply for production credentials using\nthe HMRC developer portal (you need to register), or contact me as I can\nshare a few credentials privately.\n\nDeveloper hub: \nhttps://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub\n\nYou click 'Get production credentials' and enter details about the\napplication.  I call this application `gnucash-uk-vat`.  When you apply for\ncredentials, HMRC will contact you to fill in an application.  You could\nmention that the application has already been approved for production\ncredentials, and the application headers verified by testing on the\nsandbox under the application identifier\n`d865cdd5-2aae-4630-9d2a-7c26ad797b2e`.\n\nOnce you have credentials, you should put them in the `config.json` file in\nthe `application` section placeholders.\n\n## Installing\n\n```\npip3 install git+https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-uk-vat\n```\n\nSee [Installing](docs/installation.md).\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two modes:\n- [Assist mode](docs/assist.md), which is a GTK-based dialog-driven.\n  This automates everything including configuration file setup.\n- [CLI mode](docs/cli.md), which is purely CLI-based and has no\n  dependency on PyGTK.\n\n## GnuCash accounts structure\n\nSee [Accounts](docs/accounts.md).\n\n## Local test service\n\nThere is a local test service which allows you to emulate the HMRC VAT\nservice with test data under your control.\n\nSee [local test](docs/local-test.md).\n\n## Sample accounts\n\nA sample account file is included at `accounts/accounts.gnucash`.  This\naccount file contains some transactions dated in the 1Q17 quarter which match\nthe test data in HMRC's Sandbox.  There are also some transactions in 2020\nwhich match the obligations in the `dummy-vat-service` data.\n\n# Licences, Compliance, etc.\n\n## Privacy\n\n`gnucash-uk-vat` is hosted by you.  It runs on your computer, accesses\ninformation from your accounts, and forwards data using the HMRC APIs.\nEverything is within your control.  No other network systems are used, and no\ninformation is transmitted to other parties.\n\nAdditional data (configuration and credentials) is stored on your\nfilesystem under your control and you should manage the credential\nfiles as you would any password or other secret.\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021, Cyberapocalypse Limited\nCopyright (c) 2021-2022, Accounts Machine Limited\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
