Written on top of Pyramid and Ember.js\n\nServer code: https://github.com/lorenzogil/yith-library-server\n\nThis web client lets the user access to his passwords and secrets, safely\nstored at the Yith Library server. View, editing and deleting are supported.\n\nThere is an instance running at http://yithlibrary.com/\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIt's recommended to use virtualenv. To know how to create an isolated\nenviroment with virtualenv read this http://www.virtualenv.org\n\nRequirements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Python 2.7 or Python 3.2\n\nDeployment\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter loading your virtualenv (you should be using one!), run this command::\n\n    python setup.py develop\n\nThis will install all the dependencies needed. After the installation is\ncompleted, you can execute the server with this command::\n\n    pserve development.ini\n\nAnd then the web client will be available at http://localhost:6543/\n\nBoring legal stuff\n------------------\n\nYith Library Webclient\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n| Copyright (C) 2012 Yaco Sistemas S.L.\n| Copyright (C) 2012 Alejandro Blanco <alejandro.b.e@gmail.com>\n| Copyright (C) 2012 Lorenzo Gil <lorenzo.gil.sanchez@gmail.com>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
