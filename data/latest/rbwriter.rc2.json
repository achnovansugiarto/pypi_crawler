    "description": "# Report Booklet Writer\n\n[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/thecoder777/report-booklet-writer/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/thecoder777/report-booklet-writer)\n[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/rbwriter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/rbwriter)\n\nNever write a report booklet on your own again, Report Booklet Writer does it for you!\n\n[Only supports German (DE) standard report booklets right now]\n\n\n\n## About\n\nThis Project let's you save all your reports from single weeks into one big database, and when you feel like it, you can export all weeks correctly ordered and pixel perfect aligned into one PDF. Isn't that awesome?\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Native Nginx & UWSGI support\n- Native Docker & Buildah support (relatively untested, be careful!)\n\n- Multi-User-Management\n- Todolist integration\n- Report Booklet Overview\n- Export-Everything-Button\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### From PyPI (recommended):\n\n```bash\npip install rbwriter\n\n# Run it\n# -> make sure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH or you installed it with sudo for all users\nrbwriter\n```\n\n\n\n### From GitHub (build from source):\n\n```bash\n# First clone the project\ngit clone https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer.git\n\n# Change directory\ncd Report-Booklet-Writer\n\n# OPTIONAL: checkout the release you want\n# git checkout v0.1-alpha.1\n\n# Install requirements\npip install .\n\n# Run it \n# -> make sure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH or you installed it with sudo for all users\nrbwriter\n```\n\n\n\n### From GitHub releases:\n\n- [Download](https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer/releases) the wheel (.whl) file from the releases section  (get the release you want)\n- install with `pip install *.whl`\n- run with `rbwriter`\n\n\n\n### With Docker:\n\n```Python\n# First clone the project\ngit clone https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer.git\n\n# Change directory\ncd Report-Booklet-Writer\n\n# OPTIONAL: checkout the release you want\n# git checkout v0.1-alpha.1\n\n# build container (make sure Docker is installed and working!)\ndocker build -t \"some-example-tag\" .\n\n# run container\ndocker run -p 80:80 \"some-example-tag\"\n\n# stop container\ndocker stop \"some-example-tag\"\n```\n\n\n\n### With Podman / Buildah:\n\n```Python\n# First clone the project\ngit clone https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer.git\n\n# Change directory\ncd Report-Booklet-Writer\n\n# OPTIONAL: checkout the release you want\n# git checkout v0.1-alpha.1\n\n# build container (make sure Buildah and Podman are installed and working!)\nbuildah build-using-dockerfile -t \"some-example-tag\"\n\n# run container\npodman run \"some-example-tag\"\n\n# stop container\npodman stop \"some-example-tag\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nStart rbwriter, go to [localhost:80](localhost:80) (current default) and either click on 'create account' click the quickedit icon on sidebar (try to hover for a little bit!) or click on 'Use as Guest'.\n\nThat's it!\n\nYou can now either download the single PDFs in 'edit' mode, or export all to one PDF in the overview tab!\n\n\n\n\n## Users\n\nEvery account has a nickname that can be changed in the settings (it's pretty useless right now, but you'll use this to login later!)\n\nYou Email needs to be in a `name@provider.domain` format\n\nYour password needs to have:\n\n- 8 characters\n- one capital letter\n- one number\n- one special character\n\nNow you're logged in! **Congratulations!**\n\n\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure all settings via the web interface on /settings or by clicking on the settings icon in the sidebar!\n\nDo me a favor and be careful with some settings like `start week` and `start year`, this often gets easily messed up.\n\n\n\nIf you like the extreme, or you just want to mess around, you may also edit the `defines/configs.py` file. (Do this on your own risk!)\n\nYou'll be notified if everything went the correct way when you click the save button!\n\nTo reset the configuration, just click the reset button! (This is to reset the values you put in since the last refresh)\n\nThe 'reset to default button' will hard reset your configuration to absolute defaults, with **no chance to restore your data**, so please be careful with that!\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### The `rbwriter` command doesn't exist:\n\n If the `rbwriter` command doesn't exist, you probably haven't set up your PATH correctly.\n\nMake sure that `~/.local/bin` (local installation) and `/usr/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/` (global installation) are both on your PATH!\n\nYou can check your path with `echo $PATH`.\n\n\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nYou can easily debug the project by using a 'debug' flag when running:\n\n```bash\nrbwriter debug\n```\n\nThis will launch an instance of the flask development server on the default [localhost:5000](localhost:5000).\n\n#### Flask flags:\n\nAll flags given to `rbwriter` will be handed over directly to the `flask run` command!\n\n\n\n## Long-Term Todos\n\n- Use a different Database structure!\n  - Maybe SQLAlchemy\n  - Every user has its own table (not a completely different database...)\n- Mail server (just wait for it, you'll see)\n- Private/Public Profile setting\n- all TODOs in the code (`# TODO: ...`)\n- More flexible export (e.g. export from week 45 to 51 in 2021)\n- Multiple PDF templates\n  - Mappings for easier support\n  - Select the PDF template before export (standard template in settings)\n- New Frontend (right now it's pretty un-scalable for further features)\n- Recommended Todolist-tasks to tick after saving a report booklet\n- Progress of how much of the Todolist is done (on the Todolist page / stats page)\n- Make a stats page with cool stats (how much words written or something like this)\n- Search-bars everywhere\n\n\n\n## License\n\nThe project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer/blob/stable/LICENSE).\n\n\n\n------\n\nThis project has guidelines for:\n\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer/blob/stable/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) \n- [Contributing](https://github.com/TheCoder777/Report-Booklet-Writer/blob/stable/CONTRIBUTING.md) \n\n\n\nCurrent maintainer and owner: [TheCoder777](https://github.com/thecoder777)\n\n**Cheers!**\n\n\n\n",
