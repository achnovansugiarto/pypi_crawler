At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.\n\nü§ó Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries ‚Äî [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) ‚Äî with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.\n\n## Online demos\n\nYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). We also offer [private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API](https://huggingface.co/pricing) for public and private models.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n In Natural Language Processing:\n- [Masked word completion with BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased?text=Paris+is+the+%5BMASK%5D+of+France)\n- [Name Entity Recognition with Electra](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/electra-large-discriminator-finetuned-conll03-english?text=My+name+is+Sarah+and+I+live+in+London+city)\n- [Text generation with GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2?text=A+long+time+ago%2C+)\n- [Natural Language Inference with RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli?text=The+dog+was+lost.+Nobody+lost+any+animal)\n- [Summarization with BART](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn?text=The+tower+is+324+metres+%281%2C063+ft%29+tall%2C+about+the+same+height+as+an+81-storey+building%2C+and+the+tallest+structure+in+Paris.+Its+base+is+square%2C+measuring+125+metres+%28410+ft%29+on+each+side.+During+its+construction%2C+the+Eiffel+Tower+surpassed+the+Washington+Monument+to+become+the+tallest+man-made+structure+in+the+world%2C+a+title+it+held+for+41+years+until+the+Chrysler+Building+in+New+York+City+was+finished+in+1930.+It+was+the+first+structure+to+reach+a+height+of+300+metres.+Due+to+the+addition+of+a+broadcasting+aerial+at+the+top+of+the+tower+in+1957%2C+it+is+now+taller+than+the+Chrysler+Building+by+5.2+metres+%2817+ft%29.+Excluding+transmitters%2C+the+Eiffel+Tower+is+the+second+tallest+free-standing+structure+in+France+after+the+Millau+Viaduct)\n- [Question answering with DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad?text=Which+name+is+also+used+to+describe+the+Amazon+rainforest+in+English%3F&context=The+Amazon+rainforest+%28Portuguese%3A+Floresta+Amaz%C3%B4nica+or+Amaz%C3%B4nia%3B+Spanish%3A+Selva+Amaz%C3%B3nica%2C+Amazon%C3%ADa+or+usually+Amazonia%3B+French%3A+For%C3%AAt+amazonienne%3B+Dutch%3A+Amazoneregenwoud%29%2C+also+known+in+English+as+Amazonia+or+the+Amazon+Jungle%2C+is+a+moist+broadleaf+forest+that+covers+most+of+the+Amazon+basin+of+South+America.+This+basin+encompasses+7%2C000%2C000+square+kilometres+%282%2C700%2C000+sq+mi%29%2C+of+which+5%2C500%2C000+square+kilometres+%282%2C100%2C000+sq+mi%29+are+covered+by+the+rainforest.+This+region+includes+territory+belonging+to+nine+nations.+The+majority+of+the+forest+is+contained+within+Brazil%2C+with+60%25+of+the+rainforest%2C+followed+by+Peru+with+13%25%2C+Colombia+with+10%25%2C+and+with+minor+amounts+in+Venezuela%2C+Ecuador%2C+Bolivia%2C+Guyana%2C+Suriname+and+French+Guiana.+States+or+departments+in+four+nations+contain+%22Amazonas%22+in+their+names.+The+Amazon+represents+over+half+of+the+planet%27s+remaining+rainforests%2C+and+comprises+the+largest+and+most+biodiverse+tract+of+tropical+rainforest+in+the+world%2C+with+an+estimated+390+billion+individual+trees+divided+into+16%2C000+species)\n- [Translation with T5](https://huggingface.co/t5-base?text=My+name+is+Wolfgang+and+I+live+in+Berlin)\n\nIn Computer Vision:\n- [Image classification with ViT](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224)\n- [Object Detection with DETR](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50)\n- [Semantic Segmentation with SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512)\n- [Panoptic Segmentation with DETR](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50-panoptic)\n\nIn Audio:\n- [Automatic Speech Recognition with Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h)\n- [Keyword Spotting with Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks)\n\nIn Multimodal tasks:\n- [Visual Question Answering with ViLT](https://huggingface.co/dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa)\n\n**[Write With Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co)**, built by the Hugging Face team, is the official demo of this repo‚Äôs text generation capabilities.\n\n## If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/support\">\n    <img alt=\"HuggingFace Expert Acceleration Program\" src=\"https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/marketing/transformers/new-support-improved.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">\n</a><br>\n\n## Quick tour\n\nTo immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n>>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}]\n```\n\nThe second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.97%.\n\nMany tasks have a pre-trained `pipeline` ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:\n\n``` python\n>>> import requests\n>>> from PIL import Image\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Download an image with cute cats\n>>> url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"\n>>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw\n>>> image = Image.open(image_data)\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for object detection\n>>> object_detector = pipeline('object_detection')\n>>> object_detector(image)\n[{'score': 0.9982201457023621,\n  'label': 'remote',\n  'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}},\n {'score': 0.9960021376609802,\n  'label': 'remote',\n  'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}},\n {'score': 0.9954745173454285,\n  'label': 'couch',\n  'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}},\n {'score': 0.9988006353378296,\n  'label': 'cat',\n  'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}},\n {'score': 0.9986783862113953,\n  'label': 'cat',\n  'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}]\n```\n\nHere we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the right, with the predictions displayed on the left:\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample_post_processed.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\n</h3>\n\nYou can learn more about the tasks supported by the `pipeline` API in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary).\n\nIn addition to `pipeline`, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\n\nAnd here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\n\nThe tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.\n\nThe model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. [This tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.\n\n## Why should I use transformers?\n\n1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.\n    - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\n    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\n    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n\n1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n    - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\n    - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\n    - Dozens of architectures with over 60,000 pretrained models across all modalities.\n\n1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:\n    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\n    - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.\n    - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation and production.\n\n1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.\n    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.\n    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n\n## Why shouldn't I use transformers?\n\n- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.\n- The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)).\n- While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\n\n## Installation\n\n### With pip\n\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.6+, Flax 0.3.2+, PyTorch 1.3.1+ and TensorFlow 2.3+.\n\nYou should install ü§ó Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n\nFirst, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.\n\nThen, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow.\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) and/or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax#quick-install) and [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) installation pages regarding the specific install command for your platform.\n\nWhen one of those backends has been installed, ü§ó Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\n```\n\nIf you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must [install the library from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#installing-from-source).\n\n### With conda\n\nSince Transformers version v4.0.0, we now have a conda channel: `huggingface`.\n\nü§ó Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:\n\n```shell script\nconda install -c huggingface transformers\n```\n\nFollow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda.\n\n> **_NOTE:_**  On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching. If this is not an option for you, please let us know in [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/1062).\n\n## Model architectures\n\n**[All the model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models)** provided by ü§ó Transformers are seamlessly integrated from the huggingface.co [model hub](https://huggingface.co) where they are uploaded directly by [users](https://huggingface.co/users) and [organizations](https://huggingface.co/organizations).\n\nCurrent number of checkpoints: ![](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/models&color=brightgreen)\n\nü§ó Transformers currently provides the following architectures (see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_summary) for a high-level summary of each them):\n\n1. **[ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/albert)** (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper [ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942), by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.\n1. **[BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart)** (from Facebook) released with the paper [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer.\n1. **[BARThez](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/barthez)** (from √âcole polytechnique) released with the paper [BARThez: a Skilled Pretrained French Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12321) by Moussa Kamal Eddine, Antoine J.-P.
