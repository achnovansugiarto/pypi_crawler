    "description": "***************\nedrnsite.search\n***************\n\nThis product, ``edrnsite.search``, provides customized searching and search\nresults for the EDRN_ Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to make\nit easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's collective\nknowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers, specimens,\ninvestigators, participants, studies, protocols, etc.\n\nAlthough intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any\nPlone_ compatible site.\n\nThis software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,\noperated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.\n\n.. References:\n.. _EDRN Informatics Center: http://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _EDRN: http://edrn.nci.nih.gov/\n.. _EKE: http://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/applications/knowledge-environment\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _NCI: http://cancer.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n* Add ``edrnsite.search`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n \n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        edrnsite.search\n        \n* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n  \n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    ...\n    zcml =\n        edrnsite.search\n        \n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    % ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file.\n\n.. References:\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nWhat follows is a history of changes from release to release.\n\n1.1.5 — Upgrades\n----------------\n\n* Made compatible with Plone 4.2.4.\n* Made compatible with edrn.theme-1.2.2\n\n\n1.1.4 — Spit & Polish\n---------------------\n\nThis release happens to cover the following:\n\n* CA-883 - Syntax error in edrnsite/search/tests/base.py\n* Made compatible with Plone 4.1.5.\n\n\n1.1.3 — Test Support\n--------------------\n\nThis release includes:\n\n* Depending on just Plone the framework instead of Plone the application.\n* Updating to the plone.app.testing fixtures.\n\n\n1.1.2 - Simpler Specimens\n-------------------------\n\nThis release removes the tests for searches of specimens, since specimens have\nbeen vastly simplified.\n\n\n1.1.1 - Upgrade Cleanup\n-----------------------\n\nThis release updates the GenericSetup profile to 4 and adds upgrade steps to\nthat profile.\n\n\n1.1.0 - Plone 4\n---------------\n\nThis release makes edrnsite.search compatible with Plone 4.\n\n\n1.0.1 - Specimen Search\n-----------------------\n\nThis time around, the search package works with the new fields in the EKE\nspecimen package and the fact the package no longer delegates to the ERNE UI\nfor specimen display.  (There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker\nfor this new feature; or if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write\nthis and can't confirm.)\n\n\n1.0.0 - Prime Time\n------------------\n\nThis release addresses a number of issues that make this component (and some\nof its selected counterparts) \"prime time\" for the operational NCI portal.\n\nThis release addresses the following issues:\n\nYou can find the issue tracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA\n\n\n0.0.2 - Specimen Search - 2010-08-09\n------------------------------------\n\nThis release added free-text search that matched ERNE specimens provided by\nthe ``eke.specimens`` package.\n\n\n0.0.1 - Undocumented Release\n----------------------------\n\nThe changelog failed to be updated for this release.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Unreleased\n------------------\n\nInitial release into beta.\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright 2009-2010 by the California Institute of Technology.
