Main features:\r\n\r\n\t- Equilibrium constant as a function of temperature\r\n\r\n\t- Heat of reaction as a function of temperature\r\n\r\n\r\nHandy tools:\r\n\r\n\t- Units conversion module\r\n\r\n\t- Hundreds of physical constants\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for further details and examples.\r\n\r\nCurrently running 'pip3 install thermopy3' as root install files to a weird folder.
