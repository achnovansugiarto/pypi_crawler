    "description": "msssPy\n======\n\nAn `ms`/`msms` file reader for Python.\n\n> Pronounced “Mississippi”\n\nThis reader is enhanced over basic ms file readers, in that it keeps a cache\nindices for each file it reads, which significantly speeds of random access\nto individual samples within a multiple-replicate ms file.\n\nThis can be especially useful for machine learnings tasks, during which ms\nfiles need to be randomly accessed multiple times.  Files already seen (by\nthe same process) are read much more quickly than the first time they are\naccessed within that process.  A future version will also add cache\npersistence.\n\nAdditionally, `mssspy` adds the ability to plug in different \"reader\"\nimplementations that use different parsing algorithms.  Currently two\nbuilt-in readers are included, the \"slow\" reader which is more\nfault-tolerant and provides better error reporting, and a \"faster\" reader\nwhich assumes correctly formatted ms files, while sacrificing more careful\nvalidation.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nTo read an ms file, the main high-level interface is the `MSFile` class.\nSimply open a file like:\n\n```python\n>>> import mssspy\n>>> msf = MSFile('path/to/simulations.ms')\n```\n\nYou can then access the individual replicates in the file, or \"samples\"\nusing index notation:\n\n```python\n>>> msf[0]\nSample(haplotypes=array([[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n       [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]], dtype=uint8), positions=array([0.283, 0.55 , 0.589, 0.715, 0.988]))\n```\n\nThis is the case even if there is only one sample in the file, `msf[0]`.\n\nIf you intend to read multiple samples from the same file while it's open,\nit is also more efficient to use `MSFile` in a `with` statement, e.g.:\n\n```python\n>>> with MSFile('path/to/simulations.ms') as msf:\n...     all_samples = list(msf)\n```\n\n**Note:** The is currently not a way to get the length of the file in\nsamples.  E.g. `len(msf)` does not work.  This is because it would require\nscanning through the entire file to count the number of samples, which would\nbe inefficient.  However, this capability will be added in a future release.\n\nIn the meantime, you can still iterate over the `MSFile` which will try each\npossible index starting from `0` until an `IndexError` is raised.  In other\nwords, that's why `list(msf)` works.\n\nAnd that's basically it!\n\nAdvanced Usage\n--------------\n\nTODO\n\nTODO List for Future Releases\n-----------------------------\n\n* Add \"fast\" reader written in C(ython) and compare its performance to\n  the existing \"faster\" reader.\n\n* More thorough parsing (e.g. support for `time:` and tree data parsing).\n\n* Support for writing.\n\n* More thorough documentation including API documentation.\n\n\n",
