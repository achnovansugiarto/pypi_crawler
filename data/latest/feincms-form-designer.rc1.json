    "description": "==================================================\nForm Designer - a simple form designer for FeinCMS\n==================================================\n\nThis form designer does not try to offer every last configuration possibility\nof Django's forms, just through the administration interface instead of\ndirectly in Python code. Instead, it strives to be a tool which everyone can\nuse right away, without the need for long explanations.\n\nIt offers a small set of predefined input fields such as:\n\n* Text fields (One line and multi line widgets possible)\n* E-mail address fields\n* Checkboxes\n* Dropdowns\n* Radio Buttons\n* Multiple selection checkboxes\n* Hidden input fields\n\nEvery field can optionally be declared mandatory, default values and help texts\nare available too. That's it.\n\nBy default, form data is sent by e-mail to a freely definable e-mail address\nand stored in the database (a CSV export of saved submissions is provided too).\nIt is possible to add your own actions, but that's not documented yet. These\nactions aren't hardcoded -- they can be freely defined for every form defined\nthrough this form designer.\n\n\nConfiguring the export\n======================\n\nThe CSV export of form submissions uses the Python's CSV module, the Excel\ndialect and UTF-8 encoding by default. If your main target is Excel, you should\nprobably add the following setting to work around Excel's abysmal handling of\nCSV files encoded in anything but latin-1::\n\n    FORM_DESIGNER_EXPORT = {\n        'encoding': 'latin-1',\n    }\n\nYou may add additional keyword arguments here which will be used during the\ninstantiation of ``csv.writer``.\n\n\nVisit these sites for more information\n======================================\n\n* form_designer: https://github.com/matthiask/form_designer\n* FeinCMS: http://www.feinheit.ch/labs/feincms-django-cms/",
