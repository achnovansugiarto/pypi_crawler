    "description": "# Calculate priority of the activities\n--------------------------------------\nThis project was born after readning the comments in [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15686211) of HackerNews.\nThis application writes a file with a list of the activites and their priority (numeric index: 1 highest priority, 2 less prioritary, etc).\nIn detail:\n* The application reads two existing files:\n1. activity-date.csv (Activity,Start,End) about the duration of an activity\n2. activity-importance.csv (Activity,Importance) about the importance of an activity. The meaning of importance is relative and vague. A definition can be: if you have two activites A and B in the same time, A is more important of B if doing A you can earn more money (or, lose less money) than doing B.\n* The application writes one file ordered-activities.csv (Activity, Priority)\n\n\n## Feature\n\n[O] The input files can have a different order of the activities each other (now the order has to be the same, otherwise an Exception will be run)\n[O] The final list can be separated in \"activities already started\" (start date minor than today) and \"future activities\" (start date major than today)\n[O] The final list can be separated by the area of interest of the project (Area of responsability in GTD meaning)\n\n## Bug\n\n[X] Fix the unit test\n[O] Resolve the TODO in the code\n[O]  Organize the structure following the guidelines in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/)\n\n## Status CI Integration\n\nI use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.0+\n- pip\n- pytest \n\n### Installing\n\n- Clone the project with *git-clone* (or download directly it)\n- Have fun!\n\n## Running the tests\n\n- In this version the unit test are inside the module and are not completed. TDD, sorry :(\n\n### Break down into to end to end tests\n\nNo indications\n\n### Coding styles sheets\n\nPlease read the file [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Deployment\n\n - No package built (sorry, I'm a beginner in Python :) )\n - Run    **>>> python Main.py**\n\n### Built with:\n\n* [ViM](http://www.vim.org) - one of the best text editor I know\n* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - most famous library about the testing in Python\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the details about the code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
