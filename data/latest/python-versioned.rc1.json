    "description": "Versioned v0.1\n==============\n\nVersioning is a user-friendly interface to a very common way of\nversioning files, which creates a snapshot on every save, using\nhardlinks, with ``latest.ext`` always referring to the latest version\nand other versions named according to when they were created.\n\nYou can use it on the command line or from Python.\n\n**Status:** unstable.\n\nUsage:\n\n::\n\n    versioned (init | update) <dest> [options]\n    versioned rm <dest> [options]\n    versioned ls <dest> [options]\n    versioned <dest> [<src>] [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n::\n\n    -s --max-size <size>        Prune old snapshots to keep the directory under a certain size.\n    -n --max-snapshots <n>      Prune snapshots beyond the latest <n>.\n    -d --max-days <days>        Prune snapshots older than <days>.\n    -r --range <range>...       List snapshots in a range. Get the latest snapshot using `head`, \n                                a range of older snapshots using `-5 -2`, snapshots that are\n                                between a certain age using `-9d -4d` and snapshots from a \n                                certain year, month or day using `2014`, `2014-05` and so on.\n    -k --keep                   When adding a file from <src> to the versioned directory, \n                                also keep the file in its original location.\n\nArguments: The path to either the versioned directory or the file you\nwish to start versioning. The path to the file that should be\n\nWhen initializing a versioned directory, you should refer to it with the\ndesired extension of the files that it will contain at the end.\n``example.txt`` will result in a versioned directory called ``example``\nbeing created, and all the files therein will have the ``.txt``\nextension. From then on, you can refer to your versioned directory with\nor without extension tacked on.",
