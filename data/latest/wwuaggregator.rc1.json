    "description": "# Description\nThe purpose of this Python module is to take a dataframe of detail-level data and return aggregated results.  We initially created it because SQL Server does not handle all aggregations (ex. median), and we wanted a workflow where detail-level data from SQL could be snapshotted when publishing a report but aggregated datasets would actually delievered in the end (since aggregated data helps to protect sensitive information).  This module performs the aggregation-portion of the workflow.\n\nThis module is built upon [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), which is built upon [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  Using Polars/Rust allows us to compute aggregations incredibly efficiently compared to traditional Python multiprocessing due to reduced memory-requirements and compiled code; in short, it is \"closer to the metal\" of the machine, and we obtain processing times that are easily one-tenth of our previous Python pandas/multiprocessing-implementation.\n\nTo use our WWU_Aggregator module, simply install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install wwuaggregator\n```\n\n# Usage\n## Simple use-case\nFor this first example of usage, we will perform a sum of students in each college (College A, B, and C) over two years (2021 and 2022).\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom wwuaggregator import WWU_Aggregator\n\nagg = WWU_Aggregator()\n\ndata = [{'college':'College A', 'year': '2021', 'students':1000 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'year': '2022', 'students':1200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'year': '2021', 'students':500 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'year': '2022', 'students':700 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'year': '2021', 'students':1800 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'year': '2022', 'students':1900 }]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nresults = agg.operations(\n\t[\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"sum\",\"column\":\"students\"}\n\t]\n) \\\n.dimensions_constant([['college']]) \\\n.dataframe(df) \\\n.execute()\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\n\nResult:\n\n```\n     college  students_sum\n0  College A          2200\n1  College B          1200\n2  College C          3700\n```\n\n\n## Aggregating multiple sets of dimensions\nIn many of our reports, we want to have different sets of aggregation.  For example, we might want to get numbers by college for all years (like the example above), but we might also want the data broken out by college and year as well.\nWe can specify these groupings by supplying a list of lists to the *dimensions_constant*-parameter like this:  `.dimensions_constant([['college'], ['college','year']])`\n\nFurthermore, we might also have a set of dimensions that want a report-user to be able to filter by in a dashboard we are creating.  We call these \"change dimensions\", and their presence expands the groupings to include the *dimensions_constant* as well as the Cartesian-product of *dimensions_constant* and *dimensions_change*.  This means that the user will be able to filter the dashboard by the given criteria and still obtain the aggregated results for the data specified by *dimensions_constant*.\n\nIn our example below, we sum the number of students by college and then also by college/year - while also adding department as a filter for the report.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom wwuaggregator import WWU_Aggregator\n\nagg = WWU_Aggregator()\n\ndata = [{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2021', 'students':1000 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2022', 'students':1200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2021', 'students':200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2022', 'students':300 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2021', 'students':500 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2022', 'students':700 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2021', 'students':50 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2022', 'students':75 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2021', 'students':1800 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2022', 'students':1900 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2021', 'students':1100 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2022', 'students':1250 }]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nresults = agg.operations(\n\t[\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"sum\",\"column\":\"students\"}\n\t]\n) \\\n.dimensions_constant([['college'], ['college','year']]) \\\n.dimensions_change([['department']]) \\\n.dataframe(df) \\\n.execute()\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\n\nResult:\n\n```\n      college    department  students_sum agg_dim$names agg_dim$values  year\n0   College A  Department 1          2200    department   Department 1   NaN\n1   College A  Department 2           500    department   Department 2   NaN\n2   College B  Department 3          1200    department   Department 3   NaN\n3   College B  Department 4           125    department   Department 4   NaN\n4   College C  Department 5          3700    department   Department 5   NaN\n5   College C  Department 6          2350    department   Department 6   NaN\n6   College A  Department 1          1000    department   Department 1  2021\n7   College A  Department 2           200    department   Department 2  2021\n8   College A  Department 1          1200    department   Department 1  2022\n9   College A  Department 2           300    department   Department 2  2022\n10  College B  Department 3           500    department   Department 3  2021\n11  College B  Department 4            50    department   Department 4  2021\n12  College B  Department 3           700    department   Department 3  2022\n13  College B  Department 4            75    department   Department 4  2022\n14  College C  Department 5          1800    department   Department 5  2021\n15  College C  Department 6          1100    department   Department 6  2021\n16  College C  Department 5          1900    department   Department 5  2022\n17  College C  Department 6          1250    department   Department 6  2022\n18  College A           NaN          2700                                NaN\n19  College B           NaN          1325                                NaN\n20  College C           NaN          6050                                NaN\n21  College A           NaN          1200                               2021\n22  College A           NaN          1500                               2022\n23  College B           NaN           550                               2021\n24  College B           NaN           775                               2022\n25  College C           NaN          2900                               2021\n26  College C           NaN          3150                               2022\n```\n\n\nNote that entries of NaN signify that the data were not grouped by that dimension.  For example, line 18 was grouped only by college (since department and year are both NaN); however, line 6 was grouped by college, department, and year.\nAdditionally, this output contains new variables named *agg_dim$names* and *agg_dim$values*.

Line 0's (Department 1's) value of 2200 is 81% of College A's (all departments) students.  Line 1's (Department 2's) value of 500 is 18.5% of College A's (all departments) students.\n\nNow let's look at lines 6 through 17.  These lines are aggregated by college, departmnet, and year.  For line 6, the value of 1000 (College A/Department 1/Year 2021) is 37% of College A's students (all departments/all years).\n\nFor line 18, it is aggregated by college.  College A's value of 2700 students is 100% of College A's students.\n\nFor lines 21 and 22, it is aggregated by college and year.  Line 21's value of 1200 (College A/Year 2021) is 44% of College A's students (all years).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that we can also compute the percent of total for the entire set.  In our example above, we got 100% for each college on lines 18 - 20.  What if we wanted to know what percentage of students are associated with College A for the entire university?  To handle this scenario, we can pass a wildcard value of \"*\" for the \"of_total\"-value:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom wwuaggregator import WWU_Aggregator\n\nagg = WWU_Aggregator()\n\ndata = [{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2021', 'students':1000 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2022', 'students':1200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2021', 'students':200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2022', 'students':300 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2021', 'students':500 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2022', 'students':700 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2021', 'students':50 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2022', 'students':75 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2021', 'students':1800 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2022', 'students':1900 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2021', 'students':1100 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2022', 'students':1250 }]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nresults = agg.operations(\n\t[\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"sum\",\"column\":\"students\"},\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"percent_of_total_numeric\",\"column\":\"students\", \"of_total\":[\"*\"]},\n\t]\n) \\\n.dimensions_constant([['college'], ['college','year']]) \\\n.dimensions_change([['department']]) \\\n.dataframe(df) \\\n.execute()\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n      college    department  students_sum agg_dim$names agg_dim$values  students_percent_of_total_numeric  year\n0   College A  Department 1          2200    department   Department 1                           0.218362   NaN\n1   College A  Department 2           500    department   Department 2                           0.049628   NaN\n2   College B  Department 3          1200    department   Department 3                           0.119107   NaN\n3   College B  Department 4           125    department   Department 4                           0.012407   NaN\n4   College C  Department 5          3700    department   Department 5                           0.367246   NaN\n5   College C  Department 6          2350    department   Department 6                           0.233251   NaN\n6   College A  Department 1          1000    department   Department 1                           0.099256  2021\n7   College A  Department 2           200    department   Department 2                           0.019851  2021\n8   College A  Department 1          1200    department   Department 1                           0.119107  2022\n9   College A  Department 2           300    department   Department 2                           0.029777  2022\n10  College B  Department 3           500    department   Department 3                           0.049628  2021\n11  College B  Department 4            50    department   Department 4                           0.004963  2021\n12  College B  Department 3           700    department   Department 3                           0.069479  2022\n13  College B  Department 4            75    department   Department 4                           0.007444  2022\n14  College C  Department 5          1800    department   Department 5                           0.178660  2021\n15  College C  Department 6          1100    department   Department 6                           0.109181  2021\n16  College C  Department 5          1900    department   Department 5                           0.188586  2022\n17  College C  Department 6          1250    department   Department 6                           0.124069  2022\n18  College A           NaN          2700                                                        0.267990   NaN\n19  College B           NaN          1325                                                        0.131514   NaN\n20  College C           NaN          6050                                                        0.600496   NaN\n21  College A           NaN          1200                                                        0.119107  2021\n22  College A           NaN          1500                                                        0.148883  2022\n23  College B           NaN           550                                                        0.054591  2021\n24  College B           NaN           775                                                        0.076923  2022\n25  College C           NaN          2900                                                        0.287841  2021\n26  College C           NaN          3150                                                        0.312655  2022\n```\n\nFor our particular question, we want to focus on lines 18 - 20, where it is aggregating by college only.  On line 18, the value of 2700 is 26.8% of the total students at the university for all departments and years (10,705).  Likewise, the other rows are being compared to the entirety of the set as well - for example, line 0's value of 2200 is also being compared to 10,705 and thus results in a calculation of 21.8%.  You will note that each grouping adds up to 100% (ex. lines 0 through 5, which are grouped by college and department).\n\n## Calculations of the complement\nIn many of our scenarios, we'd like to compare one member of a set against its complement.  For example, perhaps we want to compare one professor's grades against the median-value of his or her peers' grades.  Or - using the dataset above - perhaps we want to know one college's student numbers against the mean of all the other colleges' student numbers.  In such scenarios, we want to pull the member of the set out of the distribution when computing the aggregation so that we are not comparing the member to itself.  We have a handful of operations that perform this kind of work in the aggregator:\n\n* count_of_complement\n* count_distinct_of_complement\n* max_of_complement\n* mean_of_complement\n* median_of_complement\n* min_of_complement\n* std_of_complement\n* sum_of_complement\n\nHere is a college's number of students compared with the mean of the other colleges:\n\n```python\nimport pandas

look at line 18.  College A has a total of 2700 students, and the other colleges have an average of 921.875 students.  ...What?  How does that work?  Since B has 1325 and C has 6050, shouldn't have an average of something closer to 3600?\nIn this case, it was computing mean_of_complement at the department-level even though it was computing it for the college (i.e., it removed College A from the dataset and computed the mean of the remaining records - which happened to be at department-level aggregation).  Thus, (500 + 700 + 50 + 75 + 1800 + 1900 + 1100 + 1250) / 8 = 921.875.\n\nIn order to get a number closer to the 3600 that we expect, we will instead need to aggregate our data at the desired level (college) first and then perform the mean_of_complement.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom wwuaggregator import WWU_Aggregator\n\ndata = [{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2021', 'students':1000 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 1', 'year': '2022', 'students':1200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2021', 'students':200 },\n\t\t{'college':'College A', 'department':'Department 2', 'year': '2022', 'students':300 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2021', 'students':500 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 3', 'year': '2022', 'students':700 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2021', 'students':50 },\n\t\t{'college':'College B', 'department':'Department 4', 'year': '2022', 'students':75 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2021', 'students':1800 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 5', 'year': '2022', 'students':1900 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2021', 'students':1100 },\n\t\t{'college':'College C', 'department':'Department 6', 'year': '2022', 'students':1250 }]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# sum things at the college-level\nsummation_agg = WWU_Aggregator()\nsummation = summation_agg.operations(\n\t[\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"sum\",\"column\":\"students\"},\n\t]\n) \\\n.dimensions_constant([['college']]) \\\n.dataframe(df) \\\n.execute()\n\n# perform aggregation at the college-level of a college against its complement\nagg = WWU_Aggregator()\nresults = agg.operations(\n\t[\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"max\",\"column\":\"students_sum\"},\n\t\t{\"operation\":\"mean_of_complement\",\"column\":\"students_sum\",\"of_complement\":[\"college\"]},\n\t]\n) \\\n.dimensions_constant([['college']]) \\\n.dataframe(summation) \\\n.execute()\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n     college  students_sum_max  students_sum_mean_of_complement\n0  College A              2700                           3687.5\n1  College B              1325                           4375.0\n2  College C              6050                           2012.5\n```\n",
