It's way faster than this Python implementation.)\n\n**What is Reso?**\n\n * Reso is a digital logic circuit graphical programming language!\n * Reso is a digital logic circuit simulator.\n * Reso program outputs other Reso programs.\n * Reso is *not* a cellular automata, despite similarities.\n * Reso is *not* useful or good yet, but I hope you can still have fun with it.\n\nA Reso program is a circuit described by a bitmap image, and the output is another valid Reso program, updating the wire states (on or off). This is described as a pure function, but for performance, it maintains a compiled graph between iterations.\n\nBecause images are valid circuits, you can copy-and-paste smaller components to build up more complex circuits using your favorite image editor!\n\nThis implementation is (1) slow (it's in Python!) and (2) not-interactive (you can't edit circuits live!) I hope you can have fun with this despite those limitations. :)\n\n**Check out a pure Rust implementation from ashirviskas here: [https://github.com/ashirviskas/rust_reso/](https://github.com/ashirviskas/rust_reso/)**\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThis requires **Python 3**, **Numpy** and **Pillow>=9.0.0**. It's tested on Python 3.6, Numpy 1.21.2, and Pillow 9.0.1. (Don't use Pillow < 9.0.0, it has serious security vulnerabilities.)\n\n**Install from PyPi:**\n\n```\n    python -m pip install reso\n```\n\n\n**Install directly from repo:**\n\n```\n    python -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/reso\n```\n\n(This should work. I think.) \n\n**Build from source as:**\n\n```\n    git clone git@gitlab.com:lynnpepin/reso.git --depth 1\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip # upgrade pip\n    python -m pip install --upgrade build # install build\n    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n    cd reso\n    python -m build\n\n    # Optional: Run tests\n    cd tests\n    python tests_for_regionmapper.py\n    python tests.py\n```\n\n**Run tests**\n\n```\n```\n\nIt is recommended to run `git clone` with flag `--depth 1` since the examples, slides, etc. in this repository makes it heavy.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThis implementation of Reso supports command line usage. Input is a single image, and outputs are iterations of the Reso simulation of the circuit described in the first image.\n\n### Command line\n\nHere's an example: Load `~/helloworld.png`, *iterate* (`-n`) 12 times, and *save* (`-s`) the results to `~/hello_00.png`, `~/hello_01.png`, ... `~/hello_04.png`, printing information *verbosely* (`-v`) along the way:\n\n\n```\npython -m reso ~/helloworld.png -n 12 -s hello_ -v\n```\n\nIf you only wanted to save the end result, add the \"-o\" flag, as such:\n\n```\npython -m reso ~/helloworld.png -n 12 -s hello_ -v -o\n```\n\nAnd here is the full command-line usage:\n\n```\nusage: reso.py load_location [--numiter NUMITER] [--save SAVE] [--outputlast] [--verbose]    \n\npositional arguments:\n  load_location         Location to load image from\n\nother arguments:\n  --save SAVE, -s SAVE  Prefix to save images to.\n  --numiter ITERATE, -n ITERATE\n                        iterate the reso board n times. Defaults to 1.\n  --outputlast, -o      Only save the final iteration of the board.\n  --verbose, -v         Print extra information; useful for debugging.\n\n```\n\n### Palette\n\nThe palette is an important part of Reso! You can define a circuit using an image. Any pixel with a color in this palette of eight colors has semantic meaning, any other color doesn't.\n\n\n| Color          | Meaning               | Hex code       |\n| ---            | ---                   | ---            |\n| Bright orange  | Orange wire (on)      | ```#ff8000```  |\n| Dark  orange   | Orange wire (off)     | ```#804000```  |\n| Bright sapphire| Sapphire wire (on)    | ```#0080ff```  |\n| Dark sapphire  | Sapphire wire (off)   | ```#004080```  |\n| Bright lime    | Lime wire (on)        | ```#80ff00```  |\n| Dark lime      | Lime wire (off)       | ```#408000```  |\n| Bright purple  | Output (node to wire) | ```#8000ff```  |\n| Dark purple    | Input (wire to node)  | ```#400080```  |\n| Bright teal    | XOR logic node        | ```#00ff80```  |\n| Dark teal      | AND logic node        | ```#008040```  |\n\nFor backwards compatibility with new functionality, we reserve a total of 48 colors. (This is by convention and is not enforced by the Reso simulator.)\n\n*A brief description of how programs run:* **Wires** push their signals through **input nodes**. There are three different colors of wire (orange, sapphire, and lime). Input nodes pass these signals to **logic nodes** and **output nodes**. Logic nodes are used to calculate the 'AND' or 'XOR' of every input signal, and push these on to **output nodes**. The output nodes act as one big *OR* gate, pushing the new signals out to wires.\n\nThe colors of different wires don't have any significance. They exist to make it easier to wire in 2D space, and to make it easier to keep track of which wire is which.\n\nHere's the full palette of colors that we consider \"reserved\". Other colors are 'whitespace', i.e. will not have any semantic significance.\n\n| Hue               | Saturated (1) | Dark (2)      | Light (3)     | Unsaturated (4) |\n| ---               | ---           | ---           | ---           | ---           |\n| **Red (R)**       | ```#ff0000``` | ```#800000``` | ```#ff8080``` | ```#804040``` |\n| **Yellow (Y)**    | ```#ffff00``` | ```#808000``` | ```#ffff80``` | ```#808040``` |\n| **Green (G)**     | ```#00ff00``` | ```#008000``` | ```#80ff80``` | ```#408040``` |\n| **Cyan (C)**      | ```#00ffff``` | ```#008080``` | ```#80ffff``` | ```#408080``` |\n| **Blue (B)**      | ```#0000ff``` | ```#000080``` | ```#8080ff``` | ```#404080``` |\n| **Magenta (M)**   | ```#ff00ff``` | ```#800080``` | ```#ff80ff``` | ```#804080``` |\n| **Orange (O)**    | ```#ff8000``` | ```#804000``` | ```#ffc080``` | ```#806040``` |\n| **Lime (L)**      | ```#80ff00``` | ```#408000``` | ```#c0ff80``` | ```#608040``` |\n| **Teal (T)**      | ```#00ff80``` | ```#008040``` | ```#80ffc0``` | ```#408060``` |\n| **Sapphire (S)**  | ```#0080ff``` | ```#004080``` | ```#80c0ff``` | ```#406080``` |\n| **Purple (P)**    | ```#8000ff``` | ```#400080``` | ```#c080ff``` | ```#604080``` |\n| **Violet (V)**    | ```#ff0080``` | ```#800040``` | ```#ff80c0``` | ```#804060``` |\n\n(Note: Don't sample directly from your web-browser! They don't always render colors reliably.)\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThe Reso logo is actually a complete circuit in-and-of itself! Here is a small gif that explains what's going on, animated at 1/4th the speed (that is, one update every 2000ms):\n\n![This is Reso gif](./docs/logo/reso_logo_explained.gif)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe Reso Python reference \n\n - [ ] **Restructure:** Restructure this and throw it on Pip so people can install it easily.\n    - [ ] Oh, and throw it on pip.\n    - [ ] Oh also Conda\n - [ ] **Examples:** The more example circuits and components, the better!\n - [ ] **Community:** This blew up! Building a community outside of GitHub issues is hard work. At the minimum, I want to make a Matrix / Discord community for this. \n - [ ] **Reso spec:** We have an incomplete formal spec (with pretty pictures informal spec) sitting around somewhere. Going to try and get that up soon!\n - [ ] Minor things:\n    - [ ] Add a flag to map nearby colors, throwing away a few bits of precision.\n    - [ ] Export-to-gif option.\n    - [ ] Native format for the compiled graph.\n - [ ] Major things:\n    - [ ] Interactive GUI. Perhaps use this [Rust implementation](https://github.com/ashirviskas/rust_reso/) as a WebAssembly backend for a web interface?\n    - [ ] Make a GitHub organization for Reso, to combine specs and implementations under one banner.\n\n\n## See Also\n\nHere are a list of similar projects that I am aware of.
