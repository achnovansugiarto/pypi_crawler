Follow the script below:\n\n```python\nfrom open_feature import open_feature_api\nfrom open_feature.provider.no_op_provider import NoOpProvider\n\nopen_feature_api.set_provider(NoOpProvider())\nopen_feature_client = open_feature_api.get_client()\n```\n\n## Contacting us\n\nWe hold regular meetings which you can see [here](https://github.com/open-feature/community/#meetings-and-events).\n\nWe are also present on the `#openfeature` channel in the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks so much to our contributors.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=open-feature/python-sdk\" />\n</a>\n\nMade with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).\n\n### Development\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please see our [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation!\n",
