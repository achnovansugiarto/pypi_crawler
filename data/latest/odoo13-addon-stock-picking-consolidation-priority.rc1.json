This should make a \"started\" order a priority\nfor all.\n\nThis module adds an option \"Raise priority when partially available\" on\noperation types.\n\nWhen the option is set on an operation type, the first time a packing operation\nis made partially available (goods have been moved for instance from a picking),\nall the other moves that will bring goods for the same packing transfer have\ntheir priority raised to \"Very Urgent\". If the moves that bring goods to the\npacking transfer involves a chain of several moves, all the moves of the chain\nhave their priority raised.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* The priority is hardcoded to \"Very Urgent\", it could be made configurable.\n  That being said, it's easy enough to override ``_consolidate_priority_value``\n  to customize the level.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_picking_consolidation_priority%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/13.0/stock_picking_consolidation_priority>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
