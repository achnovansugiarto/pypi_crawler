Uploaded to\n\t2. Distributed from \n\n\tand \n\n\t3. Documented on\n\t\nthe Python Package Index (aka pypi or the cheeseshop) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi. \nThis project uses setuptools, sphinx, and the Sphinx-PyPI-upload\n(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-upload/0.2.1). \n\nThis demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a \nrecording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and \nhopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.  To be sure, \nthis is simply just *one* way to make a project, document it, and get it \non pypi. \n\nNOTE: This was originally given as a talk to the Minnesota Python Users Group \nhttp://groups.google.com/group/pymntos/ and was developed for a \nspoken presentation format.",
