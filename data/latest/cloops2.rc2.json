From loop-calling based on assumption-free clustering to a full suite of analysis tools for 3D genomic interaction data, cLoops2 has been adapted specifically for data such as Hi-TrAC/Trac-looping, for which interactions are enriched over the genome through experimental steps. cLoops2 still supports Hi-C -like data, of which the interaction signals are evenly distributed at enzyme cutting sites.  The changes from cLoops to cLoops2 are designed to address challenges around aiming for higher resolutions with the next-generation of genome architecture mapping technologies. \n\ncLoops2 is designed with respect reference to [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) for command-line style programming. If you have experience with them, you will find cLoops2 easy and efficient to use and combine commands, integrate as steps in your processing pipeline. \n\nPlease refer to our [Hi-TrAC method manuscript]() or [cLoops2 manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453068v1) for what cLoops2 can do and show. \n\nIf you use cLoops2 in your research (the idea, the algorithm, the analysis scripts or the supplemental data), please give us a star on the GitHub repo page and cite our paper as follows:    \n\nPreprint bioRxiv: [Yaqiang Cao et al. \"cLoops2: a full-stack comprehensive analytical tool for chromatin interactions\"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453068v1)\n\n\n-------\n-------\n## Install\n#### 1. Easy way through pip for stable version\nPython3 is requried.  \n```\npip install cLoops2\n```\n\n-------\n#### 2. Install from source with test data for latest version\ncLoops2 is written purely in Python3 (cLoops was written in Python2). If you are familiar with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), cLoops2 can be installed easily with the following Linux shell commands (also tested well in win10 ubuntu subsystem, MacOS). \n```\n# for most updated code, or download the release version \ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops2\ncd cLoops2\nconda env create --name cLoops2 --file cLoops2_env.yaml\nconda activate cLoops2 \npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\nNecessary Python3 third-party packages are listed below, all of which can be installed through conda. If you like to install cLoops2 through the old school way ***python setup.py install***, please install the 3rd dependencies first. \n```\ntqdm\nnumpy \nscipy \npandas\nsklearn\nseaborn\npyBigWig\nmatplotlib\njoblib\nnetworkx\n```\n\nAfter installation, whenever you want to run cLoops2, just activate the environment with conda: **conda activate cLoops2**. \nHappy peak/loop-calling and have fun exploring all the other kinds of analyses.     \n\n\n------\n------\n## cLoops2 Main Functions\nRun ***cLoops2*** or ***cLoops2 -h*** can show the main functions

Gmm is based on the assumption that PETs \ncan be classified into self-ligation (peaks) and inter-ligation (loops). K-dis\nis based on the k-nearest neighbors distance distribution to find the \"knee\", \nwhich is where the distance (eps) between neighbors has a sharp increase along\nthe k-distance curve. K-dis is the traditional approach literatures, but it is\nmuch more time consuming than gmm, and maybe only fit to small cases. If both \nmethods do not give nice plots, please turn to the empirical parameters you \nlike, such as 100,200 for ChIP-seq -like data, 5000,1000 for Hi-C and etc.\n\nExamples: \n    1. estimate eps with Gaussian mixture model    \n        cLoops2 estEps -d trac -o trac_estEps_gmm -p 10 -method gmm\n\n    2. estimate eps with k-nearest neighbors distance distribution\n        cLoops2 estEps -d trac -o trac_estEps_kdis -p 10 -method k-dis -k 5\n\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n  -d PREDIR            Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. \n  -o FNOUT             Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.\n  -p CPU               CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs\n                       available.

Estimate reasonable contact matrix resolution \nRun **cLoops2 estRes -h** to see details. \n```\nEstimate reasonable genome-wide contact matrix resolution based on signal \nenrichment. \n\nPETs will be assigned to contact matrix bins according to input resolution. A \nbin is marked as [nx,ny], and a PET is assigned to a bin by nx = int((x-s)/bs),\nny = int((y-s)/bs), where s is the minimal coordinate for all PETs and bs is \nthe bin size. Self-interaction bins (nx=ny) will be ignored. The bins only \ncontaining singleton PETs are assumed as noise. \n\nThe output is a PDF plot, for each resolution, a line is separated into two \nparts: 1) dash line indicated linear increased trend of singleton PETs/bins; 2)\nsolid thicker line indicated non-linear increased trend of higher potential \nsignal PETs/bins. The higher the ratio of signal PETs/bins, the easier it it to\nfind loops in that resolution.

Call differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops\nRun **cLoops2 callDiffLoops -h** to see details.\n```\nCall differentially enriched intra-chromosomal loops between two conditions.\n\nSimilar to calling peaks with control data, calling differentially enriched \nloops is based on scaled PETs and the Poisson test. There are three main steps \nin the algorithm: 1) merge the overlapped loops, quantify them and their \npermutated local background regions; 2) fit the linear transformation of \nbackground target interaction density to control background data based on \nMANorm2; therefore, if there are more than than two samples, others can be \nscaled to the reference sample for quantitative comparison; 3) estimate the \nfold change (M) cutoff and average (A) cutoff using the background data with \nthe control of FDR, assuming there should no differentially significant \ninteractions called from the background data; or using the assigned cutoffs; 4) \nestimate the significance based on the Poisson test for transformed data, both \nfor the loop and loop anchors. For example, if transformed PETs for target is \n5, PETs for control is 3 while control nearby permutated background median is \n4, then for the Poisson test, lambda=4-1 is used to test the observed 5 to call\np-value.\n\nExample:\n    1. classical usage \n        cLoops2 callDiffLoops -tloop target_loop.txt -cloop control_loop.txt \\\n                          -td ./target -cd ./control -o target_diff\n\n    2. customize MA cutoffs \n        cLoops2 callDiffLoops -tloop target_loop.txt -cloop control_loop.txt \\\n                          -td ./target -cd ./control -o target_diff -cutomize \\\n                          -acut 5 -mcut 0.5\n\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -d PREDIR             Assign data directory generated by cLoops2 pre to carry out analysis. \n  -o FNOUT              Output data directory / file name prefix, default is cLoops2_output.\n  -p CPU                CPUs used to run the job, default is 1, set -1 to use all CPUs\n                        available.

Output is a .pdf file \ncontaining a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the data. The \ndata in the .txt file and plot were normalized to RPM (reads per million).\n\nFor the aggregated view points analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with \ncoordinates for the target regions/peaks/anchors as view point. Output is a \n.pdf file containing a mean density plot and heatmap and a .txt file for the \ndata. The data in the .txt file and plot were normalized to \nlog2( RPM (reads per million)+1).\n\nFor the aggregated loops analysis, input is a _loops.txt file annotated with \nthe coordinates for target loops, similar to the format of BEDPE. Output is a \n.pdf file for mean heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all \nloops and nearby regions matrix. The enrichment score (ES) in the plot is \ncalculated as: ES = mean( (PETs in loop)/(mean PETs of nearby regions) ). Other \nfiles except _loops.txt can be used as input, as long as the file contains key \ninformation in the first columns separated by tabs:\nloopId\tchrA\tstartA\tendA\tchrB\tstartB\tendB\tdistance\nloop-1\tchr21\t1000\t2000\tchr21\t8000\t9000\t7000\n\nThere is another option for loops analysis, termed as two anchors. Input file is \nsame to aggregated loops analysis. The whole region with assigned extesion\nbetween two anchors will be aggregated and 1D profile can show two anchors. The \nanalysis could be usefule to study/comapre different classes of anchors and \ncombinations, for example, considering CTCT motif directions, all left anchors\nCTCF motifs are in positive strand and in negative strand for all right anchors. \nIt could be interesting for some loops one anchor only bound by transcription \nfactor a and another anchor only bound by transcription b. \n\nFor the aggregated domains analysis, input is a .bed file annotated with the\ncoordinates for the domains, such as TADs. Output are a .pdf file for the upper \ntriangular heatmap and .npz file generated through numpy.savez for all domains \nand nearby region matrix.
