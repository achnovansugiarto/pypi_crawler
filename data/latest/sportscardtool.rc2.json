We hope to build the modern dynamic checklist and price book.\r\n\r\nCurrently SportsCardTool provides the ability to gather all baseball card setlists. In the future these setlists will be prescraped, allowing for search and tracking capabilities. We would like to drive price tracking via users which would help dectralize some of the larger data collection.\r\n\r\n## Install it from PyPI\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install SportsCardTool\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nScraping a year of data:\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\n\r\nfrom SportsCardTool import grab_card_list, dump_data, grab_year_links\r\n\r\n# Find All Cards for 2023 Season, returned as list of dictionaries\r\nyear_links = grab_year_links([\"2023\"])\r\ncard_list = grab_card_list(year_link)\r\n\r\n# Create CSV to allow for manipulation via pandas\r\ndump_data(mock_data, \"2023_cards.csv\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nGrabbing cards from scraped data\r\n\r\n```py\r\n\r\nfrom SportsCardTool import QueryBuilder\r\n\r\nqb = QueryBuilder()\r\n\r\n# Construct query requesting Barry Bonds cards from 2000 with an autograph and a print run of 25 or 250\r\nqb.add_item({\"name\": \"Barry Bonds\", \"year\": \"2000\", \"auto\": \"True\", \"serial\": \"25,250\"})\r\n\r\n# Make request and return in form of tuple (list[dict], int)\r\ndata = qb.grab_data()\r\n\r\nprint(data[0])\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"641f49185ee984b20a66ef77\",\r\n      \"auto\": true,\r\n      \"back_img\": null,\r\n      \"front_img\": null,\r\n      \"group\": \"fleer-ultra\",\r\n      \"listing\": \"2000 Fleer Ultra Fresh Ink #11 Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"mem\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"number\": \"11\",\r\n      \"price\": 0,\r\n      \"rc\": false,\r\n      \"serial\": 250,\r\n      \"set\": \"fleer-ultra-fresh-ink-baseball-trading-card-checklist\",\r\n      \"team\": \"San Francisco Giants\",\r\n      \"year\": 2000\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"641f49185ee984b20a66f5f4\",\r\n      \"auto\": true,\r\n      \"back_img\": null,\r\n      \"front_img\": null,\r\n      \"group\": \"fleer-ultra\",\r\n      \"listing\": \"2000 Fleer Ultra Fresh Ink #11 Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"mem\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"number\": \"11\",\r\n      \"price\": 0,\r\n      \"rc\": false,\r\n      \"serial\": 250,\r\n      \"set\": \"fleer-ultra-fresh-ink-baseball-trading-card-checklist\",\r\n      \"team\": \"San Francisco Giants\",\r\n      \"year\": 2000\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"641f49185ee984b20a674b2f\",\r\n      \"auto\": true,\r\n      \"back_img\": null,\r\n      \"front_img\": null,\r\n      \"group\": \"upper-deck\",\r\n      \"listing\": \"2000 Upper Deck  Game Jersey Autograph Numbered #BB Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"mem\": true,\r\n      \"name\": \"Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"number\": \"BB\",\r\n      \"price\": 0,\r\n      \"rc\": false,\r\n      \"serial\": 25,\r\n      \"set\": \"upper-deck-game-jersey-autograph-numbered-baseball-trading-card-checklist\",\r\n      \"team\": \"San Francisco Giants\",\r\n      \"year\": 2000\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"641f49185ee984b20a678e31\",\r\n      \"auto\": true,\r\n      \"back_img\": null,\r\n      \"front_img\": null,\r\n      \"group\": \"upper-deck-pros-and-prospects\",\r\n      \"listing\": \"2000 Upper Deck Pros and Prospects Game Jersey Autograph Gold #BB Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"mem\": true,\r\n      \"name\": \"Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"number\": \"BB\",\r\n      \"price\": 0,\r\n      \"rc\": false,\r\n      \"serial\": 25,\r\n      \"set\": \"upper-deck-pros-and-prospects-game-jersey-autograph-gold-baseball-trading-card-checklist\",\r\n      \"team\": \"San Francisco Giants\",\r\n      \"year\": 2000\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"641f49185ee984b20a67958c\",\r\n      \"auto\": true,\r\n      \"back_img\": null,\r\n      \"front_img\": null,\r\n      \"group\": \"sp-authentic\",\r\n      \"listing\": \"2000 SP Authentic Chirography Gold #GBB Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"mem\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"Barry Bonds\",\r\n      \"number\": \"GBB\",\r\n      \"price\": 0,\r\n      \"rc\": false,\r\n      \"serial\": 25,\r\n      \"set\": \"sp-authentic-chirography-gold-baseball-trading-card-checklist\",\r\n      \"team\": \"San Francisco Giants\",\r\n      \"year\": 2000\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nRead the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\r\n\r\n### Attribution\r\n\r\nThis README was adapted from an example [here](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/blob/main/README.md)\r\n",
