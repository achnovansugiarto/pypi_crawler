    "description": "====================\nSimple Remote Python\n====================\n:Info: See `the Simple Remote Python site <http://code.google.com/p/srpy/>`_ for more information.\n:Author: Ricardo Henriques <paxcalpt@gmail.com>\n:Copyright: 2009 by Ricardo Henriques\n:License: BSD, see LICENSES folder for more details.\n\nAbout\n=====\n\nSimple Remote Python (SRPy) intends to harness the power of the Python by\nallowing multiple python programs (instances) to seamlessly communicate and\nshare information between each other. As such, each CPU (or core) in each\ncomputer can be considered as an individual that can request for other\nindividuals to store information or run processing tasks. In this context,\nSRPy abstracts itself from the physical boundaries between processors and\ncomputers by looking at them simply as volunteer workers that are able to\ndeal with workloads - this workers can even work in a social manner by\ncommunicating with each other on a non-centralized way, sharing information\nand processing requests.\nIt features:\n\n    * Remote control of python instances (through Python or Jython)\n    * Parallel execution of python code on SMP and clusters\n    * Low overhead\n    * Pure python code\n    * Cross-platform portability and interoperability (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X)\n    * Cross-architecture portability and interoperability (x86, x86-64, etc.)\n    * Open source\n\n**Note**: Although Jython SRPy clients are supported, the server will not run\nunder Jython. This is a limitation inherited by the Pyro dependency that will\nbe fixed soon.\n\nInstallation\n============\nIf you have `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_\ninstalled you should be able to do **easy_install srpy** to install SRPy.\nOtherwise you can download the project source and do **python setup.py install**\nto install. SRPy also works directly from source, just copy the folder srpy to\nyour favorite location and import it. To start the server do:\n**python path/to/srpyapp.py**\n\nDependencies\n============\nThe SRPy distribution depends on the `Pyro <http://pyro.sourceforge.net/>`_ library, it is bundled inside SRPy.\nIt has been tested on Python 2.5 and 2.6.\n\nAcknowledgments\n===============\n\nSRPy comes bundled with `Pyro <http://pyro.sourceforge.net/>`_, most of its\nfeatures come from interfacing with the Pyro library.\n\nSRPy is not the only software of the genre, many other great libraries that\nprovide similar features are available:\n\n    * `Pyro <http://pyro.sourceforge.net/>`_\n    * `Parallel-Python <http://www.parallelpython.com>`_\n    * `RPyC <http://rpyc.wikidot.com/>`_\n    * `papyros <http://code.google.com/p/papyros/>`_\n    * `SPIRO <http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/spiro/>`_\n    \nMany of the ideas inside SRPy have come from this packages, we don't intend\nto be the best, just a different flavor that concentrates in bringing:\n\n    * easy of use\n    * compatibility with the great features brought from `Pyro <http://pyro.sourceforge.net/>`_\n    * both Python and Jython compatibility\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nDocumentation can be found on the *doc/* directory. Also do\n**python path/to/srpyapp.py --help** to see the server options.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n    * 0.2.2\n        * Fixed Pyro import bug\n    \n    * 0.2.1\n        * Fixed bug that didn't allow multi-server start on Windows\n\n    * 0.2.0\n        * No longer depends on Parallel-Python\n        * Documentation greatly improved and is now included\n        * EngBox now acts as a container\n        * EngBox able to benchmark remote Python Engines\n        * Improved thread safety\n        * Code cleanup\n        * srpyapp.py can now use a Pyro configuration file\n\n    * 0.1.2\n        * Fixed several errors\n        * Added EngBox class to srpyclient to help manage multiple PythonEngines\n\n    * 0.1.1\n        * Fixed a Pyro import error: Successfully imports bundled Pyro if available\n        * srpy and srpy-bundled are now a unified package",
