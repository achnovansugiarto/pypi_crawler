    "description": "[![HLink Docker CI](https://github.com/ipums/hlink/actions/workflows/docker-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ipums/hlink/actions/workflows/docker-build.yml)\n\n# hlink: hierarchical record linkage at scale\n\nhlink is a Python package that provides a flexible, configuration-driven solution to probabilistic record linking at scale. It provides a high-level API for python as well as a standalone command line interface for running linking jobs with little to no programming. hlink supports the linking process from beginning to end, including preprocessing, filtering, training, model exploration, blocking, feature generation and scoring.\n\nIt is used at [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/) to link U.S. historical census data, but can be applied to any record linkage job. \nA paper on the creation and applications of this program on historical census data can be found at <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01615440.2021.1985027>.\n\n## Installation\n\nhlink runs on Python 3.10.\nJava 8 or [Java 11](https://openjdk.org/install/) is required for the PySpark integration. \n\nYou can install the python package from pip:\n```\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install hlink\n```\n\n## Docs\n\nThe documentation site can be found at [hlink.docs.ipums.org](https://hlink.docs.ipums.org).\nThis includes information about installation and setting up your configuration files.\n\nAn example script and configuration file can be found in the `examples` directory.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe main class in the library is LinkRun, which represents a complete linking job. It provides access to each of the link tasks and their steps. Here is an example script that uses LinkRun to do some linking.\n\n```python\nfrom hlink.linking.link_run import LinkRun\nfrom hlink.spark.factory import SparkFactory\nfrom hlink.configs.load_config import load_conf_file\n\n# First we create a SparkSession with all default configuration settings.\nfactory = SparkFactory()\nspark = factory.create()\n\n# Now let's load in our config file. See the example config below.\n# This config file is in toml format, but we also allow json format.\n# Alternatively you can create a python dictionary directly with the same\n# keys and values as is in the config.\nconfig = load_conf_file(\"./my_conf.toml\")\n\nlr = LinkRun(spark, config)\n\n# Get some information about each of the steps in the\n# preprocessing task.\nprep_steps = lr.preprocessing.get_steps()\nfor (i, step) in enumerate(prep_steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i}:\", step)\n    print(\"Required input tables:\", step.input_table_names)\n    print(\"Generated output tables:\", step.output_table_names)\n\n# Run all of the steps in the preprocessing task.\nlr.preprocessing.run_all_steps()\n\n# Run the first two steps in the matching task.\nlr.matching.run_step(0)\nlr.matching.run_step(1)\n\n# Get the potential_matches table.\nmatches = lr.get_table(\"potential_matches\")\n\nassert matches.exists()\n\n# Get the Spark DataFrame for the potential_matches table.\nmatches_df = matches.df()\n```\n\nAn example configuration file:\n\n```toml\n### hlink config file ###\n# This is a sample config file for the hlink program in toml format.\n\n# The name of the unique identifier in the datasets\nid_column = \"id\" \n\n### INPUT ###\n\n# The input datasets\n[datasource_a]\nalias = \"a\"\nfile = \"data/A.csv\"\n\n[datasource_b]\nalias = \"b\"\nfile = \"data/B.csv\"\n\n### PREPROCESSING ###\n\n# The columns to extract from the sources and the preprocessing to be done on them.\n[[column_mappings]]\ncolumn_name = \"NAMEFRST\"\ntransforms = [\n    {type = \"lowercase_strip\"}\n]\n\n[[column_mappings]]\ncolumn_name = \"NAMELAST\"\ntransforms = [\n    {type = \"lowercase_strip\"}\n]\n\n[[column_mappings]]\ncolumn_name = \"AGE\"\ntransforms = [\n    {type = \"add_to_a\", value = 10}\n]\n\n[[column_mappings]]\ncolumn_name = \"SEX\"\n\n\n### BLOCKING ###\n\n# Blocking parameters\n# Here we are blocking on sex and +/- age. \n# This means that no comparisons will be done on records\n# where the SEX fields don't match exactly and the AGE \n# fields are not within a distance of 2.\n[[blocking]]\ncolumn_name = \"SEX\"\n\n[[blocking]]\ncolumn_name = \"AGE_2\"\ndataset = \"a\"\nderived_from = \"AGE\"\nexpand_length = 2\nexplode = true\n\n### COMPARISON FEATURES ###\n\n# Here we detail the comparison features that are\n# created between the two records. In this case\n# we are comparing first and last names using \n# the jaro-winkler metric.\n\n[[comparison_features]]\nalias = \"NAMEFRST_JW\"\ncolumn_name = \"NAMEFRST\"\ncomparison_type = \"jaro_winkler\"\n\n[[comparison_features]]\nalias = \"NAMELAST_JW\"\ncolumn_name = \"NAMELAST\"\ncomparison_type = \"jaro_winkler\"\n\n# Here we detail the thresholds at which we would\n# like to keep potential matches.

Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4.
