If you want to update the attribute's value, just set the `read_only` of the `AttrMap` instance as `False` via `au.convert_state(obj, read_only=False)`.\n\nIf the `AttrMap` object should be unmodifiable, setting the object as **read-only** is recommended.\n\nYou can also build an `AttrMap` instance from a `.json` or `.yaml` file. For example, assume you have a `file.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"language\": [\"python\", \"cpp\", \"java\"], \n    \"value\": [[\"one\", \"two\"]], \n    \"structure\":{\n        \"tree\":[\"left tree\", \"right tree\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can build `AttrMap` object via:\n\n```python\nfrom attrmap import AttrMap\n\nconfigs = AttrMap(path2file=\"/PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY/file.json\") # .yaml file works too.\nprint(configs)\n# Object Contains Following Attributes\n#  language: ['python', 'cpp', 'java']\n#  value: [['one', 'two']]\n#  structure:\n#          tree: ['left tree', 'right tree']\n```\n\n**NOTE:** The `read-only` protection should be explicitly enabled, `AttrMap` assumes you are still setting the attributes and their values.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Attributes start with `_` might be conflict with `AttrMap` perserved methods/properties. Attributes can still be accessed via dict-style (`[\"\"]`), but the attribute-style\nwill return the \"protected\" (not the term of python, only means it's not \"public\") method such as `_build_from_dict`.\n- Some public available properties and methods are reserved, they can only accessed via the dict-style.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nOpen bash shell and execute:\n\n```bash\nbash -i ./auto_test.sh\n```\n\n## APIs\n\nSee [The API Reference](https://attrmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html)\n\n## TODO\n\n## LICENSE\n\n`AttrMap` is an open source tool under Apache 2.0 license.\n\nCopyright 2022 Yiqun Chen.
