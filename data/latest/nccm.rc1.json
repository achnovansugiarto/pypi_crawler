You must include this entire text with your\ndistribution.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\nuseful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied\nwarranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n\nManual install instructions\n---------------------------\n\nCopy the script to a directory of your choice and prepare\nthe ssh connections yml file in one of the supported\ndirectories.\n\nYou may need to manually install the PyYAML module:\n  `pip3 install --user PyYAML`\n\nYou may even need to install the python pip3 program if\nyour distro doesn't have it.\n\nYou can do the following:\n```\n  copy the nccm.py script to: /usr/local/bin/\n  cd /usr/local/bin/\n  chmod 755 nccm.py\n  chown root:root nccm.py\n```\n\nThe script can then be run by simply typing `nccm.py`\nfrom anywhere.\n\nThe ssh connections (servers) file is loaded from the\nfollowing paths, whichever is found first:\n```\n  ~/.config/nccm/nccm.yml\n  ~/.nccm.yml\n  ~/nccm.yml\n  /etc/nccm.yml\n```\n\nThis program comes with an example yml file. Edit it\nso suit your needs.\n\n\nControls\n--------\n\n```\nUp/Down arrows      Scroll the list up/down\nHome/End            Jump to list first/last entry\nPgUp/PgDn           Page up/down in the list\nShift Up/Down       Move the marker up/down\nShift Left/Right    Move the marker to display top/bottom\nEnter               Connect to the selected entry\n\nCtrl-h              Display this help menu\nCtrl-q or Ctrl-c    Quit the program\nF1-F4 or !@#$       Sort by respective column (1-4)\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n'Conn #' textbox:\nAccepts integer values only (and !@#$ for sorting).\nPressing Enter here will connect to this connection ID,\n(provided it is a valid connection number in the full\n(unfiltered) connections list), ignoring everything else:\nFilter textbox, highlighted line - even if they don't\nmatch. If this textbox is empty, it will connect to the\nconnection marked by the highlighted line.\n\n'Filter:' textbox:\nType any filter text here.\nAccepts any printable character and space.\nText is forced to lowercase, and the resulting filtering\nis case insensitive.\nPressing Enter will connect to the connection highlighed\nin red. This also works if you're in the Conn textbox\nand it's empty.\n\nTextboxes accept backspace to delete one char backwards,\ninline editing not supported.\n\nDisplayed connection list is filtered by the combined\ncontents of all the fields as you type in real time.\nSpaces delimit filters if typed into 'Filter:' textbox\nand all filter entries are AND'ed.\n\nRegular direction keys (arrow up/down, home, end, pgup,\npgdn) scroll the list vertically.\nArrow left/right scroll the list horizontally if the text\nis longer than the width of your window.\nShift arrow up/down scrolls the marker up/down within the\nconfines of your display. Shift arrow left/right jumps\nthe marker to the first/last visible line in your display.\nThe reason for doing it this way is that independant\nlist and marker movement usually achieves faster results\nwith less keypresses.\n\n\nSorting\n-------\n\nF1-F4 keys sort by the respective fields 1-4.\nThe Fn keys may be captured by certain GUIs so we have\nan alternative - when focused on 'Conn #' window, press\nshift-1 through 4 (!@#$) to toggle sorting by the\nrespective field number.\nPressing the same key again reverses the sort order.\n\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nLots...\n\nWill not store passwords. Please don't request this\nfeature because it won't be added.\nEither use ssh passwordless login (by placing your\npublic key on the server in .ssh/authorized_keys - tip:\nlook up ssh-copy-id) or store your password in a\npassword manager and paste it when prompted.\n\nDoes not like window resizing and display will do\nstrange things. Upsizing the window usually messes\nup the screen, while downsizing the window throws\nan exception.\nIf things go wrong, and you're still stuck in the window,\nexit with ctrl-q or ctrl-c and run it again.\nIt's safe to resize the window once connection\nestablishment is in progress or after connected to\nyour server.\n\nDoes not support highlighting filter keywords in search\nresults because this results in a messy and confusing\ndisplay once more than a couple keywords are used.\n\nText entry is limited to the length of the textboxes\nwhich in turn are dictated by the width of your window.\nThis should be enough for most use cases though.\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\nThis program aims to do one thing well - let you make SSH\nconnections from an ncurses based manager with minimum\ndistraction. I wish to avoid feature creep to keep it\non focus.\n\nThe code is heavily commented, with the hope that it will\nmake life easier for modders and forkers.\n\n\n",
