    "description": ".. image:: https://travis-ci.org/ashleysommer/stdeb3.png?branch=master\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/ashleysommer/stdeb3\n\nstdeb3 - Python to Debian source package conversion utility\n===========================================================\n\nThis is a port of `stdeb <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb>`_ with\nmodernisations such as removal of python2 support at build-time,\nremoval of support for Debian versions less than 8 (jessie) (oldstable),\nbump of minimum required Debhelper version, newer dh-compat version,\nand lots more. See the RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more info.\n\n`stdeb3 <http://github.com/ashleysommer/stdeb3>`_ produces Debian source\npackages from Python packages via a new distutils command,\n``sdist_dsc``. Automatic defaults are provided for the Debian package,\nbut many aspects of the resulting package can be customized (see the\ncustomizing section, below). An additional command, ``bdist_deb``,\ncreates a Debian binary package, a .deb file. The ``install_deb``\ncommand installs this .deb file. The ``debianize`` command builds a\n``debian/`` directory directly alongside your setup.py.\n\nSeveral convenience utilities are also provided:\n\n* ``pypi-download`` will query the `Python Package Index (PyPI)\n  <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ for a package and download it.\n* ``pypi-install`` will query the `Python Package Index (PyPI)\n  <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ for a package, download it, create a\n  .deb from it, and then install the .deb.\n* ``py2dsc`` will convert a distutils-built source tarball into a\n  Debian source package.\n* ``py2dsc-deb`` will convert a distutils-built source tarball into a\n  Debian source package and then use the Debian machinery to build a\n  .deb file from this.\n\n.. contents::\n\n\nPython 3 support\n----------------\n\nAs explained in more detail below, the heart of stdeb is the sdist_dsc\ndistutils command. This command runs once to generate a Debian source\npackage. This Debian source package can specify building packages for\nPython 2, Python 3, or both. This can now only per performed by the\npython3 interpreter. By default, only packages\nare built for the version of Python being used. To override this, use\n``--with-python2=True`` or ``--with-python3=True`` as an argument to\nthe sdist_dsc distutils command (or use both to be sure). For example,\nto build only a Python 3 package using the Python 3 interpreter::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command bdist_deb\n\nTo build both Python 2 and Python 3 packages using the Python 3\ninterpreter (and only the Python3 package installs scripts)::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command sdist_dsc --with-python2=True --with-python3=True --no-python2-scripts=True bdist_deb\n\nNews\n----\n * 2019-01-31: **Version 0.9.0**.\n   Ported to stdeb3. See RELEASE_NOTES.txt for changes.\n\n * 2015-02-18: **Version 0.8.5**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.5>`__. Bugfixes: reverted\n   change that installed into virtualenv when built in\n   virtualenv. Improvements: Added\n   `--allow-virtualenv-install-location` to allow installing into\n   virtualenv location. Supports Debian Squeeze (6), Debian Wheezy\n   (7), Ubuntu Precise (12.04), Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) and later\n   releases.\n\n * 2015-02-16: **Version 0.8.4**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.4>`__. Bugfixes: works on\n   Python 3.4 (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty) again. Improvements: Improved\n   customization for Python 3 (Dirk Thomas added\n   `force-x-python3-version` and `X-Python3-Version` and Louis for\n   `Recommends3`, `Suggests3`, `Provides3` and `Replaces3`\n   support. Supports Debian Squeeze (6), Debian Wheezy (7), Ubuntu\n   Precise (12.04), Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) and later releases.\n\n * 2015-02-14: **Version 0.8.3**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.3>`__. This is a bugfix\n   release which fixes several aspects of Unicode support. Tests pass\n   on Debian Squeeze (6), Debian Wheezy (7), and Ubuntu Precise\n   (12.04). Support for Python 3.4 (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty 14.04) was\n   mistakenly broken and was fixed in the 0.8.3 release.\n\n * 2014-8-14: **Version 0.8.2**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.2>`__. This is a bugfix\n   release fixing a serious issue that would cause a Python 2 package\n   to be built if only a Python 3 package was requested in some\n   circumstances.\n\n * 2014-8-10: **Version 0.8.1**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.1>`__. Due\n   to bugs in 0.8.0, this release is the first announced from the 0.8\n   series. Highlights since 0.7.1:\n\n   - Full support for Python 3. This includes being run from Python 3\n     and generating packages for Python 3. The default is to build\n     Python 3 packages when run with Python 3 and to build Python 2\n     packages when run from Python 2. Command line options can be used\n     to build packages for the other Python interpreter, too.\n\n   - Build .changes file for source package. While this still must be\n     signed for upload to a PPA, for example, it should still be\n     useful in some cases.\n\n   - Switch to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt). Practically speaking,\n     the .diff.gz file that used to come with a source package is now\n     replaced by a .debian.tar.gz file.\n\n   - Verify SSL certificates when talking to PyPI using\n     Requests. (Verification requires Requests >= 0.8.8.)\n\n   - Many bugfixes.\n\n * 2014-05-05: **Version 0.7.1**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.7.1>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.7.1/CHANGELOG.txt>`__). Due\n   to bugs in 0.7.0, this release is the first announced from the 0.7\n   series. Highlights since 0.6.0:\n\n   - New commands: pypi-download and pypi-install to directly download\n     and install packages from PyPI, respectively. py2dsc-deb directly\n     creates a .deb file from a source tarball.\n\n   - New distutils command: install_deb lets you directly install a\n     python package as a standard system package.\n\n   - Many bugfixes, including the new URL for PyPI.\n\n   - Automated runs of test suite, thanks to Travis CI\n\n   - Thanks to many, especially Piotr Ożarowski for help with stdeb.\n\n * 2010-06-18: **Version 0.6.0**. See the `download page\n   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.6.0>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.6.0/CHANGELOG.txt>`__):\n\n   - A new ``debianize`` command to build a ``debian/`` directory\n     alongside your setup.py file.\n\n   - Bugfixes.\n\n * 2010-01-09: **Version 0.5.1**. Bugfix release. See the `download\n   page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.5.1>`__, the `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.1/CHANGELOG.txt>`__\n   and `release notes\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.1/RELEASE_NOTES.txt>`__.\n\n * 2009-12-30: **Version 0.5.0**. See the `download page\n   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.5.0>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.0/CHANGELOG.txt>`__):\n\n   - A new ``pypi-install`` script will automatically download, make a\n     .deb, and install packages from the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_.\n\n   - Removal of the setuptools dependency.\n\n   - New option (`--guess-conflicts-provides-replaces`) to query\n     original Debian packages for Conflicts/Provides/Replaces\n     information.\n\n   - As a result of these changes and to fix a couple bugs/warts, some\n     minor backwards incompatible changes and deprecations were\n     made.

Specifically,\nyou could include this in your ``~/.pydistutils.cfg`` file::\n\n  [global]\n  command-packages: stdeb3.command\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThese all assume you have stde3b installed in your system Python\npath. stdeb3 also works from a non-system Python path (e.g. a\n`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_).\n\nQuickstart 1: Install something from PyPI now, I don't care about anything else\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nDo this from the command line::\n\n  pypi-install mypackage\n\n**Warning: Despite doing its best, there is absolutely no way stdeb\ncan guarantee all the Debian package dependencies will be properly\nfulfilled without manual intervention. Using pypi-install bypasses\nyour ability to customize stdeb's behavior. Read the rest of this\ndocument to understand how to make better packages.**\n\nQuickstart 2: Just tell me the fastest way to make a .deb\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n(First, install stdeb3 as you normally install Python packages.)\n\nDo this from the directory with your `setup.py` file::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command bdist_deb\n\nThis will make a Debian source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz and\n.diff.gz files) and then compile it to a Debian binary package (.deb)\nfor your current system. The result will be in ``deb_dist``.\n\n**Warning: installing the .deb file on other versions of Ubuntu or\nDebian than the one on which it was compiled will result in undefined\nbehavior. If you have extension modules, they will probably\nbreak. Even in the absence of extension modules, bad stuff will likely\nhappen.**\n\nFor this reason, it is much better to build the Debian source package\nand then compile that (e.g. using `Ubuntu's PPA`__) for each target\nversion of Debian or Ubuntu.\n\n__ https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\n\nQuickstart 3: I read the warning, so show me how to make a source package, then compile it\n``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nThis generates a source package::\n\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  py2dsc Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n\nThis turns it into a .deb using the standard Debian tools. (Do *this*\non the same source package for each target distribution)::\n\n  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0/\n  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us\n\nThis installs it::\n\n  cd ..\n  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb\n\nQuickstart 4: Install from a Python package direct to a debian system package\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n(First, install stdeb as you normally install Python packages.)\n\nDo this from the directory with your `setup.py` file::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command install_deb\n\nThis will make a Debian source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz and\n.diff.gz files), compile it to a Debian binary package (.deb) for your\ncurrent system and then install it using ``dpkg``.\n\n\nAnother example, with more explanation\n``````````````````````````````````````\n\nThis example is more useful if you don't have a Python source package\n(.tar.gz file generated by ``python setup.py sdist``). For the sake of\nillustration, we do download such a tarball, but immediately unpack it\n(alternatively, use a version control system to grab the unpacked\nsource of a package)::\n\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  tar xzf Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  cd Reindent-0.1.0\n\nThe following will generate a directory ``deb_dist`` containing the\nfiles ``reindent_0.1.0-1.dsc``, ``reindent_0.1.0.orig.tar.gz`` and\n``reindent_0.1.0-1.diff.gz``, which, together, are a debian source\npackage::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command sdist_dsc\n\nThe source generated in the above way is also extracted (using\n``dpkg-source -x``) and placed in the ``deb_dist`` subdirectory. To\ncontinue the example above::\n\n  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0\n  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us\n\nFinally, the generated package can be installed::\n\n  cd ..\n  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb\n\nFor yet another example of use, with still more explanation, see\n`allmydata-tahoe ticket 251`_.\n\n.. _allmydata-tahoe ticket 251: http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/ticket/251\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nFiles are available at the `download page`_ (for ancient releases, see\nthe `old download page`_).\n\n.. _download page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb\n.. _old download page: http://stdeb.python-hosting.com/wiki/Download\n\nThe git repository is available at\nhttp://github.com/astraw/stdeb\n\nInstall (or, using stdeb to create an stdeb installer)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor a bit of fun, here's how to install stdeb using stdeb. Note that\nstdeb is also in Debian and Ubuntu, so this recipe is only necessary\nto install a more recent stdeb.\n\n::\n\n  STDEB3_VERSION=\"0.9.0\"\n\n  # Download stdeb3\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/stdeb3/stdeb3-$STDEB3_VERSION.tar.gz\n\n  # Extract it\n  tar xzf stdeb3-$STDEB3_VERSION.tar.gz\n\n  # Enter extracted source package\n  cd stdeb3-$STDEB3_VERSION\n\n  # Build .deb (making use of stdeb package directory in sys.path).\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command bdist_deb\n\n  # Install it\n  sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python-stdeb3_$STDEB3_VERSION-1_all.deb\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nFor the average Python package, its source distribution\n(python_package.tar.gz created with ``python3 setup.py sdist``)\ncontains nearly everything necessary to make a Debian source\npackage. This near-equivalence encouraged me to write this distutils\nextension, which executes the setup.py file to extract relevant\ninformation. `setuptools\n<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_ may optionally\nbe used.\n\nI wrote this initially to Debianize several Python packages of my own,\nbut I have the feeling it could be generally useful. It appears\nsimilar, at least in theory, to easydeb_, `Logilab's Devtools`_,\nbdist_dpkg_, bdist_deb_, pkgme_ and `dh-virtualenv\n<https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv>`__.\n\n.. _easydeb: http://easy-deb.sourceforge.net/\n.. _Logilab's DevTools: http://www.logilab.org/projects/devtools\n.. _bdist_dpkg: http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/Lib/bdist_dpkg.py\n.. _bdist_deb: http://bugs.python.org/issue1054967\n.. _pkgme: https://launchpad.net/pkgme\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Create a package for all Python versions supported by\n  python-support. (Limiting this range is possible with the\n  ``XS-Python-Version:`` config option.)\n\n* Automatic conversion of Python package names into valid Debian\n  package names.\n\n* Attempt to automatically convert version numbers such that ordering\n  is maintained. See also the config option\n  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``.\n\n* Fine grained control of version numbers. (``Debian-Version``,\n  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``, ``Upstream-Version-Prefix``,\n  ``Upstream-Version-Suffix`` config options.)\n\n* Install .desktop files. (``MIME-Desktop-Files`` config option.)\n\n* Install .mime and .sharedmimeinfo files. (``MIME-File`` and\n  ``Shared-MIME-File`` config options.)\n\n* Install copyright files. (``Copyright-File`` config option.)\n\n* Apply patches to upstream sources. (``Stdeb-Patch-File`` config\n  option.)\n\n* Pass environment variables to setup.py script. (``Setup-Env-Vars``\n  config option.)\n\nCustomizing the produced Debian source package (config options)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nstdeb will attempt to provide reasonable defaults, but these are only\nguesses.\n\nThere are two ways to customize the Debian source package produced by\nstdeb. First, you may provide options to the distutils\ncommands. Second, you may provide an ``stdeb.cfg`` file.\n\nstdeb distutils command options\n```````````````````````````````\n\nThe sdist_dsc command takes command-line options to the distutils\ncommand. For example::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb3.command sdist_dsc --debian-version 0MyName1\n\nThis creates a Debian package with the Debian version set to\n\"0MyName1\".\n\nThese options can also be set via distutils configuration\nfiles. (These are the ``setup.cfg`` file alongside ``setup.py`` and\nthe ~/.pydistutils.cfg file.) In that case, put the arguments in the\n``[sdist_dsc]`` section. For example, a project's ``~/.setup.cfg``\nfile might have this::\n\n  [sdist_dsc]\n  debian-version: 0MyName1\n\nTo pass these commands to sdist_dsc when calling bdist_deb, do this::\n\n  python3 setup.py sdist_dsc --debian-version 0MyName1 bdist_deb\n\n====================================== =========================================\n        Command line option                      Effect\n====================================== =========================================\n  --with-python2                       build Python 2 package (default=True)\n  --with-python3                       build Python 3 package (default=False)\n  --no-python2-scripts                 disable installation of Python 2 scripts (default=False)\n  --no-python3-scripts                 disable installation of Python 3 scripts (default=False)\n  --force-x-python3-version            Override default minimum python3:any\n                                       dependency with value from x-python3-\n                                       version\n  --allow-virtualenv-install-location  Allow installing into\n                                       /some/random/virtualenv-path\n  --sign-results                       Use gpg to sign the resulting .dsc and\n                                       .changes file\n  --sign-key                           Use this gpg key signature to sign\n  --dist-dir (-d)                      directory to put final built\n                                       distributions in (default='deb_dist')\n  --patch-already-applied (-a)         patch was already applied (used when\n                                       py2dsc calls sdist_dsc)\n  --default-distribution               deprecated (see --suite)\n  --suite (-z)                         distribution name to use if not\n                                       specified in .cfg (default='unstable')\n  --default-maintainer                 deprecated (see --maintainer)\n  --maintainer (-m)                    maintainer name and email to use if not\n                                       specified in .cfg (default from\n                                       setup.py)\n  --extra-cfg-file (-x)                additional .cfg file (in addition to\n                                       stdeb.cfg if present)\n  --patch-file (-p)                    patch file applied before setup.py\n                                       called (incompatible with file\n                                       specified in .cfg)\n  --patch-level (-l)                   patch file applied before setup.py\n                                       called (incompatible with file\n                                       specified in .cfg)\n  --patch-posix (-q)                   apply the patch with --posix mode\n  --remove-expanded-source-dir (-r)    remove the expanded source directory\n  --ignore-install-requires (-i)       ignore the requirements from\n                                       requires.txt in the egg-info directory\n  --guess-conflicts-provides-replaces  If True, attempt to guess\n                                       Conflicts/Provides/Replaces in\n                                       debian/control based on apt-cache\n                                       output.
