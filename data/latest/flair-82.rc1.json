Developed by [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/) and friends.\n\n---\n\nFlair is:\n\n* **A powerful NLP library.** Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)\nmodels to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (PoS), \n  special support for [biomedical data](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md),\n sense disambiguation and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages.\n\n* **A text embedding library.** Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word and\ndocument embeddings, including our proposed **[Flair embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/)**, BERT embeddings and ELMo embeddings.\n\n* **A PyTorch NLP framework.** Our framework builds directly on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), making it easy to\ntrain your own models and experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.\n\nNow at [version 0.8](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/releases)!\n\n\n## Join Us: Open Positions at HU-Berlin!\n\nIf you're interested in doing NLP/ML research to pursue a PhD and love open source, consider applying to [open positions](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/2342) for research associates and PhD candidates at Humboldt University Berlin! \n\n## State-of-the-Art Models\n\nFlair ships with state-of-the-art models for a range of NLP tasks. For instance, check out our latest NER models: \n\n| Language | Dataset | Flair | Best published | Model card & demo\n|  ---  | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| English | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **94.09**  | *94.3 [(Yamada et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.523)* | [Flair English 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-large)  |\n| English | Ontonotes (18-class)  |  **90.93**  | *91.3 [(Yu et al., 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair English 18-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-ontonotes-large) |\n| German  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **92.31**  | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair German 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-german-large)  |\n| Dutch  | Conll-03  (4-class)  |  **95.25**  | *93.7 [(Yu et al., 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Dutch 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-dutch-large)  |\n| Spanish  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **90.54** | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Spanish 18-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-spanish-large)  |\n\n**New:** Most Flair sequence tagging models (named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging etc.) are now hosted \non the [__🤗 HuggingFace model hub__](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=flair)! You can browse models, check detailed information on how they were trained, and even try each model out online!\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Requirements and Installation\n\nThe project is based on PyTorch 1.5+ and Python 3.6+, because method signatures and type hints are beautiful.\nIf you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. [Here is how for Ubuntu 16.04](https://vsupalov.com/developing-with-python3-6-on-ubuntu-16-04/).\nThen, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:\n\n```\npip install flair\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nLet's run named entity recognition (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load\na pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:\n\n```python\nfrom flair.data import Sentence\nfrom flair.models import SequenceTagger\n\n# make a sentence\nsentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')\n\n# load the NER tagger\ntagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')\n\n# run NER over sentence\ntagger.predict(sentence)\n```\n\nDone! The `Sentence` now has entity annotations. Print the sentence to see what the tagger found.\n\n```python\nprint(sentence)\nprint('The following NER tags are found:')\n\n# iterate over entities and print\nfor entity in sentence.get_spans('ner'):\n    print(entity)\n```\n\nThis should print:\n\n```console\nSentence: \"I love Berlin .\" - 4 Tokens\n\nThe following NER tags are found:\n\nSpan [3]: \"Berlin\"   [− Labels: LOC (0.9992)]\n```\n\n## Tutorials\n\nWe provide a set of quick tutorials to get you started with the library:\n\n* [Tutorial 1: Basics](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_1_BASICS.md)\n* [Tutorial 2: Tagging your Text](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_2_TAGGING.md)\n* [Tutorial 3: Embedding Words](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_3_WORD_EMBEDDING.md)\n* [Tutorial 4: List of All Word Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_4_ELMO_BERT_FLAIR_EMBEDDING.md)\n* [Tutorial 5: Embedding Documents](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_5_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDINGS.md)\n* [Tutorial 6: Loading a Dataset](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_6_CORPUS.md)\n* [Tutorial 7: Training a Model](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_7_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md)\n* [Tutorial 8: Training your own Flair Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_9_TRAINING_LM_EMBEDDINGS.md)\n* [Tutorial 9: Training a Zero Shot Text Classifier (TARS)](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_10_TRAINING_ZERO_SHOT_MODEL.md)\n\nThe tutorials explain how the base NLP classes work, how you can load pre-trained models to tag your\ntext, how you can embed your text with different word or document embeddings, and how you can train your own\nlanguage models, sequence labeling models, and text classification models. Let us know if anything is unclear.\n\nThere is also a dedicated landing page for our **[biomedical NER and datasets](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md)** with\ninstallation instructions and tutorials.\n\nThere are also good third-party articles and posts that illustrate how to use Flair:\n* [How to build a text classifier with Flair](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-state-of-the-art-nlp-library-flair-b541d7add21f)\n* [How to build a microservice with Flair and Flask](https://shekhargulati.com/2019/01/04/building-a-sentiment-analysis-python-microservice-with-flair-and-flask/)\n* [A docker image for Flair](https://towardsdatascience.com/docker-image-for-nlp-5402c9a9069e)\n* [Great overview of Flair functionality and how to use in Colab](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/02/flair-nlp-library-python/)\n* [Visualisation tool for highlighting the extracted entities](https://github.com/lunayach/visNER)\n* [Practical approach of State-of-the-Art Flair in Named Entity Recognition](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/practical-approach-of-state-of-the-art-flair-in-named-entity-recognition-46a837e25e6b)\n* [Benchmarking NER algorithms](https://towardsdatascience.com/benchmark-ner-algorithm-d4ab01b2d4c3)\n* [Training a Flair text classifier on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and serving predictions on GCP](https://github.com/robinvanschaik/flair-on-gcp)\n* [Model Interpretability for transformer-based Flair models](https://github.com/robinvanschaik/interpret-flair)\n\n## Citing Flair\n\nPlease cite [the following paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/) when using Flair embeddings:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{akbik2018coling,\n  title={Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling},\n  author={Akbik, Alan and Blythe, Duncan and Vollgraf, Roland},\n  booktitle = {{COLING} 2018, 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics},\n  pages     = {1638--1649},\n  year      = {2018}\n}\n```\n\nIf you use the Flair framework for your experiments, please cite [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/N/N19/N19-4010/):\n\n```\n@inproceedings{akbik2019flair,\n  title={FLAIR: An easy-to-use framework for state-of-the-art NLP},\n  author={Akbik, Alan and Bergmann, Tanja and Blythe, Duncan and Rasul, Kashif and Schweter, Stefan and Vollgraf, Roland},\n  booktitle={{NAACL} 2019, 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)},\n  pages={54--59},\n  year={2019}\n}\n```\n\nIf you use the pooled version of the Flair embeddings (PooledFlairEmbeddings), please cite [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/N/N19/N19-1078/):\n\n```\n@inproceedings{akbik2019naacl,\n  title={Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Named Entity Recognition},\n  author={Akbik, Alan and Bergmann, Tanja and Vollgraf, Roland},\n  booktitle = {{NAACL} 2019, 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics},\n  pages     = {724–728},\n  year      = {2019}\n}\n```\n\nIf you use our new \"FLERT\" models or approach, please cite [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06993):\n\n```\n@misc{schweter2020flert,\n    title={FLERT: Document-Level Features for Named Entity Recognition},\n    author={Stefan Schweter and Alan Akbik},\n    year={2020},\n    eprint={2011.06993},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={cs.CL}\n```\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease email your questions or comments to [Alan Akbik](http://alanakbik.github.io/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to get involved;\nstart with our [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and then\ncheck these [open issues](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues) for specific tasks.\n\nFor contributors looking to get deeper into the API we suggest cloning the repository and checking out the unit\ntests for examples of how to call methods. Nearly all classes and methods are documented, so finding your way around\nthe code should hopefully be easy.\n\n### Running unit tests locally\n\nYou need [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) for this:\n\n```bash\npipenv install --dev && pipenv shell\npytest tests/\n```\n\nTo run integration tests execute:\n```bash\npytest --runintegration tests/\n```\nThe integration tests will train small models.\nAfterwards, the trained model will be loaded for prediction.\n\nTo also run slow tests, such as loading and using the embeddings provided by flair, you should execute:\n```bash\npytest --runslow tests/\n```\n\n## [License](/LICENSE)\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nFlair is licensed under the following MIT license: The MIT License (MIT) Copyright © 2018 Zalando SE, https://tech.zalando.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
