    "description": "# A plugin to PyElastica for the simulation of HSA robots\n\nThis repository contains a plugin for  [PyElastica](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica) to simulate\nrobots based on Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA).\nElastica makes use of the Discrete Cosserat Rod Model (DCM) to simulate the behaviour of slender rods.\nWe model the HSA rods as Cosserat rods, but perform several modifications to the DCM to account for the auxetic behaviour of HSAs.\nNamely, we couple twist strains to an adjustment of the rest length of the rod.\nThis will let the rod extend when torsional torques are applied to it.\nAdditionally, the axial stiffness of the rod is modelled to be a linear function of the twist strain to account for a proportional \nincrease of the spring constant with increasing twist angles, as shown by Good et al. [[1]](#1) in their characterization \nof the mechanical properties of HSAs.\nWe refer to the [publication](##Citation) for more details.\n\nCurrently, we are able to simulate the behaviour of closed HSAs\n(i.e. the printed length is equal to the minimum length). Adaptations would be necessary to accommodate the simulation of \nsemi-closed and open HSAs. Specifically, this would include non-linear couplings between the twist strains \nand the material properties such as the axial stiffness.\n\nAt the moment, the plugin is only able to simulate the behaviour of a single-segment HSA robot.\nThis corresponds to a parallel arrangement of HSAs, where each HSA is connected to an electric actuator at its proximal end.\nAll HSA rods are attached at their distal end to a (circular) platform.\nAn extension to multi-segment HSA robots would require the implementation of different kinds of constraints,\njoints, etc.\n\n## Citation\nThis simulator is part of the publication **Modelling Handed Shearing Auxetics:\nSelective Piecewise Constant Strain Kinematics and Dynamic Simulation** presented at the \n_6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2023)_. \nYou can find the publication online on ~~IEEE Xplore~~.\n\nPlease use the following citation if you use our method in your (scientific) work:\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{stolzle2023modelling,\n  title={Modelling Handed Shearing Auxetics: Selective Piecewise Constant Strain Kinematics and Dynamic Simulation},\n  author={St{\\\"o}lzle, Maximilian and Chin, Lillian and Truby, Ryan L. and Rus, Daniela and Della Santina, Cosimo},\n  booktitle={2023 IEEE 6th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\nThe plugin can be installed from PyPI:\n\n```bash\npip install hsa-pyelastica\n```\n\nor locally from the source code:\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\nPlease note that this plugin is currently compatible with the PyElastica version 0.3.x.\nAny future changes in the private interface / API of PyElastica might break the plugin.\n\n## Usage\n\nWe provide two simulators: `HsaRodSimulator` and `HsaRobotSim`` to simulate individual HSA rods and assembled \nHSA robots, respectively.\n\n### HsaRodSimulator\n\nThe `HsaRodSimulator` can be used to simulate the behaviour of individual HSAs.\nFirst, we define the rod parameters:\n\n```python\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\nWe provide several scripts in the `examples` folder to get you started with the plugin.\n\n### Verification of simulator against experimental results by Good et al. [[1]](#1)\n\nThe command\n\n```bash\npython examples/hsa_rod/verification_sim_against_good_et_al/hsa_rod_steady_state_characterisation.py\n```\n\nsimulates the steady-state behaviour of individual HSA rods to identify several mechanical characteristics such as \nholding torque, minimum energy length, spring constant, and blocked force.\nWe have tuned the parameters of the simulator to match the experimental results of Good et al. [[1]](#1) as closely as \npossible.\nFinally, we compare the results of the simulation with the experimental results to verify the steady-state behaviour of the\nsimulator. This can be done by running the following command:\n\n```bash\npython examples/hsa_rod/verification_sim_against_good_et_al/plot_verification_sim_against_good_et_al.py\n```\n\n## See also\n\nYou might also be interested in the following repositories:\n\n - The [`jax-spcs-kinematics`](https://github.com/tud-cor-sr/jax-spcs-kinematics) repository contains an implementation\n of the Selective Piecewise Constant Strain (SPCS) kinematics in JAX. We have shown in our paper that this kinematic \nmodel is suitable for representing the shape of HSA rods.\n - You can find code and datasets used for the verification of the SPCS model for HSA robots in the \n[`hsa-kinematic-model`](https://github.com/tud-cor-sr/hsa-kinematic-model) repository.\n\n## References\n<a id=\"1\">[1]</a> Good, Ian, et al. \n\"Expanding the Design Space for Electrically-Driven Soft Robots Through Handed Shearing Auxetics.\" \n2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).
