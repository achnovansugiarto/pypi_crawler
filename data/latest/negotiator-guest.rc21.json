    "description": "Scriptable KVM/QEMU guest agent implemented in Python\n=====================================================\n\nThe Python packages negotiator-host_, negotiator-guest_ and negotiator-common_\ntogether implement a scriptable KVM_/QEMU_ guest agent infrastructure in\nPython. This infrastructure supports realtime bidirectional communication\nbetween Linux_ hosts and guests which allows the hosts and guests to invoke\nuser defined commands on 'the other side'.\n\nBecause the user defines the commands that hosts and guests can execute, the\nuser controls the amount of influence that hosts and guests have over each\nother (there are several built-in commands, these are all read only).\n\n.. contents::\n\nStatus\n------\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n- The Negotiator project does what I expect from it: realtime bidirectional\n  communication between Linux based KVM/QEMU hosts and guests.\n\n- The project doesn't have an automated test suite, although its functionality\n  has been extensively tested during development and is being used in a\n  production environment on more than 100 virtual machines (for non-critical\n  tasks).\n\n- The project has not been peer reviewed with regards to security. My primary\n  use case is KVM/QEMU hosts and guests that trust each other to some extent\n  (think private clouds, not shared hosting :-).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `negotiator` packages and their dependencies are compatible with Python 2.7\nand newer and are all pure Python. This means you don't need a compiler\ntoolchain to install the `negotiator` packages. This is a design decision and\nso won't be changed.\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nOn KVM/QEMU hosts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere's how to install the negotiator-host_ package on your host(s):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo pip install negotiator-host\n\nIf you prefer you can install the Python package in a virtual environment:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo apt-get install --yes python-virtualenv\n   $ virtualenv /tmp/negotiator-host\n   $ source /tmp/negotiator-host/bin/activate\n   $ pip install negotiator-host\n\nAfter installation the ``negotiator-host`` program is available. The usage\nmessage will help you get started, try the ``--help`` option. Now you need to\nfind a way to run the ``negotiator-host`` command as a daemon. I have good\nexperiences with supervisord_, here's how to set that up:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo apt-get install --yes supervisor\n   $ sudo tee /etc/supervisor/conf.d/negotiator-host.conf >/dev/null << EOF\n   [program:negotiator-host]\n   command = /usr/local/bin/negotiator-host --daemon\n   autostart = True\n   stdout_logfile = /var/log/negotiator-host.log\n   stderr_logfile = /var/log/negotiator-host.log\n   EOF\n   $ sudo supervisorctl update negotiator-host\n\nOn KVM/QEMU guests\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInstall the negotiator-guest_ package on your guest(s):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo pip install negotiator-guest\n\nIf you prefer you can install the Python package in a virtual environment:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo apt-get install --yes python-virtualenv\n   $ virtualenv /tmp/negotiator-guest\n   $ source /tmp/negotiator-guest/bin/activate\n   $ pip install negotiator-guest\n\nAfter installation you need to find a way to run the ``negotiator-guest``\ncommand as a daemon. I have good experiences with supervisord_, here's how\nto set that up:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ sudo apt-get install --yes supervisor\n   $ sudo tee /etc/supervisor/conf.d/negotiator-guest.conf >/dev/null << EOF\n   [program:negotiator-guest]\n   command = /usr/local/bin/negotiator-guest --daemon\n   autostart = True\n   stdout_logfile = /var/log/negotiator-guest.log\n   stderr_logfile = /var/log/negotiator-guest.log\n   EOF\n   $ sudo supervisorctl update negotiator-guest\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nIf the instructions below are not enough to get you started, take a look at the\n*Debugging* section below for hints about what to do when things don't work as\nexpected.\n\n1. First you have to add two virtual devices to your QEMU guest. You can do so\n   by editing the guest's XML definition file. On Ubuntu Linux KVM/QEMU hosts\n   these files are found in the directory ``/etc/libvirt/qemu``. Open the file\n   in your favorite text editor (Vim? :-) and add the the following XML snippet\n   inside the ``<devices>`` section:\n\n   .. code-block:: xml\n\n      <channel type='unix'>\n         <source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target/GUEST_NAME.negotiator-host-to-guest.0' />\n         <target type='virtio' name='negotiator-host-to-guest.0' />\n      </channel>\n\n      <channel type='unix'>\n         <source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target/GUEST_NAME.negotiator-guest-to-host.0' />\n         <target type='virtio' name='negotiator-guest-to-host.0' />\n      </channel>\n\n   Replace ``GUEST_NAME`` with the name of your guest in both places. If you\n   use libvirt 1.0.6 or newer (you can check with ``virsh --version``) you can\n   omit the ``path='...'`` attribute because libvirt will fill it in\n   automatically when it reloads the guest's XML definition file (in step 2).\n\n2. After adding the configuration snippet you have to activate it:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n      $ sudo virsh define /etc/libvirt/qemu/GUEST_NAME.xml\n\n3. Now you need to shut down the guest and then start it again:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n      $ sudo virsh shutdown --mode acpi GUEST_NAME\n      $ sudo virsh start GUEST_NAME\n\n   Note that just rebooting the guest will not add the new virtual devices, you\n   have to actually stop the guest and then start it again!\n\n4. Now go and create some scripts in ``/usr/lib/negotiator/commands`` and try\n   to execute them from the other side! Once you start writing your own\n   commands it's useful to know that commands on the KVM/QEMU host side have\n   access to some `environment variables`_.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis section documents the command line interfaces of the programs running on\nhosts and guests.

[[[end]]]\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\nThis section contains hints about what to do when things don't work as\nexpected.\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBroken channels on KVM/QEMU hosts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhether you want to get the official QEMU guest agent or the Negotiator project\nrunning, you will need a working bidirectional channel. I'm testing Negotiator\non an Ubuntu 14.04 KVM/QEMU host and I needed several changes to get things\nworking properly:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ CHANNELS_DIRECTORY=/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target\n   $ sudo mkdir -p $CHANNELS_DIRECTORY\n   $ sudo chown libvirt-qemu:kvm $CHANNELS_DIRECTORY\n\nThe above should be done by the KVM/QEMU system packages if you ask me, but\nanyway. On top of this if you are running Ubuntu with AppArmor enabled (the\ndefault) you may need to apply the following patch:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ diff -u /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu.orig /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu\n   --- /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu.orig      2015-09-19 12:46:54.316593334 +0200\n   +++ /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu   2015-09-24 14:43:43.642064576 +0200\n   @@ -49,6 +49,9 @@\n      /run/shm/ r,\n      owner /run/shm/spice.* rw,\n\n   +  # Local modification to enable the QEMU guest agent.\n   +  owner /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target/* rw,\n   +\n      # 'kill' is not required for sound and is a security risk. Do not enable\n      # unless you absolutely need it.\n      deny capability kill,\n\nAgain this should just be part of the KVM/QEMU system packages, but whatever.\nThe Negotiator project is playing with new-ish functionality so I pretty much\nknow to expect sharp edges :-)\n\nCharacter device detection fails\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen the ``negotiator-guest`` program fails to detect the correct character\ndevices it will complain loudly and point you here. Here are some of things\nI've run into that can cause this:\n\n- The virtual channel(s) have not been correctly configured or the correct\n  configuration hasn't been applied yet. Please carefully follow the\n  instructions in the *Getting started* section above.\n\n- The kernel module ``virtio_console`` is not loaded because it is not\n  available in your kernel. You can check by using the ``lsmod`` command. If\n  the module is not loaded you'll need to install and boot to a kernel that\n  does have the module.\n\nWhy another guest agent?\n------------------------\n\nThe QEMU project provides an `official guest agent`_ and this agent is very\nuseful to increase integration between QEMU hosts and guests. However the\nofficial QEMU guest agent has two notable shortcomings (for me at least):\n\n**Extensibility**\n  The official QEMU guest agent has some generic mechanisms like being able to\n  write files inside guests, but this is a far cry from a generic, extensible\n  architecture. Ideally given the host and guest's permission we should be able\n  to transfer arbitrary data and execute user defined logic on both sides.\n\n**Platform support**\n  Despite considerable effort I haven't been able to get a recent version of\n  the QEMU guest agent running on older Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu Linux\n  10.04). Older versions of the guest agent can be succesfully compiled for\n  such distributions but don't support the features I require. By creating my\n  own guest agent I have more control over platform support (given the\n  primitives required for communication).\n\nNote that my project in no way tries to replace the official QEMU guest agent.\nFor example I have no intention of implementing freezing and thawing of file\nsystems because the official agent already does that just fine :-). In other\nwords the two projects share a lot of ideas but have very different goals.\n\nHow does it work?\n-----------------\n\nThe scriptable guest agent infrastructure uses `the same mechanism`_ that the\nofficial QEMU guest agent does:\n\n- Inside the guest special character devices are created that allow reading and\n  writing. These character devices are ``/dev/vport[0-9]p[0-9]``.\n\n- On the host UNIX domain sockets are created that are connected to the\n  character devices inside the guest. On Ubuntu Linux KVM/QEMU hosts,\n  these UNIX domain sockets are created in the directory\n  ``/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target``.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nThe latest version of `negotiator` is available on PyPI_ and GitHub_.
