    "description": "# xcube_jl_ext\n\n[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-jl-ext/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-jl-ext/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n[xcube](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube) JupyterLab integration\n\nThis extension is composed of a Python package named `xcube_jl_ext`\nfor the JupyterLab server extension and a NPM package named `xcube-jl-ext`\nfor the JupyterLab frontend extension.\n\nThe extension adds the following features to JupyterLab:\n\n1. Allows running a configurable xcube Viewer as widget in the JupyterLab.\n2. Allows using xcube Server and Viewer from within Jupyter Notebooks, \n   even if JupyterLab is running remotely, i.e., spawned by JupyterHub.\n\n---\n**NOTE** \n\nThis extension is still experimental and has neither been packaged \nnor deployed. Refer to the section **Development** below for dev installs.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- JupyterLab >= 3.0\n- xcube >= 0.13\n\n## Install\n\nTo install the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip install xcube_jl_ext\n```\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo remove the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall xcube_jl_ext\n```\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check\nthat the server extension is enabled:\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension list\n```\n\nIf the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing\nthe frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup environment\n\nBuild [xcube Viewer](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-viewer) resources\nfrom sources. Note you'll need `yarn` to be installed on your system.\n\n```bash\ncd ${projects}\ngit clone https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-viewer.git\ncd xcube-viewer\nyarn install\nyarn build\n```\n\nNow set environment variable `XCUBE_VIEWER_PATH` to point\nto the xcube Viewer build directory:\n\n```env\nexport XCUBE_VIEWER_PATH=${projects}/xcube-viewer/build\n```\n\nMake sure to have a source installation \nof [xcube](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube) in a\ndedicated xcube Python environment. \n\n```bash\ncd ${projects}\ngit clone https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube.git\ncd xcube\nmamba env create\n```\n\nActivate `xcube` environment and install xcube in editable (development) mode:\n\n```bash\nconda activate xcube\npip install -ve .\n```\n\nUpdate environment with required packages for building and running\nthe JupyterLab extension.\n\nNote, the version of the `jupyterlab` in our development environment \nshould match the version of the target system. We also install\n`jupyter-server-proxy`.\n\n```bash\nmamba install -c conda-forge -c nodefaults jupyterlab=3.4.0 jupyter-server-proxy\n```\n\nAlso install some packaging and build tools:\n\n```bash\nmamba install -c conda-forge -c nodefaults nodejs jupyter-packaging\npip install build\n```\n\nRefer also to the [JupyterLab Extension Tutorial](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_tutorial.html)\nfor the use these tools.\n\n### Install extension from sources\n\nMake sure, `xcube` environment is active:\n\n```bash\nconda activate xcube\n```\n\nClone xcube JupyterLab extension repository next to the `xcube` source\nfolder:\n\n```bash\ncd ${projects}\ngit clone https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-jl-ext.git\ncd xcube-jl-ext\n```\n\nInstall the initial project dependencies and install the extension into \nthe JupyterLab environment. Copy the frontend part of the extension into \nJupyterLab. We can run this pip install command again every time we make \na change to copy the change into JupyterLab.\n\n```bash\npip install -ve .\n```\n\nCreate a symbolic link from JupyterLab to our source directory. \nThis means our changes are automatically available in JupyterLab:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension develop --overwrite .\n```\n\nIf successful, we can run JupyterLab and check if the extension\nworks as expected:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab\n```\n\n### Build after changes\n\nRun the following to rebuild the extension. This will be required\nafter any changes of `package.json` or changes of frontend TypeScript \nfiles and other resources.\n\n```bash\njlpm run build\n```\n\nIf you wish to avoid building after each change, you can run the \n\n```bash\njlpm run watch\n```\n\nfrom your extension directory in another terminal. \nThis will automatically compile the TypeScript files as they \nare changed and saved.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development install\n\nNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.\n\nThe `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\n# Change directory to the xcube_jl_ext directory\n# Install package in development mode\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode\njupyter server extension enable xcube_jl_ext\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nBy default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=False\n```\n\n### Development uninstall\n\n```bash\n# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode\njupyter server extension disable xcube_jl_ext\npip uninstall xcube_jl_ext\n```\n\nIn development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`\ncommand. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`\nfolder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `xcube-jl-ext` within that folder.\n\n### Testing the extension\n\n#### Server tests\n\nThis extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.\n\nInstall test dependencies (needed only once):\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n# Each time you install the Python package, you need to restore the front-end extension link\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n```\n\nTo execute them, run:\n\n```sh\npytest -vv -r ap --cov xcube_jl_ext\n```\n\n#### Frontend tests\n\nThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.\n\nTo execute them, execute:\n\n```sh\njlpm\njlpm test\n```\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nThis extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).\nMore precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.\n\nMore information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.\n\n### Packaging the extension\n\nSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)\n",
