However when confirming this purchase order, the generated receipt\npicking and its move will get the procurement group from the sale order, which\ndoesn't match the procurement group of the ensuing internal transfers, what\ncould be baffling for the stock operator who has to find the ensuing internal\ntransfer.\n\nMoreover, if the quantity is changed before confirming the purchase order, the\nreceipt picking will be generated with the PO's quantity, whereas the ensuing\nmoves and picking will still have the original quantity from the orderpoint.\nTherefore, if the quantity was reduced on the purchase order, the stock\noperator won't be able to close the move line in waiting state, although it's\nnot expected to receive more quantity until the next purchase order.\n\nInstead of provoking such headaches to stock operators, this module will\npropagate the procurement group and the quantity of the purchase order to the\nwhole chain of moves and reassign them to new pickings.\n\nThis allows to have a clear match through the procurement group between\npurchase order, receipts and internal transfers, and allows as well stock\noperators not to worry about missing quantities which weren't ordered in the\nfirst place.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/154/11.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock_logistics_workflow/issues>`_.
