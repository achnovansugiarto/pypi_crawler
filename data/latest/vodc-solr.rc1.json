    "description": "*********\nvodc.solr\n*********\n\nThis package provides a user interface from the VODC_ website (powered by\nPlone_) to the SOLR_ backend which has indexed *all* the oceanographic data.\n\nIt was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL_).\n\n.. References:\n.. _VODC: http://vodc.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _SOLR: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n* Add ``vodc.solr`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        vodc.solr\n\n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    $ ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou don't need to specify a ZCML slug because this package uses an `automatic\ninclusion mechanism`_.\n\n\n.. References:\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\n.. _`automatic inclusion mechanism`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.autoinclude\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0.0 — Cleaned Up\n------------------\n\nThis release makes vodc.solr compatible with Plone 4 and marks an official\nrelease as a Python egg.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Unreleased\n------------------\n\n* Initial release\n\n\n\nCopyright and License\n=====================\n\nCopyright © 2008–2012 by the California Institute of Technology.
