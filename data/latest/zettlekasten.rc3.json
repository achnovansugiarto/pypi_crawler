    "description": "# zettlekasten\n\nSoftware that try to implement a simple zettlekasten coded in Python.\n\n## Kesako?!\n\n> The Zettelkasten principles\n>\n> A Zettelkasten is a phenomenal tool for storing and organizing your\n> knowledge, extending your> memory, generating new connections\n> between ideas, and increasing your writing output. However, to make\n> the most of a Zettelkasten, you should follow some key principles.\n>\n> 1. The principle of atomicity: The term was coined by Christian\n>    Tietze. It means that each note should contain one idea and one\n>    idea only. This makes it possible to link ideas with a lase\n>    focus.\n>\n> 2. The principle of autonomy: Each note should be autonomous,\n>    meaning it should be self-contained and comprehensible on its\n>    own. This allows notes to be moved, processed, separated, and\n>    concatenated independently of its neighbors. It also ensures that\n>    notes remain useful even if the original source of information\n>    disappears.\n>\n> 3. Always link your notes: Whenever you add a note, make sure to\n>    link it to already existing notes. Avoid notes that are\n>    disconnected from other notes. As Luhmann himself put it, “each\n>    note is just an element that derives its quality from the network\n>    of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the\n>    network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten”\n>    (original in German).\n>\n> 4. Explain why you’re linking notes: Whenever you are connecting two\n>    notes by a link, make sure to briefly explain why you are linking\n>    them. Otherwise, years down the road when you revisit your notes,\n>    you may have no idea why you connected them.\n>\n> 5. Use your own words: Don’t copy and paste. If you come across an\n>    interesting idea and want to add it to your Zettelkasten, you\n>    must express that idea with your own words, in a way that you’ll\n>    be sure to understand years later. Don’t turn your Zettelkasten\n>    into a dump of copy-and-pasted information.\n>\n> 6. Keep references: Always add references to your notes so that you\n>    know where you got an idea from. This prevents plagiarism and\n>    makes it easy for you to revisit the original source later on.\n>\n> 7. Add your own thoughts to the Zettelkasten: If you have thoughts\n>    of your own, add them to the Zettelkasten as notes while keeping\n>    in mind the principle of atomicity, autonomy, and the need for\n>    linking.\n>\n> 8. Don’t worry about structure: Don’t worry about putting notes in\n>    neat folders or into unique preconceived categories. As Schmidt\n>    put it, in a Zettelkasten “there are no privileged positions” and\n>    “there is no top and no bottom.” The organization develops\n>    organically.\n>\n> 9. Add connection notes: As you begin to see connections among\n>    seemingly random notes, create connection notes, that is,\n>    specific notes whose purpose is to link together other notes and\n>    explain their relationship.\n>\n> 10. Add outline notes: As ideas begin to coalesce into themes,\n>     create outline notes. An outline note is a note that simply\n>     contains a sequence of links to other notes, putting those other\n>     notes into a particular order to create a story, narrative, or\n>     argument.\n>\n> 11. Never delete: Don’t delete old notes. Instead, link to new notes\n>     that explain what’s wrong with the old ones. In that way, your\n>     Zettelkasten will reflect how your thinking has evolved over\n>     time, which will prevent hindsight bias. Moreover, if you don’t\n>     delete, you might revisit old ideas that may turn out to be\n>     correct after all.\n>\n> 12. Add notes without fear: You can never have too much information\n>     in your Zettelkasten. At worst, you’ll add notes that won’t be\n>     of immediate use. But adding more notes will never break your\n>     Zettelkasten or interfere with its proper operation. Remember,\n>     Luhmann had 90,000 notes in his Zettelkasten!\n>\n> https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125\n",
