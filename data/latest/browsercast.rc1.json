    "description": "BrowserCast is an IPython Notebook plugin which allows IPython Notebook\nnotebooks to be set to audio, creating a screencast-style presentation in the\nbrowser - a browser cast.\n\n**Status**: BrowserCast is under active development, and should work well\nenough that you can use it to create useful presentations! It is currently\nimplemented as a bookmarklet instead of a \"real\" Notebook plugin, but that\nwill change soon. To give it a try, see: http://wolever.github.io/browsercast/\n\nTraditional screencasts talking about BrowserCast:\n\n* Why is BrowserCast cool? http://youtu.be/OAIyHgbi5rM\n* Creating a presentation with BrowserCast: http://youtu.be/UhHRuPPFWtE\n* Old proof-of-concept demonstration: http://youtu.be/CYxZq4rZw0c\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n| Q: What about recording audio in the browser too?\n| A: Unfortunately the APIs aren't great at the moment, and Audacity is a very\n     good tool for creating and editing audio.\n\n| Q: Can people watching a browsercast interact with the IPython notebook?\n| A: In theory they can, but there are some technical challenges that make it\n     unlikely to be properly supported.",
