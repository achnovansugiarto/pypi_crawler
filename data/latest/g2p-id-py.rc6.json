We followed the methods and designs used in the English equivalent library, [g2p](https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install g2p_id_py\n```\n\n## How to Use\n\n```py\nfrom g2p_id import G2p\n\ntexts = [\n    \"Apel itu berwarna merah.\",\n    \"Rahel bersekolah di S M A Jakarta 17.\",\n    \"Mereka sedang bermain bola di lapangan.\",\n]\n\ng2p = G2p()\nfor text in texts:\n    print(g2p(text))\n\n>> [['a', 'p', 'ə', 'l'], ['i', 't', 'u'], ['b', 'ə', 'r', 'w', 'a', 'r', 'n', 'a'], ['m', 'e', 'r', 'a', 'h'], ['.']]\n>> [['r', 'a', 'h', 'e', 'l'], ['b', 'ə', 'r', 's', 'ə', 'k', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'h'], ['d', 'i'], ['e', 's'], ['e', 'm'], ['a'], ['dʒ', 'a', 'k', 'a', 'r', 't', 'a'], ['t', 'u', 'dʒ', 'u', 'h'], ['b', 'ə', 'l', 'a', 's'], ['.']]\n>> [['m', 'ə', 'r', 'e', 'k', 'a'], ['s', 'ə', 'd', 'a', 'ŋ'], ['b', 'ə', 'r', 'm', 'a', 'i', 'n'], ['b', 'o', 'l', 'a'], ['d', 'i'], ['l', 'a', 'p', 'a', 'ŋ', 'a', 'n'], ['.']]\n```\n\n## Algorithm\n\nThis is heavily inspired from the English [g2p](https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p).\n\n1. Spells out arabic numbers and some currency symbols, e.g. `Rp 200,000 -> dua ratus ribu rupiah`. This is borrowed from [Cahya's code](https://github.com/cahya-wirawan/text_processor).\n2. Attempts to retrieve the correct pronunciation for homographs based on their [POS (part-of-speech) tags](#pos-tagging).\n3. Looks up a lexicon (pronunciation dictionary) for non-homographs. This list is originally from [ipa-dict](https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict/blob/master/data/ma.txt), and we later made a modified version.\n4. For OOVs, we predict their pronunciations using either a [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/bookbot/id-g2p-bert) or an [LSTM model](https://huggingface.co/bookbot/id-g2p-lstm).\n\n## Phoneme and Grapheme Sets\n\n```python\ngraphemes = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\nphonemes = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'ɡ', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'z', 'ŋ', 'ə', 'ɲ', 'tʃ', 'ʃ', 'dʒ', 'x', 'ʔ']\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nYou can find more details on how we handled homographs and out-of-vocabulary prediction on our [documentation](https://bookbot-kids.github.io/g2p_id/algorithm/) page.\n\n## References\n\n```bib\n@misc{g2pE2019,\n  author = {Park, Kyubyong & Kim, Jongseok},\n  title = {g2pE},\n  year = {2019},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p}}\n}\n```\n\n```bib\n@misc{TextProcessor2021,\n  author = {Cahya Wirawan},\n  title = {Text Processor},\n  year = {2021},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/cahya-wirawan/text_processor}}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bookbot-kids/g2p_id/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=bookbot-kids/g2p_id\" />\n</a>\n",
