    "description": "# GTK Theme for Python's tkinter/ttk\n![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/TkinterEP/python-gttk.svg?branch=master)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/80y25364onq2anmw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RedFantom/python-gttk/branch/master)\n\nWould you like to have a more native look for your Tkinter application?\nAre the themes provided in [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes)\nnot to your liking?\n\nThis package provides a version of [`gtkTtk`](https://github.com/Geballin/gtkTtk),\nformerly [`tilegtk`](https://github.com/xiaq/tile-gtk) packaged for\nusage with Python. Simply follow the installation instructions and all\nrequired files are installed to the site package directory.\n\n## Installation\nCurrently, a build process for Linux and Windows is available. If you\nwould like  to use the package on OS X, please let me know so we can\nwork on a build system.\n\n### Wheels\nCurrently, wheels are provided for Windows. The Linux wheels are built\nwith Travis-CI and are thus not `manylinux` wheels. Therefore, building\nyourself is recommended when using Linux (either from the source dist\nfrom PyPI or this repository). Feel free to open an issue if you\nencounter any problems building!\n\n### Linux\nThese instructions are for Ubuntu, Python 3.5 or higher. Any lower \nversion may work, but is not supported. On other distributions, package \nnames may be different.\n```bash\n# Build Tools\nsudo apt install build-essential cmake\n# Required Libraries\nsudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev tcl-dev tk-dev\n# Required Python packages\npython -m pip install scikit-build\n\npython setup.py install \n``` \n\n### Windows (64-bit only)\nThese instructions assume you have [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)\ninstalled, with the MinGW toolchain. The `setup.py` script will check\nthe additional build dependencies and install them when required.\n\nBoth the MSYS `bin` directory as well as the MinGW `bin` directory must\nbe on the `PATH` to run the `setup.py` script. Usually, these folders\nare `C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin` and `C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin`, but they may differ\nfor your installation.\n\nIn addition to this, the `setup.py` script expects the `Dependencies` \nprogram found [here](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) to be \ninstalled under `deps/Dependencies.exe` by default. This tool is used\nto find all DLL-files necessary to run `gttk` without any external files.\n\nIf you have satisfied all requirements, assuming you want to install \nthe package *outside* of your MSYS installation:\n```bash\n# Replace C:\\Python with the path to your Python setup\n# The MSYS version of Python is on PATH and thus you should use an abspath!\nC:\\Python\\python.exe setup.py install\n``` \n\nThe binary distribution of `gttk` will come with all DLL-files known to\nbe required to run it. These DLL-files are generally available under\ntheir own specific licenses, as covered in the files that are found in\nthe MSYS directory `/share/licenses`.\n\n## Usage\nSimply import the package and instantiate the `GTTK` class. Then the \ntheme will become available for usage in a `ttk.Style`.\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import ttk\nfrom gttk import GTTK\n\nwindow = tk.Tk()\ngttk = GTTK(window)\nstyle = ttk.Style()\nstyle.theme_use(\"gttk\")\nprint(gttk.get_current_theme()) # Prints the active GTK theme\ngttk.set_gtk_theme(\"Yaru\") # Sets GTK theme, provided by developer\nttk.Button(window, text=\"Destroy\", command=window.destroy).pack()\n\nwindow.mainloop()\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error because you are running in the repository, \ndirectory, make sure to disallow imports from the working directory\nbefore importing `gttk`:\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.path = sys.path[2:]\nimport gttk\n```\n\n## Screenshots\n`gttk` should work with any GTK theme you can throw at it, but below\nare the themes Yaru and Adwaita as examples.\n\n![Yaru Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedFantom/python-gttk/master/screenshots/yaru.png)\n![Adapta Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedFantom/python-gttk/master/screenshots/adwaita.png)\n\n## License and Copyright\nThis repository provides a wrapper around `gttk`, which is a renamed \nversion of `gtkTtk`, which in turn is a renamed version of `tile-gtk`.\nThe original `tile-gtk` is available under hte MIT License. This version\nis available only under GNU GPLv3.\n\n```\npython-gttk \nCopyright (c) 2008-2012 Georgios Petasis\nCopyright (c) 2012 Cheer Xiao\nCopyright (c) 2019-2020 GÃ©ballin\nCopyright (c) 2020 RedFantom\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n```\n\n## Project State\n`tile-gtk`, `gtkTtk` and hence also `gttk` are far from perfect. You may\nencounter various graphical artifacts when using particular themes,\nwhile others work without flaws.\n\nYou are welcome to report any issues, and pull requests are even better.\nCurrently the package can only be built for Linux-based systems and \nattempts to create a process for building on Windows using MSYS and\nCMake have proven unfruitful. If you would like to give it a go, \nfeel free to contact me.",
