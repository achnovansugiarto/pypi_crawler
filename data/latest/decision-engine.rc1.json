    "description": "# Decision Engine\n\n - the integration of ostensibly disparate models of decision automation into\n   clear decision-centric interfaces.\n\nSeveral libraries exist with the isolated forms of the models we're using with\ninterfaces that expect ...\n\nOur goal is to abstract that by one step to create an application-centric \ntoolset.\n\nThe challenge this library attempts to solve is the integration of these \ndifferent sets of models all under the interface structure of optimizing.\ndiscrete actions in the real world.\n\n# Model To-Do:\n* gaussian thompson bandit ...\n* UCB ... (no multi-sample)\n* ... going to need some data generation infrastructure built\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation can be \n* of this repo as a package to allow usage of this repo into a different \n  project\n* of a sufficient python environment to allow further development.\n\ndone as a package to later be installed elsewhere or of \n\n\nLeverage the python package functionality to do a minimal installation of the \nmodels and surrounding piping as a stand-alone package.  Use this repo directly\nand set up a local to further develop this package.\n\n# Package Build and Install\nWe use Python's `setuptools` to handle installation.\nYou can build the wheel and install it elsewhere manually using:\n\n```shell\n# from within this repo's root:\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\n\n# from within your other project that you're installing this wheel into:\npip install decision_engine-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n\nOr you can install it directly from Github usisng the library name\n`git+ssh://git@github.com/BellwethrInc/decision-engine.git` as you would\ninstall any other library through either a `pip install [x]` or including it\ndirectly in your `requirements.txt` file.\n\nOr if you prefer using `https` rather than ssh to connect to github, \n`git+https://github.com/BellwethrInc/decision-engine.git` works as well.\n\n\nAfter we get proper releases set up, you'll be able to do \n`git+ssh://git@github.com/BellwethrInc/decision-engine.git@v0.0.0#egg=decision_engine` \nto specify a release as well.\n\nComing soon: \n* proper versioning\n* pypi-based install\n\n\n# As a Developer\n\nWithin this repo's root, create a virtualenv (or your conda equivalent) and\ninstall the dependencies.\n\n```shell\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nModels\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Bandits\nWhile bandits are traditionally framed as a learner that dials in to the most\nrewarding action based on actual returns from the different actions sampled, \nthe state within a bandit at any given moment can be trivially re-built from \nrecords of past treatments and responses.\n\nThis results in two shapes of interfaces:\n1. A \"model\" that is trained on historical data, is its own object to be \n  persisted, with the expectation that you'll keep training it as you use it\n  to make further decisions.\n1. A simple aggregation of historical data where the observed statistics also \n  allows optimized selection of next actions.\n\nThe bandit models included here have overlapping interfaces that allow the \nfirst and/or the second pattern to be used.  For example, a model that was\ntrained live using the first pattern would be identical to another model that\nwas trained from scratch using the aggregated data that was fed to the first\nmodel.  Both the live-built and the rebult-from-historical-data models could\nthen be used as live models for future decisions.\n\n## Batch\nSome training methods lend themselves nicely to pulling sets of next-actions\nwhile some don't.  (coming soon...)\n\n## Nonstationary\n - coming soon.  default behavior decays on a per-sample.  However, our use\n   cases would more practicaly decay from timestamp.\n\n# Contextual Bandits\n - coming soon\n\n\n",
