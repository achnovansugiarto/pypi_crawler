    "description": "# GRENML Parsing Library\n\n## Overview\n\nThe GRENML library acts as temporary data storage and manager and converting data loaded into an XML\nfile following the GRENML XML schema for data sharing purposes.\n\nAll data loaded in is loaded into RAM until writen to the XML file.\n\nThis library also contains a parser to read a GRENML XML file into memory.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGRENML is designed to be compatible with Python versions 3.4 and later.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nPlease refer the [quick start](https://code.canarie.ca/gren_map/grenml/-/tree/master/docs/quick-start.md) for an easy reference on how to get started with the \nGRENML library.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to the documentation located [here](https://code.canarie.ca/gren_map/grenml/-/tree/master/docs/index.md) for a full list\nof classes and functionality that this library offers.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [contributing document](https://code.canarie.ca/gren_map/grenml/-/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the process for submitting pull requests.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease read the [code of conduct document](https://code.canarie.ca/gren_map/grenml/-/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details on the code of conduct.\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to the [license](https://code.canarie.ca/gren_map/grenml/-/tree/master/LICENSE) for details on the project license.\n\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.
