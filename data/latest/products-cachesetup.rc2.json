    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nCacheFu speeds up Plone sites transparently using a combination \nof memory, proxy, and browser caching. Can be used by itself or \nwith Squid, Varnish, and/or Apache. Once installed, your site\nshould run much faster (about 10x faster by itself or\nabout 50x faster with Squid).\n\nCacheFu is a collection of products and recipes.  The central \nproduct is ``Products.CacheSetup`` which when installed via \neasy_install or buildout takes care of pulling in the rest of\nthe products from the bundle.\n\nThe full bundle includes:\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.CacheSetup\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.CMFSquidTool\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PageCacheManager\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PolicyHTTPCacheManager\n\nAdditional optional components include some Squid, Varnish, and\nApache configuration helpers.  See the installation instructions\nfor more info about these.\n\nThe latest information about releases can be found at \nhttp://plone.org/products/cachefu\n\nCacheFu has been tested with Plone 2.5+ and Plone 3.0.\nFor earlier Plone versions, try the CacheFu 1.0.3 bundle \ninstead.\n\n\nProducts.CacheSetup Installation\n================================\n\n``Products.CacheSetup`` is the python egg version of the old\n``CacheSetup`` product.  The egg version automatically takes\ncare of installing all the dependancies that make up the\nCacheFu bundle.  However, the proxy cache configs must\nstill be downloaded and configured separately.\n\nReferences to the \"Manual\" below refer to the new CacheFu\nmanual nearing completion as of this release.  Visit the \nofficial CacheFu site, http://plone.org/products/cachefu, \nfor the latest instructions.\n\nThere are three options for installation, and then some\npost-installation steps:\n\n\n(1) Global Install\n------------------\n\nTo install ``Products.CacheSetup`` into the global Python\nenvironment (or a workingenv) using a traditional Zope 2\ninstance:\n\n* Run ``easy_install Products.CacheSetup``. \n  Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here:\n  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall\n\n* If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_\n  and install it into your Zope instance via::\n\n      python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance\n\n.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts\n\n\n(2) Local Install (standard buildout install)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTo install ``Products.CacheSetup`` into the local zope instance\nif you are using ``zc.buildout`` and the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``\nrecipe to manage your project:\n\n* Add ``Products.CacheSetup`` to the list of eggs to\n  install::\n \n      [buildout]\n      ...\n      eggs =\n          ...\n          Products.CacheSetup\n\n* Re-run buildout::\n\n      $ ./bin/buildout\n\n\n(3) Local Install (old style Product install)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBecause its top level python namespace package is called\n``Products``, this package can also be installed in Zope 2\nas an old style *Zope 2 Product*.\n\nFor an old style Product install, move (or symlink) the\n``CacheSetup`` folder of this project\n(``Products.CacheSetup/Products/CacheSetup``) into the\n``Products`` directory of the Zope instance, and restart\nthe server.\n\nNote that in this case, dependancies are not automatically\ninstalled so you will have to repeat this process for\nthe rest of the CacheFu bundle: ``Products.CMFSquidTool``,\n``Products.PageCacheManager``, and ``Products.PolicyHTTPCacheManager``.\n\n\nPost-Installation Steps\n-----------------------\n\nIf installing for the first time:\n\n* After starting up Zope, install the CacheSetup product \n  via the Plone \"Add/Remove Products\" page\n\n* Optional: Configure via the \"Cache Configuration Tool\"\n  (see \"Configuring CacheFu\" in the Manual)\n\n* Optional: Install and configure Squid or Varnish\n  (see below)\n\n\nIf upgrading from a pre-1.2 version:\n\n* Remove the previous version from the Products \n  directory of the instance.  ``CacheSetup``, ``CMFSquidTool``,\n  ``PageCacheManager``, and ``PolicyHTTPCacheManager`` have all\n  been replaced by ``Products.CacheSetup``, ``Products.CMFSquidTool``,\n  etc.  If CacheFu was previously installed in a buildout\n  via ``plone.recipe.distros``, then remove the old CacheFu\n  settings from this section and re-run buildout.\n\n* Restart Zope\n\n* Click on the reinstall link next to the CacheSetup\n  product in the Plone \"Add/Remove Products\" page\n\n* Note: A reinstall keeps your old pre-1.1 configuration\n  in a Cache Policy named \"Old Cache Policy\".  Any other\n  cache policies with ids that conflict with the new ones\n  will be backed up and relabeled appropriately\n\n* Optional: Configure via the \"Cache Configuration Tool\"\n  (see \"Configuring CacheFu\" in the Manual)\n\n* Optional: Install and configure Squid or Varnish\n  (see below)\n\n* IMPORTANT: There is no upgrade path from the pre-1.0\n  versions of CacheFu.  In this case, the old CacheFu\n  products should be completely uninstalled via the Plone\n  \"Add/Remove Products\" page and then deleted from the\n  Products directory of the instance BEFORE installing\n  the new version.\n\n\nProxy Cache Installation and Configuration\n------------------------------------------\n\nBuildout recipes for building and configuring Squid, Varnish,\nand Apache are available:\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.squid\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.varnish\n\n* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.apache\n\nPreviously, the CacheFu bundle also included a collection of\nauto-generated proxy configs for Squid, Varnish, and Apache.\nStarting with version 1.2, this collection is now maintained\nas a separate download found at http://plone.org/products/cachefu\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nChangelog for the current CacheFu release.  For a history of changes\nprior to this release, see docs/HISTORY.txt\n\n\n1.2.1 - released 2009-05-17\n---------------------------\n\nRelease manager:\n  Ricardo Newbery, ric@digitalmarbles.com\nCompatible with:\n  Plone 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, and 2.5\n\n- Convert view name to string type before looking up matching cache rules.\n  Also fix up base_cache_rule._associateTemplate to ignore NotFound errors.\n  Thanks to Silvio Tomatis for the report.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed a Plone 2.5 incompatibility in exportimport/atcontent.py.\n  Thanks to Kai Lautaportti for the patch.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Added a workaround to fix creating GenericSetup snapshots.\n  [rossp]\n\n- Added at_download purge URLs for files and images.  Fixes a problem\n  with stale file downloads.\n  [rossp]\n\n- Changed over to a \"version-less\" naming of policies to make GenericSetup\n  updates more sane.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Don't throw an error in Plone 2.5 if all the 'folder_buttons' actions\n  have been deleted/hidden.  That's an odd configuration since it makes\n  folder_contents views useless but we should still not throw an error.\n  Fixes http://plone.org/products/cachefu/issues/141\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed a bug where Accept-Encoding was showing up twice in the Vary\n  header.  Also made setVaryHeader a bit smarter about what values\n  are required so instead of throwing a validation error we now just\n  quietly fix the obvious omissions.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Added a free-form, syntax-checked field to the list of headers\n  that a headerset can apply.  We now support surrogate cache control.\n  [newbery]\n\n- A CMFQuickInstaller uninstall/install after a GenericSetup install\n  appears broken somehow. It's as if GS-installed tools do not get\n  properly unregistered by QI (this is unconfirmed), but oddly a zope\n  restart after a QI uninstall fixes this.  But if a restart is not done,\n  one consequence is that setTitle never gets called because getToolByName\n  says the cachetool exists already.  Since title is a required field\n  but hidden in the edit form, this makes it impossible to enable CacheFu.\n  QI is going away soon anyway so we punt on this bug and just call\n  setTitle unconditionally.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Added missing workflow binding for CachePolicy entry in the\n  GenericSetup workflow.xml settings.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Added missing title for RuleFolder/HeaderSetFolder entries in the\n  GenericSetup cache settings.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed a GS setuphandlers issue where importing ObjectInitializedEvent\n  breaks in Plone 2.5.  Thanks to Kai Lautaportti for the report.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed a boolean issue seen in Plone 2.5 where setEnabled() fails due\n  to an inappropriate type comparison.  Thanks to Kai Lautaportti for\n  the report.  Fixes http://plone.org/products/cachefu/issues/143\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed up the version checking.  We now no longer rely on quickinstaller\n  to keep track of the installed version since qi is unreliable on\n  product path changes and during some GS installs.  We also now no\n  longer do a \"full\" disable during version mismatches -- we don't need\n  need to anymore since everything now respects the 'enabled' flag.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Fixed up the CacheFu Caching Policy Manager so that it respects the\n  CacheSetup 'enabled' field.  We don't have to delete this tool now\n  in order to turn off caching behavior.\n  [newbery]\n\n- Use the FasterStringIO from CMFPlone/patches/unicodehacks instead of the\n  standard StringIO to avoid issues due to a mix of strings and unicode.\n  [fschulze]\n\n- Improve the GenericSetup export code:\n\n  - Also export the title field for header and rule sets.\n  - PolicyHTTPCacheManagerCacheRule also needs the basic header set fields.\n  - Import sub-items before importing the object itself so references\n    work correctly.\n\n  [wichert]\n\n- Add missing title for entries in the GenericSetup cache settings.\n  [wichert]\n\n\n- If we silently ignore the 'enable CacheFu' option when the user is changing\n  the cache tool settings show a very clear warning.\n  [wichert]\n\n- Fixed two return values in patch_cmf.py. In Plone 3 you need to return\n  Unicode all the time. Otherwise PageTemplate files in the ZODB would generate\n  an assertion error in pt_render, complaining about the empty string not being\n  Unicode.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Add a vocabulary which lists all header sets.\n  [wichert]",
