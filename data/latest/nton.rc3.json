If you do not do this then NTON will not be able to\nfind any of the binaries.\n\n  [winget]: <https://winget.run>\n  [chocolatey]: <https://chocolatey.org>\n  [hacBrewPack]: <https://github.com/The-4n/hacBrewPack>\n  [ImageMagick]: <https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php>\n  [nstool]: <https://github.com/jakcron/nstool>\n  [hptnacp]: <https://github.com/The-4n/hacPack/tree/master/hacPack-Tools/hacPackTools-NACP>\n\n### Keys\n\nNTON requires the use of proprietary key data for use in various ways.\n\nPlace your `prod.keys` file at `C:\\Users\\<User>\\.switch\\prod.keys` or in your current working directory for\nNTON to be able to find and use your keys.\n\nMake sure your `prod.keys` file is up-to-date for the firmware version your Nintendo Switch is on. It can be extracted\nfrom your Nintendo Switch with [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM).\n\n### From Source Code\n\nThe following steps are instructions on downloading, preparing, and running the code under a Poetry environment.\nYou can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `pip install .` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/rlaphoenix/nton`\n2. `cd nton`\n3. (optional) `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` \n4. `poetry install`\n5. `poetry run nton --help`\n\nAs seen in Step 5, running the `nton` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.\nSee [Poetry's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.\n\n  [Python]: <https://python.org>\n  [Poetry]: <https://python-poetry.org>\n  [Poetry's Docs]: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment>\n\n## Usage\n\nTake a look at `nton --help`, specifically `nton build --help`.  \nIf you simply want to take an NRO and get an NSP forwarder, simply run `nton build \"<nro path>\"`.\n\nNote that the NRO path MUST be on your Switch microSD card. Do not provide a path in your C:/ Drive or such.\nTwo different kinds of paths are used based on the initial file path, therefore it must be from your Switch microSD\ncard.\n\nE.g., to make a forwarder for the Homebrew Menu that's on your Switch's microSD at `D:\\hbmenu.nro`, simply run\n`nton build \"D:/hbmenu.nro\"`\n\nTake a look at `nton build --help` for advanced usage like changing the Icon, Title Name, and so on.\n\n### Direct RetroArch Game forwarding\n\nUse a RetroArch Game Core as the NRO path and provide the path to the ROM on your Switch's microSD card with `--rom`.  \nThis will then load the Core directly under RetroArch and provide the path to the ROM as a startup argument to the\nRetroArch Core.\n\nNote:\n\n- You must use a path to a RetroArch Game Core NRO, not the path to the RetroArch NRO itself.\n- Do not move, delete, or rename the ROM or the Core NRO files that are on your microSD card, or it will break.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBefore continuing try running the homebrew from the Homebrew Launcher and see if it works through there.\nIf it does not work through the Homebrew launcher either, then it was never the forwarder's fault and you should\ncheck on your NRO or application installation.\n\nPlease note that using Forwarders others have created has a good chance of not working on your system.\nThe location of the NRO on their system may differ from the location on your system, hence the NSP won't be able\nto load the homebrew.\n\n### The forwarder does not launch, \"The software was closed because an error occurred.\"\n\nYou're sigpatches that allow non-signed software to launch is outdated or not set up correctly.\nThe `prod.keys` you used to create the NSP may also be outdated. Get new ones with [Lockpick_RCM] and\nmake sure you choose to get keys from whichever SysNAND or EmuNAND is actually on the latest firmware.\n\n### The forwarder starts loading but then crashes\n\nIf it gets to the black loading screen with the Nintendo Switch logo, but then crashes, you may be setting\nthe NRO path wrong when making the NSP. Make sure it starts with `/` and is an absolute path to an existing\nNRO file on your Switch's microSD card. The path you built for must be where the NRO file lies in your Switch's\nmicroSD card, not your PC.\n\n### The forwarder's icon is a '?'\n\nThe `icon_AmericanEnglish.dat` is not to the spec that Nintendo likes in some way. This is usually caused by the format of the\nimage not being a JPEG, or it has EXIF data or an embedded color space.\n\nI recommend stripping all EXIF metadata and saving without an Embed Color Space. You can do this quickly with ImageMagick,\n`magick mogrify -format jpg -resize 256x256 -strip \"C:\\Users\\John\\Downloads\\icon.png\"`.\n\n### The forwarder randomly stopped working after a while, I changed nothing!\n\nYou most likely updated your Switch's Firmware and need to update your sigpatches. If not, you may have deleted the NRO from\nyour Switch's microSD card or moved the NRO somewhere else. It cannot be moved as the built NSP loads the NRO at the specified\npath when you ran `build`.\n\nIt's also possible the firmware update has broken the [forwarder ROM][ROM] that is used and needs to be fixed.\nFirmware 9.0.0 and 12.0.0 are times the firmware has broken different forwarder ROMs in the past.\n\n## Credit\n\n- [meliodas2255] for their [Open-Source forwarder ROM][ROM] supporting v12.0.0+ with both direct RetroArch Forwarding\n  and general forwarding both supported.\n- [vgmoose] for the [sdl-hello-world] NRO that is used in CI/CD testing.\n\n  [meliodas2255]: <https://gbatemp.net/members/meliodas2255.410353>\n  [vgmoose]: <https://github.com/vgmoose>\n  [ROM]: <https://github.com/Skywalker25/Forwarder-Mod>\n  [sdl-hello-world]: <https://github.com/vgmoose/sdl-hello-world>\n\n## License\n\n[GNU General Public License, Version 3.0](LICENSE)\n",
