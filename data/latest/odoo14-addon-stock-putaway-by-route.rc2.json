When the putaway rules are applied, if a\nrule is defined on the replenishment route, the destination move will be changed\nto the one of the rule.\n\nThe rules for the route are applied when no rule for product and categories have\nbeen found.\n\nWhen the put-away strategy by route is applied it looks:\n\n1. If the move has a Stock Rule, it searches a put-away rule which has the\n   same Rule's Route\n2. Otherwise, if the Product has Route(s), it searches a put-away rule which\n   has any Route of the product set (it takes the first found)\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_putaway_by_route%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n\nTrobz\n\n* Dung Tran <dungtd@trobz.com>\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe development of this module has been financially supported by:\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/14.0/stock_putaway_by_route>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
