    "description": "Flatpak packaging for pygame\n\n`Flatpak <http://flatpak.org/>`__ is a sandboxed application packaging system\nfor Linux (`developer docs <http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/index.html>`__).\nPygame is a framework for making games.\n\nThis is an *experimental* tool to make Flatpak packages for pygame games. To use\nit:\n\n1. You will need a Linux system with Flatpak >= 0.8 installed, such as Fedora 25\n   or Ubuntu 17.10.\n2. Install using ``pip install pygame_fpak``. The tool needs Python 3 to run,\n   even if your game uses Python 2.\n3. Create a ``pygame-fpak.toml`` config file like this:\n\n   .. code-block:: toml\n   \n       # At the moment, you can specify \"3.6\", \"3.4\" or \"2.7\".\n       # 3.6 produces a somewhat bigger app to download.\n       python = \"3.6\"\n       # User-visible name\n       name = \"Solarwolf\"\n       # Identifier based on a reverse domain name you control. E.g. if your\n       # project is on Github, you could use io.github.username.reponame\n       appid = \"org.pygame.solarwolf\"\n       # Files/directories needed to run the game - relative paths from where\n       # the config file lives.\n       files = [\n         \"solarwolf\"\n       ]\n       # The function to start your game. This will be called like:\n       # from solarwolf.cli import main; main()\n       entry-point = \"solarwolf.cli:main\"\n\n       # Icons in different sizes. Icons should be square, sizes are pixels\n       # along one side of a square. 32, 48 and 64 are common.\n       [icons]\n       64 = \"dist/solarwolf.png\"\n\n4. Run ``python3 -m pygame_fpak pygame-fpak.toml``.\n\n------\n\nThe other code in this repo builds the base apps for the tool described above.\nTo build & install them:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    # Slow, but only needed once:\n    make install-runtime\n    \n    # Build the base applications and install them:\n    make install-baseapp-py36.done\n    make install-baseapp-py34.done\n    make install-baseapp-py27.done\n\nThere are three variants of the base application:\n\n- ``-py36`` includes Python 3.6 as ``/app/bin/python3``. This is approximately\n  30 MiB to download, and 140 MiB when installed. The *Aliens* example is built\n  on this by default.\n- ``-py34`` uses Python 3.4, which is provided by the freedesktop.org runtime.\n  This makes it smaller - about 7 MiB to download, and 40 MiB installed - but\n  you can't use the latest Python features in your code.\n- ``py27`` uses Python 2.7. It is a similar size to the Python 3.4 base app.\n\nFlatpak applications use a *runtime*, a bundle of common libraries and\nexecutables. If your application is the first a user installs with a given\nruntime, Flatpak will download the runtime as well. Hopefully most apps will\nshare a few runtimes, so that installation is quick and easy.\n",
