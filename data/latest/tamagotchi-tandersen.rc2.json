    "description": "# Tamagotchi-challenge\nA PyGame implementation of the Tamagotchi challenge\n\n## Installation instructions\n\nMake sure to have `python3.6` installed with the pip package installer.\n\nThis is due to the limitations of pygame, it will fail to install for python3.8.\n\nYou may also like to create a virtual environment to run it but it is not necessary.\n\n`pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt`\n\n## Running tests\n\nFrom the base of the Tamagotchi Challenge directory, you can run\n\n`python3.6 setup.py test`\n\nThis will run all the available unit tests and will make sure the correct packages are accessible.\n\n## Running the game\n\nFor quick play, you can install the package from pypi\n\n`pip3.6 install tamagotchi_tandersen`\n\n`python3.6 -m tamagotchi_tandersen`\n\nRun in console if you have the code\n\n`python3.6 setup.py install`\n\n`python3.6 -m tamagotchi`\n\n## Docker\n\nParsing in the display to docker is not available to MacOS due to restrictions on the\nsandbox. For linux it is currently under development.\n\n## Controls\n\nThe user driven interactions with the pet is done through the keyboard.\n\nThere is a list of available foods on the bottom right hand corner that \nyou may cycle through by pressing either the `left arrow key` or \n`right arrow key`.\n\nThe food showing in the box can be feed to the pet by pressing `e`.\nOver-eating can fill the pets stomach and it will alleviate itself.\n\nThere are two gauges to view, the health and energy bar, the energy\nbar will go redder and the pet will go to sleep. You may pre-empt an\nautomatic sleep by telling the pet to go to sleep by pressing `s`. The\nhealth bar is recovered by eating food, and each type of food impacts\nthe pets health and fullness differently. Beware no health will cause\nthe pet to pass away.\n\nThe pet will age as time progresses, growing older which can be seen\nby the change in art. Unfortunately as time goes on, the pet will\npass away and that will finish the game with the player having\nsuccessfully raised a pet having not neglected it.\n\n## Aim of the game\n\nYou should try your best to take care of the pet by feeding it when\nit gets hungry and drops health. Beware if it gets tired and goes to\nsleep you may find yourself unable to feed your pet. Managing these\nalong with a limited food set, and other possible hindrances to feeding\nyour pet are the key to giving your pet the best longevity.\n\n## Future development\n\nThe game board could be constructed by a factory, that will handle\nproducing the food inventory, the actor - pet etc.\n\nUnifying food inventory and status bars under UI elements for the\npurpose of drawing.\n\nNeed to fix up naming with the StatusBarFactory with StatusElement.\n\nAn actor factory that can create NPC actors, and extending the Actor\nabstract class to include an interaction function that can take in\nother actors in the game. From there we can extend to look at state\nretained interactions from simple, 'Nice to see you again' to a\nfriendship tracker.\n\nExtending OO design, random chance special food items like a golden apple \ncould be implemented via decorators. The pet could be a singleton to \nensure only one pet actually exists.\n\n## Credit\n\nI did not create any of the pixel art used and was taken from the web. Credit\nto those who spent their time creating these pieces of art. These works are\nnot being used for the purpose of commercial use.",
