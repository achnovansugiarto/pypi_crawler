    "description": "****************\nedrn.nyuxls2erne\n****************\n\n.. contents::\n\nThis is a converter.  It takes specimen records from New York University\nMedical School (NYU_)'s cancer research specimen collection that are stored as\na series of spreadsheets.  From those, it outputs a series of SQL statements\nthat can be injected into the cache system of the Early Detection Research\nNetwork (EDRN_) Resource Network Exchange (ERNE_).\n\nThat lets the EDRN public portal show the specimens collected at NYU, without\nrequiring an ERNE server to be installed at NYU.\n\nNifty, huh?\n\n..

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n    U.S. Government sponsorship acknowledged.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis package has no external requirements (aside from Python >=2.4 <3.0).\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBy far, the easiest way to install the NYU XLS to ERNE Converter is to use\npip_ or easy_install_.  As a privileged user, type::\n\n    pip install edrn.nyuxls2erne\n\nor::\n\n    easy_install edrn.nyuxls2erne\n\nThe software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed\nautomatically.\n\nAre you an advanced user who takes advantage of virtualenv_ or buildout_?  You\nknow what to do.\n\n\nInstalling from Source\n----------------------\n\nIf neither pip nor easy_install are available on your system, just install\nfrom source:\n\n1.  Download the source package archive.\n2.  Extract the gzip'd tar archive.\n3.  In the extracted directory, run ``python setup.py install`` as a\n    privileged user.\n\n\n\n..
