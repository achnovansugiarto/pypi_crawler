    "description": "===============\nPandarus_remote\n===============\n\nPandarus_remote is a web service for processing and managing data for regionalized life cycle assessment using `pandarus <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandarus>`__. It is meant to be used by the `brightway2-regional <https://brightway2-regional.readthedocs.io/>`__ library.\n\n.. contents::\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``pandarus_remote`` can be installed using pip, but your life will be much easier if you use ``conda`` to get consistent dependencies:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    conda config --add channels conda-forge\n    conda config --add channels cmutel\n    conda create -n pandarus python=3.9\n    conda activate pandarus\n    conda install pandarus_remote\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n``pandarus_remote`` requires the following Python libraries:\n\n* `appdirs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs>`__\n* `docopt <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docopt>`__\n* `fiona <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona>`__\n* `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`__\n* `pandarus <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandarus>`__\n* `peewee <http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/>`__\n* `redis <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis>`__\n* `rasterio <https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio>`__\n* `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`__\n* `rq <http://python-rq.org/>`__\n\nIn addition, ``pandarus_remote`` requires that `Redis <https://redis.io/>`__ be installed.\n\nRunning the web service\n=======================\n\nA Redis server must be running on the local machine.\n\nA worker process for ``rq`` should be started with the command ``rq worker``.\n\nFinally, run the ``flask`` application any way you want. For example, to run the test server (not in production!), do:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    export FLASK_APP=/path/to/pandarus_remote/__init__.py\n    flask run\n\nEnvironment variables\n---------------------\n\nThe following environment variables can be used to configure ``pandarus_remote``:\n\n* ``PANDARUS_EXPORT_FORMAT``: A string specifying the Fiona driver to use, like \"GPKG\" or \"GeoJSON\"\n* ``PANDARUS_CPUS``: The number of CPUs to use when performing intersection calculations\n\nAPI endpoints\n=============\n\nThe following API endpoints are supported:\n\n/\n-\n\nPing the server. Returns something like ``pandarus_remote web service, version (1, 0)``.\n\nHTTP method: **GET**\n\n/catalog\n--------\n\nGet the list of spatial datasets and results currently available on the server.\n\nHTTP method: **GET**\n\nResponse\n````````\n\n* 200: Return a JSON payload of the form:\n\n.. code-block:: javascript\n\n    [\n        'files': [\n            ('file name', 'hex-encoded sha256 hash of file contents', 'type of file')\n        ],\n        'intersections': [\n            ('input file 1 sha256 hash', 'input file 2 sha256 hash')\n        ],\n        'remaining': [\n            ('input file 1 sha256 hash', 'input file 2 sha256 hash')\n        ],\n        'rasterstats': [\n            ('vector file sha256 hash', 'raster file sha256 hash')\n        ]\n    ]\n\n/upload\n-------\n\nUpload a spatial data file.
