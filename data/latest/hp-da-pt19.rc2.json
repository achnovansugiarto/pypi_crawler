    "description": "# Drona Aviation Pluto Drone Swarm Challenge\n\n- Click here to read the problem statement [High_Drona.pdf](High_Drona.pdf)\n- Click here to read the report[Report_Task_1&2.pdf]()\n\n\n Python wrapper for intraction with official Pluto Drone's firmware API. This package has following features:\n\n**Task-1**\n\n- [x] Implementation of control commands for the drone movements.(such as Pitch forward, Roll\nleft, take off - Land, etc.)\n\n**Task-2**\n\n- [x] Overhead camera calibration method\n- [x] ArUCo tag detection and tracking\n- [x] Pose estimation of the ArUCo tag\n- [x] Implementation of PID for controlling drone\n- [x] Drone Hovering\n- [x] Drone movement in a rectangle of (1x2 meter)\n\n**Task-3**\n\n- [ ] Drone Swarming in a rectangle of(1x2 meter)  \n\n## Installation Using pip\n```\npip install hp-da-pt19\n```\nFor Linux distributions with both python2 and python3 (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...) you need to run\n\n```\npip3 install hp-da-pt19\n```\n\n## Installation in Developer Mode\nUsing the commands below you can install the repository in developer mode. This allows you to modify the library and use the modified version regularly.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/da-vidi21/HP_DA_PT19.git\ncd HP_DA_PT19\npip install -e .\n```\n## Approach \n![approach](Images/Flowchart.png)\n## File Description\n- **[calibration.py](hp_da_pt19/calibration.py)** :This file contains the code necessary for calibrating our camera. This step has several pre-requisites. we need to have a folder containing a set of checkerboard images taken using our camera. We have to make sure that these checkerboard images are of different poses and orientation. We need to provide the path to this directory and the size of the square in metres. We can also change the shape of the checkerboard pattern using the parameters given. We also have to make sure this matches with our checkerboard pattern. This code will generate two numpy files `calibration_matrix.npy` and `distortion_coefficients.npy`. These files are required to execute the next step that involves pose estimation. Note that the calibration and distortion numpy files given in this repository camera and its position specific.\n\n    ```\n    def calibrate(cam_src, frame_count, square_size, width, height, visualize=False):\n    ```\n    - Determines the camera matrix and the distortion coefficients from the image points.\n\n\n\n- **[arucoTracking.py](hp_da_pt19/arucoTracking.py)** : This file contains the code that performs pose estimation and tracking after detecting the ArUCo markers. This is done in real-time for each frame obtained from the camera feed. We need to specify the path to the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients obtained from the previous step as well as the type for ArUCo marker we want to detect.\nIn our case we have used 4X4 ArUCo tag Dictionary.\n\n\n    ```\n    def start(self): \n    ```\n    -
