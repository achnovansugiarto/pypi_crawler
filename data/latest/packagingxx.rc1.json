Then run `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to generate\ndistribution files. Check _build_ to verify if all modules and files needed for the distribution are included.\n\nBoth distributions have _egg_ and _dist_ directory. Though files inside _egg_ are the same, distribution via `sdist` is\na tar file, while that via `bdist_wheel` is a wheel file. Moreover, the wheel one includes _build_ directory.\n\nNote that previous generated distribution would exist, so manual removal may be needed.\n\n### Local\n\nTo quickly test whether the configuration of \"setup.py\" is correct, simply run `pip install -e .` under this root\nproject directory.\n\nTo install extra needed packages specified, run `pip install \".[extra]\"` (double quote is recommended in case some\nother shells like zsh fail to recognize).\n\n### Remote\n\n#### Upload\n\nNormally, file \"$HOME/.pypirc\" would be used to define the configuration. Below is the\nusual format:\n\n```\n[distutils]\n  index-servers =\n    default-repo\n    testing-repo\n\n[default-repo]\n  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/\n  username = {username}\n  password = {password}\n\n[testing-repo]\n  repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n  username = {username}\n  password = {password}\n```\n\nBe cautious that \"[distutils]\" is mandatory for uploading to repository.\n\nLooks like the API token mechanism in both official \"pypi\" repo are not working as expected,\nthe password should use the actual password since API token doesn't work.\n\n\nWhen the configuration is done, command `python setup.py bdist_wheel upload -r default-repo`\nwould build the distribution and upload to the specified repo directly.\n\nHowever, it's recommended to apply `twine` to take of the uploading. After the distribution\nis generated, run `python -m twine upload --repository {repo} dist/*` to upload. For this\nway, the process of distribution generation and uploading are separate, which is more manageable.\n\n#### Download\n\nSimilar to the uploading, file \"$HOME/.pip/pip.conf\" is the one for downloading configuration:\n\n```\n[global]\n  index-url =\n    https://pypi.org/simple/\n\n[install]\n  index-url = https://test.pypi.org/simple/\n  extra-index-url =\n    {repo_1}\n    {repo_2}\n```\n\nWhen it comes to download a package from a repo, it's worth to mention that there is certain\nconfig precedence (command line > environment variable > configuration in \"\"). In that\ncase, `pip install` would look for the configuration following the precedence to download and install\nthe package specified.\n\nSo be aware of there is no environment variables like `PIP_INDEX_URL` or `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` if you\nwant the configuration file to take effect.\n\nAs long as the package is uploaded and the downloading configuration is properly set, then simply run\n`pip install \"{package[extra]}\"` would do the work. Otherwise, run `pip install --index-url {repo} {package}` to\nensure the repo is correct.\n\n\n## Demo\n\nRun codes below for demo to see if the package is function:\n\n```py\nimport caller as demo\nfrom caller import Fruit\n\ndemo.entry.main()\n\nfruit = Fruit()\nfruit.printing()\n```\n\n\n## Reference\n\n- Packaging Python Projects: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/\n- Including Data Files: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#including-data-files\n- The .pypirc file: https://packaging.python.org/specifications/pypirc/\n- PIP Config Precedence: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#config-precedence\n- Keywords in setuptools: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html\n- Metadata for Python Software Packages: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0314\n- Specifying package versions: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#understanding-your-error-message\n\n\n",
