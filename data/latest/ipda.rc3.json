    "description": "**************\n IPDA Library\n**************\n\n.. contents::\n\nThe International Planetary Data Alliance (IPDA_) supports cross-institution\ndata search, data discover, data retrieval, etc.  It uses the Agile OODT (Object\nOriented Data Technology) library to handle profile metadata search/retrieval\nand product search/retrieval. It also provides utilities to create, manipulate,\nand serialize VOTables_.\n\n.. References:\n.. _IPDA: http://planetarydata.org/\n.. _VOTables: http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/VOT.html\n\nInstallation\n************\n\nThis document tells you how to install the IPDA Library.\n\n\nQuick Instructions\n==================\n\nAs a user with administrative privileges, run::\n\n    easy_install ipda\n\nThat's it.\n\n\nFull Instructions\n=================\n\nThe IPDA Library requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend\nversion 2.4 or later.  As of this writing, 2.6 is the latest stable version.\nIf Python is not yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and\nsource distributions from the Python website.\n\nTo test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::\n\n    python -V\n    \nYou should see output similar to::\n\n    Python 2.6\n    \nindicating the version of Python installed.  The IPDA Library also requires\n`Agile OODT`_.  OODT_ is Object Oriented Data Technology, a framework for\nmetadata and data grids.  Agile OODT is a Python version of OODT that supports\nhigher performance and easier integration than the Java_ version.\n\nBy far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install the IPDA\nLibrary is to use EasyInstall_.  If your Python installation has EasyInstall\navailable to it, then this one command is all you need to run in order to\ndownload, build, install, and generate command-line tools all in one go for\nall users on your system::\n\n    easy_install ipda\n    \nBe sure to run that command as an administrative user.  For example, on Mac OS\nX and other Unix systems, you might need to run::\n\n    sudo easy_install ipda\n\nThat will also download and install all dependencies, including Agile OODT.\n\n\nExecutables\n-----------\n\nThere are currently no executables within the IPDA Library at this time.  It\nsolely provides VOTable_ and PDAP_ functions.\n\n\nInstalling EasyInstall\n----------------------\n\nIf you happen to be on a system where your Python installation lacks easy\ninstall, worry not!  Upgrading your system to gain EasyInstall's abilities is\nquite simple.  Follow these instructions:\n\n1.  Download http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py\n2.  As an administrative user, run the freshly-downloaded ez_setup.py file\n    using your system's Python.\n\nEasyInstall and its necessary libraries will be downloaded, built, and\ninstalled for you, and the ``easy_install`` executable generated.  The\nlocation of the ``easy_install`` executable is in your platform's standard\nlocation for Python scripts, and is usually where the ``python`` executable is\nitself.  For example, on Mac OS X_ 10.5, the directory is::\n\n    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin\n\n\nInstalling Without EasyInstall\n------------------------------\n\nIf EasyInstall is not available on your system, you can still make a proper\ninstallation of the IPDA Library. Follow these instructions:\n\n1.  Download the Agile OODT source distribution from\n    http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/dist/agile-oodt/oodt-0.0.1.tar.gz.\n    Substitute version numbers as appropriate.\n2.  Download the IPDA Library source distribution from\n    http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/dist/ipda-library/ipda-0.0.1.tar.gz.\n    Substitute version numbers as appropriate.\n3.  Unpack each archive.\n4.  Change the current working directory to each newly-created subdirectory,\n    ``oodt-0.0.1`` and ``ipda-0.0.1``, again substituting version\n    numbers as appropriate.\n5.  As an administrative user, run:  ``python setup.py install`` in each\n    subdirectory.\n\n\nIssues and Questions\n====================\n\nTo report any problems with or ask for help about the IPDA Library, visit our\ncontact_ web page.\n\n\n..

This release updates the unit tests to\ncheck for that, and repairs the problem.\n\n\n0.0.2 - Bug Fix\n===============\n\nThis release addresses the special case of the handling of the PDS resource\nclass \"dataset\" to the PDAP resource class \"DATA_SET\" (with an underscore).\nIt now properly adds the underscore.\n\n\n0.0.1 - FCS\n===========\n\nFirst customer ship includes PDS-to-PDAP query capabilities.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Unreleased\n==================\n\nThis is an initial proof-of-Python implementation that provides minimal\nfunction of:\n\n* VOTables in Python\n* GRS data access",
