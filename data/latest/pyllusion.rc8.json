These two parameters can be\nmodulated to independently impact either the objective difference of the\ncore components of the illusion (e.g., the difference between the two\nsegments in the [Müller-Lyer](#müller-lyer-illusion-illusion) illusion)\nor the intensity of the illusion effect (e.g., the angle of the\n“distractors” arrows).\n\nDescribing illusions using a set of parameters aims at fostering\n**reproducible science**, allowing neuroscientists to easily report,\ngenerate and manipulate similar stimuli regardless of the display format\nand software.\n\n## Installation\n\n    pip install https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion/zipball/master\n\nYou can also find the installation instructions for Python 3\n[here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).\n\n## Contribution\n\nYou have some ideas? Want to improve things, add new illusions, and help\nus shake people’s brain? Let us know, we would be very happy to have you\non board :relaxed:.\n\n## Share Your Data\n\nIf you have used **Pyllusion** in your experiments, and have made your\nscripts and data open access, feel free to also reference the link to\nyour data by opening [an\nissue](https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion/issues) with the\n**Experiment Report** template.\n\n## Citation\n\nYou can cite the package as follows:\n\n- Makowski, D., Lau, Z. J., Pham, T., Paul Boyce, W., & Annabel Chen, S. H. (2021). [A Parametric Framework to Generate Visual Illusions Using Python](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03010066211057347). Perception, 50(11), 950-965.\n\n## Features\n\n### Delboeuf Illusion\n\nThe **[Delboeuf\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delboeuf_illusion)** is an\noptical illusion of relative size perception, where circles of identical\nsize appear as different because of their surrounding context. The\nillusion was named for the Belgian philosopher, mathematician,\nexperimental psychologist, hypnotist, and psychophysicist Joseph Remi\nLeopold Delboeuf (1831–1896), who created it in 1865.\n\n``` python\nimport pyllusion\n\ndelboeuf = pyllusion.Delboeuf(illusion_strength=3)\ndelboeuf.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_delboeuf1.png)\n\n### Ebbinghaus Illusion\n\nThe **[Ebbinghaus\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion)** is an\noptical illusion of relative size perception, where circles of identical\nsize appear as different because of their surrounding context (the right\nred circle appears as smaller because its surrounding circle is larger).\nThe illusion was named after its creator the German psychologist Hermann\nEbbinghaus (1850–1909), though it got popularized by Edward B. Titchener\nin a 1901 textbook of experimental psychology.\n\nThe Ebbinghaus illusion is considered a high-level integration illusion\n(King et al., 2017) which has been considered relatively unaffected\namongst schizophrenics (as compared to healthy controls), who have\nproblems in contextual processing of visual stimuli. Specifically,\ngreater disorganized schizophrenia symptoms are related to a higher\nresistance towards the Ebbinghaus illusion (Uhlhaas et al., 2006).\nReduced sensitivity of schizophrenics to this illusion has been used to\nreflect how prior knowledge influences perceptual organization to a\nlesser extent, i.e., reduced top-down influence, in schizophrenia\n(Silverstein & Keane, 2011).\n\n``` python\nebbinghaus = pyllusion.Ebbinghaus(illusion_strength=2)\nebbinghaus.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_ebbinghaus1.png)\n\n### Müller-Lyer Illusion\n\nThe **[Müller-Lyer\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion)** is\nan optical illusion causing the participant to perceive two segments as\nbeing of different length depending on the shape of the arrows. The\nillusion was named after its creator the erman sociologist Franz Carl\nMüller-Lyer (1857–1916) in 1889.\n\nThe Müller-Lyer illusion is a high-level integration illusion requiring\ncontextual processing by the brain (King et al., 2017). The effect of\nthis illusion in schizophrenics appears to be more mixed, with some\nstudies finding greater resistance to it (e.g., Parnas et al., 2001) and\nothers showing increased susceptibility (e.g., Kantrowitz et al., 2009).\nThere is some evidence that susceptibility to the Müller-Lyer illusion\nis negatively correlated with autistic traits in the typical population\n(but not with the Ebbinghaus nor the Ponzo illusion) (Chouinard et al.,\n2013).\n\n``` python\nmullerlyer = pyllusion.MullerLyer(illusion_strength=30)\nmullerlyer.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_mullerlyer1.png)\n\n### Ponzo Illusion\n\nThe **[Ponzo illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzo_illusion)**\nis an optical illusion of relative size perception, where horizontal\nlines of identical size appear as different because of their surrounding\ncontext (the top line appear as longer, as it is interepreted as being\nin the distance). The illusion was named after its creator the Italian\npsychologist Mario Ponzo (1882–1960) in 1911, who suggested that the\nhuman mind judges an object’s size based on its background.\n\nPonzo illusion is considered a high-level integration illusion as it is\ncognitively demanding in the sense that depth cues have to be correctly\ninterpreted to signal changes in visual distance (King et al., 2017),\nrequiring higher-level cortical processes (Song et al., 2011). Similar\nto the Ebbinghaus illusion, it is also shown to have less effect in\nbiasing perception in schizophrenic subjects (Kantrowitz et al., 2009).\n\n``` python\nponzo = pyllusion.Ponzo(illusion_strength=20)\nponzo.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_ponzo1.png)\n\n### Vertical–horizontal Illusion\n\nThe **[vertical–horizontal\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical%E2%80%93horizontal_illusion)**\nillustrates the tendency for observers to overestimate the length of a\nvertical line relative to a horizontal line of the same length (Shipley\net al., 1949).\n\n``` python\nverticalhorizontal = pyllusion.VerticalHorizontal(illusion_strength=-90)\nverticalhorizontal.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_verticalhorizontal1.png)\n\n### Zöllner Illusion\n\nThe **[Zöllner\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%B6llner_illusion)** is an\noptical illusion, where horizontal lines are perceived as not parallel\nbecause of their background. It is named after its discoverer, the\nGerman astrophysicist Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner in 1860.\n\n``` python\nzollner = pyllusion.Zollner(illusion_strength=75)\nzollner.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_zollner1.png)\n\n### Rod and Frame Illusion\n\nThe **[Rod and frame\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_and_frame_test#Rod_and_frame_illusion)**\nis an optical illusion causing the participant to perceive the rod to be\noriented congruent with the orientation of the frame.\n\n``` python\nrodframe = pyllusion.RodFrame(illusion_strength=-11)\nrodframe.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_rodframe1.png)\n\n### Poggendorff Illusion\n\nThe **[Poggendorff\nillusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggendorff_illusion)** is an\noptical illusion that involves the misperception of the position of one\nsegment of a transverse line that has been interrupted by the contour of\nan intervening structure. It is named after Johann Christian Poggendorff\nwho discovered in Zöllner’s illusion after 1860. The magnitude of the\nillusion depends on the properties of the obscuring pattern and the\nnature of its borders.\n\n``` python\npoggendorff = pyllusion.Poggendorff(illusion_strength=-50)\npoggendorff.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_poggendorff1.png)\n\n### Simultaneous Contrast illusion\n\nA neutral gray target will appear lighter or darker than it does in\nisolation when compared to, respectively, a dark gray or light gray\ntarget. **[Simultaneous\ncontrast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect)**, identified\nby Michel Eugène Chevreul, refers to the manner in which the colors of\ntwo different objects affect each other.\n\nIn the image here, the two inner rectangles are exactly the same shade\nof grey, but the upper one appears to be a lighter grey than the lower\none due to the background provided by the outer rectangles.\n\n``` python\ncontrast = pyllusion.Contrast(illusion_strength=-50)\ncontrast.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_contrast1.png)\n\n### White Illusion\n\n**[White’s illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%27s_illusion)**\nis a brightness illusion in which rectangles of the same grey color are\nperceived of different luminance depending on their background.\n\n``` python\nwhite = pyllusion.White(illusion_strength=100)\nwhite.to_image()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_white1.png)\n\n<!-- ### Chubb illusion -->\n\n<!-- The **[Chubb illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chubb_illusion)** is an optical illusion or error in visual perception in which the apparent contrast of an object varies substantially to most viewers depending on its relative contrast to the field on which it is displayed. -->\n\n<!-- ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EH2_hl1xbE4/TxNmsYaQ5uI/AAAAAAAAEUE/ZqdI5414b1I/s280/chubbillusion.gif) -->\n\n<!-- - **TO DO** *(consider helping!)* -->\n\n### Kanizsa Square\n\nThe **Kanizsa Square** is an [illusory\ncontour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours) illusion. See\n[Keane et\nal., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6667222/).\n\nSome studies have tested the effect of the Kanizsa Square in individuals\nwith schizophrenia, but the finding of greater resistance to the\nillusion is not robust (King et al., 2017).\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ken_Manktelow/publication/6821211/figure/fig2/AS:277716826902534@1443224259391/Kanizsa-square-An-illusory-figure-induced-by-edges-showing-an-illusory-contour-and-an.png)\n\n  - **TO DO** *(consider helping\\!)*\n\n### Autostereograms\n\n**[Autostereograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram)** are\nimages made of a pattern that is horizontally repeated (with slight\nvariations) which, when watched with the appropriate focus, will\ngenerate an illusion of depth.\n\nFor instance, in the image below, the `autostereogram` automatically\nadds a guide (you can disable it by setting `guide=False`), the two red\ndots. Look at them and relax your eyes until you see a new red dot\nbetween them two. Then, try focusing on this new red dot until it gets\nvery sharp and until your eyes stabilize. You should then be able to\nperceive the letters **3D** as carved in the figure\n\nIt can take a bit of time to “get there”, but once you are used to it,\nit’s a mind-blowing experience 🤯\n\n    autostereograms = pyllusion.Autostereogram(stimulus=\"3D\", width=1600, height=900)\n    autostereograms.draw()\n\n<!-- ```{python message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE} -->\n\n<!-- img = pyllusion.autostereogram(stimulus=\"3D\", width=1600, height=900) -->\n\n<!-- img.save(\"docs/img/README_autostereogram1.png\") -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n![](docs/img/README_autostereogram1.png)\n\nThe function is highly customisable, and we can use a black and white\nimage as a **depth mask** (in this case, the [picture of a\nskull](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/Pyllusion/docs/img/depthmask.png)\nthat you will see as emerging from the background), and customise the\npattern used by providing another function (here, the `image_circles()`\nfunction to which we can provide additional arguments like `blackwhite`,\nthe number of circles `n`, their size range and their transparency with\n`alpha`).\n\n![](docs/img/depthmask.png)\n\n    autostereograms = pyllusion.Autostereogram(stimulus=\"docs/img/depthmask.png\",\n                       pattern=pyllusion.image_circles,\n                       color=\"blackwhite\",\n                       alpha=0.75,\n                       size_min=0.005,\n                       size_max=0.03,\n                       n=1000)\n    autostereograms.draw()\n\n<!-- ```{python message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE} -->\n\n<!-- img = pyllusion.autostereogram(stimulus=\"docs/img/depthmask.png\", -->\n\n<!--                    pattern=pyllusion.image_circles, -->\n\n<!--                    color=\"blackwhite\", -->\n\n<!--                    alpha=0.75, -->\n\n<!--                    size_min=0.005, -->\n\n<!--                    size_max=0.03, -->\n\n<!--                    n=1000) -->\n\n<!-- img.save(\"docs/img/README_autostereogram2.png\") -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n![](docs/img/README_autostereogram2.png)\n\n### Pareidolia\n\nPareidolia is the tendency to incorrectly perceive of a stimulus as an\nobject pattern or meaning known to the observer. [Liu et\nal. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3980010/?mod=article_inline),\nin their study *“Seeing Jesus in toast”*, famously (the study got\nawarded an Ignobel prize) investigated the correlates of face pareidolia\nby blending images of faces with noise-like images.\n\nBlending of images can be achieved: as followed\n\n``` python\npareidolia = pyllusion.Pareidolia(pattern=\"docs/img/snake.png\", \n                                 n=[20, 300, 4000], \n                                 sd=[4, 2, 1], \n                                 weight=[3, 2, 1],\n                                 alpha=80,\n                                 blur=0.5)\npareidolia.draw()\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_pareidolia.png)\n\n### Transparency From Motion (TFM)\n\nIn visual perception, the **[kinetic depth\neffect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_depth_effect)** refers to\nthe phenomenon whereby the three-dimensional structural form of an\nobject can be perceived when the object is moving (Wallach & O’Connell,\n1953; [Mamassian &\nWallace, 2010](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191769)).\nOne of its derivative is the **Transparency-From-Motion** illusion,\nconsisting in the superposition of two dot clouds moving in different\ndirections that results in the perception of two transparent layers (See\n;\n[Schütz, 2014](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193903);\n[Wexler et\nal., 2015](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/48/14990.full.pdf);\n[Schütz &\nMamassian, 2016](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2548036)\nand <http://lab-perception.org/demo/p/tfm> for a demo).\n\n``` python\nparameters = pyllusion.motiontransparency_parameters(angle=45)\nimages = pyllusion.motiontransparency_images(parameters)\n\npyllusion.images_to_gif(images, path=\"Transparency_From_Motion.gif\", fps=parameters[\"FPS\"])\n```\n\n![](docs/img/README_TFM1.gif)\n\n<!-- ### Pattern Detection in Motion  -->\n\n<!-- - **TO DO** *(consider helping!)* -->\n\n### Pinna illusion\n\nSee also **[Zeljic et\nal., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584620303717)**.\n\n  - **TO DO** *(consider helping\\!)*\n\n![](http://psychedelic-information-theory.com/upload/img/pinna-illusion-image.jpg)\n\n### Monnier-Shevell illusion\n\nSee also [David Novick’s](https://twitter.com/NovickProf) tweets\n[**here**](https://twitter.com/NovickProf/status/1348653264645009408),\nand\n[**here**](https://twitter.com/NovickProf/status/1358787676326031360).\n\n  - **TO DO** *(consider helping\\!)*\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Erdge3AXIAcisZj.png)\n\n<!-- ### Exctinction illusion -->\n\n<!-- See also [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AkiyoshiKitaoka/status/1351867885493211138/photo/1 by Akiyoshi Kitaoka). -->\n\n<!-- - **TO DO** *(consider helping!)* -->\n\n<!-- ![](docs/img/extinction_illusion.png) -->\n\n## PsychoPy Integration\n\nPyllusion can be easily integrated into\n[PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) for running experiments as well\\!\n\n    # Load packages\n    import pyllusion\n    from psychopy import visual, event\n    \n    # Create parameters\n    delboeuf = pyllusion.Delboeuf(illusion_strength=1, difference=2)\n    \n    # Initiate Window\n    window = visual.Window(size=[1920, 1080], winType='pygame',\n                           color='white', fullscr=False)\n    \n    # Display illusion\n    delboeuf.to_psychopy(window)\n    \n    # Refresh and close window\n    window.flip()\n    event.waitKeys()  # Press any key to close\n    window.close()\n\n![](docs/img/image_example.gif)\n\n## References\n\nBertamini, M.
