CMake modules\ntypically consist of one or more functions (or macros) written in the CMake\nlanguage. In an effort to treat infrastructure as code, we need to be able to\ngenerate API documentation for these CMake modules. CMinx addresses this need\nby generating reStructuredText files from documented CMake modules. Since CMinx\nunderstands the grammar of the CMake language, these comments only need to focus\non describing the code and not duplicating it.\n\n*************************\nInstallation Instructions\n*************************\n\nThe easiest way to install CMinx is via ``pip``. Simply run:\n\n.. code:: .py\n\n   pip install CMinx\n\n\nCMinx can also easily be used as part of a CMake workflow by adding:\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n   include(FetchContent)\n   FetchContent_Declare(\n       cminx\n       GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/cmakepp/cminx.git\n   )\n   FetchContent_MakeAvailable(cminx)\n   cminx_gen_rst(\"${input_dir}\" \"${output_dir}\")\n\nto your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. More detailed instructions, can be found\n`here <https://cmakepp.github.io/CMinx/installation.html>`__.\n\n\n*************\nExample Usage\n*************\n\nTo use CMinx, first document your CMake modules like:\n\n.. code:: cmake\n\n   #[[[\n   # A brief description.\n   #\n   # A more detailed description, must be separated from the brief by at least\n   # one blank line.\n   #\n   # :param param0: The 0-th parameter passed to the function\n   #]]\n   function(example param0)\n       message(\"This function says: ${param0}\")\n   endfunction()\n\nThe documentation resides in a normal CMake block comment aside from the fact\nthat the block comment starts with an extra ``[`` character. The body of the\nblock comment is extracted into the reStructuredText file more or less verbatim\nso reStructuredText markup can be used within the comment for more formatting\noptions. Assuming the above CMake module lives in ``example.cmake``, the\nAPI documentation is generated by running:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   foo@bar:~$ cminx example.cmake\n\nWhich will generate:\n\n.. code:: reStructuredText\n\n   #######\n   example\n   #######\n\n   .. module:: example\n\n\n   .. function:: example(param0)\n\n      A brief description.\n\n      A more detailed description, must be separated from the brief by at least\n      one blank line.\n\n      :param param0: The 0-th parameter passed to the function\n\nSee `here <https://cmakepp.github.io/CMinx/documenting/index.html>`__ for more\ndetailed usage instructions.\n\n\n*****************\nAPI Documentation\n*****************\n\nFull API documentation can be found\n`here <https://cmakepp.github.io/CMinx/developer/api.html>`__.\n\n************\nContributing\n************\n\nIn short, we try to be a welcoming community. If you have questions,\nsuggestions, bug reports, *etc.* open an issue and we will address them\nas soon as possible. If you want to contribute code, that's even better. We\nrecommend you start a draft PR early in the process so we know the contribution\nis coming and can help you along the way.\n\nCMinx is part of the CMakePP organization, whose contributing guidelines can be\nfound `here <https://github.com/CMakePP/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.\n",
