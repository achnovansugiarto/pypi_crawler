The SDV uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn\npatterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.\n\n## Features\n:brain: **Create synthetic data using machine learning.** The SDV offers multiple models, ranging\nfrom classical statistical methods (GaussianCopula) to deep learning methods (CTGAN). Generate\ndata for single tables, multiple connected tables or sequential tables.\n\n:bar_chart: **Evaluate and visualize data.** Compare the synthetic data to the real data against a\nvariety of measures. Diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.\n\n:arrows_counterclockwise: **Preprocess, anonymize and define constraints.** Control data\nprocessing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization\nand define business rules in the form of logical constraints.\n\n| Important Links                               |                                                                                                     |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [![][Colab Logo] **Tutorials**][Tutorials]    | Get some hands-on experience with the SDV.

We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with\nother software on your device.\n\n```bash\npip install sdv\n```\n\n```bash\nconda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge sdv\n```\n\n# Getting Started\nLoad a demo dataset to get started. This dataset is a single table describing guests staying at a\nfictional hotel.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.datasets.demo import download_demo\n\nreal_data, metadata = download_demo(\n    modality='single_table',\n    dataset_name='fake_hotel_guests')\n```\n\n![Single Table Metadata Example](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/master/docs/images/Single-Table-Metadata-Example.png)\n\nThe demo also includes **metadata**, a description of the dataset, including the data types in each\ncolumn and the primary key (`guest_email`).\n\n## Synthesizing Data\nNext, we can create an **SDV synthesizer**,  an object that you can use to create synthetic data.\nIt learns patterns from the real data and replicates them to generate synthetic data. Let's use\nthe `FAST_ML` preset synthesizer, which is optimized for performance.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.lite import SingleTablePreset\n\nsynthesizer = SingleTablePreset(metadata, name='FAST_ML')\nsynthesizer.fit(data=real_data)\n```\n\nAnd now the synthesizer is ready to create synthetic data!\n\n```python\nsynthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=500)\n```\n\nThe synthetic data will have the following properties:\n- **Sensitive columns are fully anonymized.** The email, billing address and credit card number\ncolumns contain new data so you don't expose the real values.\n- **Other columns follow statistical patterns.** For example, the proportion of room types, the\ndistribution of check in dates and the correlations between room rate and room type are preserved.\n- **Keys and other relationships are intact.** The primary key (guest email) is unique for each row.\nIf you have multiple tables, the connection between a primary and foreign keys makes sense.\n\n## Evaluating Synthetic Data\nThe SDV library allows you to evaluate the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data. Get\nstarted by generating a quality report.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.evaluation.single_table import evaluate_quality\n\nquality_report = evaluate_quality(\n    real_data,\n    synthetic_data,\n    metadata)\n```\n\n```\nCreating report: 100%|██████████| 4/4 [00:00<00:00, 19.30it/s]\nOverall Quality Score: 89.12%\nProperties:\nColumn Shapes: 90.27%\nColumn Pair Trends: 87.97%\n```\n\nThis object computes an overall quality score on a scale of 0 to 100% (100 being the best) as well\nas detailed breakdowns. For more insights, you can also visualize the synthetic vs. real data.\n\n```python\nfrom sdv.evaluation.single_table import get_column_plot\n\nfig = get_column_plot(\n    real_data=real_data,\n    synthetic_data=synthetic_data,\n    column_name='amenities_fee',\n    metadata=metadata\n)\n    \nfig.show()\n```\n\n![Real vs. Synthetic Data](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/master/docs/images/Real-vs-Synthetic-Evaluation.png)\n\n# What's Next?\nUsing the SDV library, you can synthesize single table, multi table and sequential data. You can\nalso customize the full synthetic data workflow, including preprocessing, anonymization and adding\nconstraints.\n\nTo learn more, visit the [SDV Demo page](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/demos).\n\n# Credits\nThank you to our team of contributors who have built and maintained the SDV ecosystem over the\nyears!\n\n[View Contributors](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Citation\nIf you use SDV for your research, please cite the following paper:\n\n*Neha Patki, Roy Wedge, Kalyan Veeramachaneni*.

After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we\ncreated [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.\nToday, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for\nsynthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic\ndata, including:\n\n* 🔄 Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.\n* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,\n  multi table and time series data.\n* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data\n  generation models.\n\n[Get started using the SDV package](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) -- a fully\nintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries\nfor specific needs.\n\n\n# Release Notes\n\n## 1.0.0 - 2023-03-28\n\nThis is a major release that introduces a new API to the `SDV` aimed at streamlining the process of synthetic data generation! To achieve this, this release includes the addition of several large features.\n\n### Metadata\n\nSome of the most notable additions are the new `SingleTableMetadata` and `MultiTableMetadata` classes. These classes enable a number of features that make it easier to synthesize your data correctly such as:\n\n* Automatic data detection - Calling `metadata.detect_from_dataframe()` or `metadata.detect_from_csv()` will populate the metadata autonomously with values it thinks represent the data.\n* Easy updating - Once an instance of the metadata is created, values can be easily updated using a number of methods defined in the API. For more info, view the [docs](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/data-preparation/single-table-metadata-api).\n* Metadata validation - Calling `metadata.validate()` will return a report of any invalid definitions in the metadata specification.\n* Upgrading - Users with the previous metadata format can easily update to the new specification using the `upgrade_metadata()` method.\n* Saving and loading - The metadata itself can easily be saved to a json file and loaded back up later.\n\n### Class and Module Names\n\nAnother major change is the renaming of our core modeling classes and modules. The name changes are meant to highlight the difference between the underlying machine learning models, and the objects responsible for the end-to-end workflow of generating synthetic data. The main name changes are as follows:\n* `tabular` -> `single_table`\n* `relational` -> `multi_table`\n* `timeseries` -> `sequential`\n* `BaseTabularModel` -> `BaseSingleTableSynthesizer`\n* `GaussianCopula` -> `GaussianCopulaSynthesizer`\n* `CTGAN` -> `CTGANSynthesizer`\n* `TVAE` -> `TVAESynthesizer`\n* `CopulaGan` -> `CopulaGANSynthesizer`\n* `PAR` -> `PARSynthesizer`\n* `HMA1` -> `HMASynthesizer`\n\nIn `SDV` 1.0, synthesizers are classes that take in metadata and handle data preprocessing, model training and model sampling. This is similar to the previous `BaseTabularModel` in `SDV` <1.0.\n\n### Synthetic Data Workflow\n\n`Synthesizers` in `SDV` 1.0 define a clear workflow for generating synthetic data.\n1. Synthesizers are initialized with a metadata class.\n2. They can then be used to transform the data and apply constraints using the `synthesizer.preprocess()` method. This step also validates that the data matches the provided metadata to avoid errors in fitting or sampling.\n3. The processed data can then be fed into the underlying machine learning model using `synthesizer.fit_processed_data()`. (Alternatively, data can be preprocessed and fit to the model using `synthesizer.fit()`.)\n4. Data can then be sampled using `synthesizer.sample()`.\n\nEach synthesizer class also provides a series of methods to help users customize the transformations their data goes through. Read more about that [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthetic-data-workflow/transform-and-anonymize).\n\nNotice that the preprocessing and model fitting steps can now be separated. This can be helpful if preprocessing is time consuming or if the data has been processed externally.\n\n### Other Highly Requested Features\n\nAnother major addition is control over randomization. In `SDV` <1.0, users could set a seed to control the randomization for only some columns. In `SDV` 1.0, randomization is controlled for all columns. Every new call to sample generates new data, but the synthesizer's seed can be reset to the original state using `synthesizer.reset_randomization()`, enabling reproducibility.\n\n`SDV 1.0` adds accessibility and transparency into the transformers used for preprocessing and underlying machine learning models.\n* Using the `synthesizer.get_transformers()` method, you can access the transformers used to preprocess each column and view their properties. This can be useful for debugging and accessing privacy information like mappings used to mask data.\n* Distribution parameters learned by copula models can be accessed using the `synthesizer.get_learned_distributions()` method.\n\nPII handling is improved by the following features:\n* Primary keys can be set to natural sdtypes (eg. SSN, email, name). Previously they could only be numerical or text.\n* The `PseudoAnonymizedFaker` can be used to provide consistent mapping to PII columns. As mentioned before, the mapping itself can be accessed by viewing the transformers for the column using `synthesizer.get_transformers()`.\n* A bug causing PII columns to slow down modeling is patched.\n\nFinally, the synthetic data can now be easily evaluated using the `evaluate_quality()` and `run_diagnostic()` methods. The data can be compared visually to the actual data using the `get_column_plot()` and `get_column_pair_plot()` methods. For more info on how to visualize or interpret the synthetic data evaluation, read the docs [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/evaluation).\n\n### Issues Resolved\n\n#### New Features\n\n* Change auto_assign_transformers to handle id types -

This changes the transformers that are available in SDV models to be those that are in RDT version 1.2.0. As a result, some arguments for initializing models have changed.\n\nAdditionally, this release fixes bugs related to loading models with custom constraints. It also fixes a bug that added `NaNs` to the index of sampled data when using `sample_remaining_columns`.\n\n### Bugs Fixed\n\n* Incorrect rounding in Custom Constraint example - Issue [#941](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/941) by @amontanez24\n* Can't save the model if use the custom constraint - Issue [#928](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/928) by @pvk-developer\n* User Guide code fixes - Issue [#983](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/983) by @amontanez24\n* Index contains NaNs when using sample_remaining_columns - Issue [#985](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/985) by @amontanez24\n* Cannot sample after loading a model with custom constraints: TypeError - Issue [#984](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/984) by @pvk-developer\n* Set HyperTransformer config manually, based on Metadata if given - Issue [#982](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/982) by @pvk-developer\n\n### New Features\n\n* Change default metrics for evaluate - Issue [#949](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/949) by @fealho\n\n### Maintenance\n\n* Update the RDT version to 1.0 - Issue [#897](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/897) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 0.16.0 - 2022-07-21\n\nThis release brings user friendly improvements and bug fixes on the `SDV` constraints, to help\nusers generate their synthetic data easily.\n\nSome predefined constraints have been renamed and redefined to be more user friendly & consistent.\nThe custom constraint API has also been updated for usability. The SDV now automatically determines\nthe best `handling_strategy` to use for each constraint, attempting `transform` by default and\nfalling back to `reject_sampling` otherwise. The `handling_strategy` parameters are no longer\nincluded in the API.\n\nFinally, this version of `SDV` also unifies the parameters for all sampling related methods for\nall models (including TabularPreset).\n\n### Changes to Constraints\n\n* `GreatherThan` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Inequality`, which is\n  intended to be used between two columns, and `ScalarInequality`, which is intended to be used\n  between a column and a scalar.\n\n* `Between` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Range`, which is intended to\n  be used between three columns, and `ScalarRange`, which is intended to be used between a column\n  and low and high scalar values.\n\n* `FixedIncrements` a new constraint that makes the data increment by a certain value.\n* New `create_custom_constraint` function available to create custom constraints.\n\n### Removed Constraints\n* `Rounding` Rounding is automatically being handled by the ``rdt.HyperTransformer``.\n* `ColumnFormula` the `create_custom_constraint` takes place over this one and allows more\n  advanced usage for the end users.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Improve error message for invalid constraints - Issue [#801](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/801) by @fealho\n* Numerical Instability in Constrained GaussianCopula - Issue [#806](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/806) by @fealho\n* Unify sampling params for reject sampling - Issue [#809](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/809) by @amontanez24\n* Split `GreaterThan` constraint into `Inequality` and `ScalarInequality` - Issue [#814](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/814) by @fealho\n* Split `Between` constraint into `Range` and `ScalarRange` - Issue [#815](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/815) @pvk-developer\n* Change `columns` to `column_names` in `OneHotEncoding` and `Unique` constraints - Issue [#816](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/816) by @amontanez24\n* Update columns parameter in `Positive` and `Negative` constraint - Issue [#817](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/817) by @fealho\n* Create `FixedIncrements` constraint - Issue [#818](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/818) by @amontanez24\n* Improve datetime handling in `ScalarInequality` and `ScalarRange` constraints - Issue [#819](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/819) by @pvk-developer\n* Support strict boundaries even when transform strategy is used - Issue [#820](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/820) by @fealho\n* Add `create_custom_constraint` factory method - Issue [#836](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/836) by @fealho\n\n### Internal Improvements\n* Remove `handling_strategy` parameter - Issue [#833](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/833) by @amontanez24\n* Remove `fit_columns_model` parameter - Issue [#834](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/834) by @pvk-developer\n* Remove the `ColumnFormula` constraint - Issue [#837](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/837) by @amontanez24\n* Move `table_data.copy` to base class of constraints - Issue [#845](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/845) by @fealho\n\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Numerical Instability in Constrained GaussianCopula - Issue [#801](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/801) by @tlranda and @fealho\n* Fix error message for `FixedIncrements` - Issue [#865](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/865) by @pvk-developer\n* Fix constraints with conditional sampling - Issue [#866](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/866) by @amontanez24\n* Fix error message in `ScalarInequality` - Issue [#868](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/868) by @pvk-developer\n* Cannot use `max_tries_per_batch` on sample: `TypeError: sample() got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_tries_per_batch'` - Issue [#885](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/885) by @amontanez24\n* Conditional sampling + batch size: `ValueError: Length of values (1) does not match length of index (5)` - Issue [#886](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/886) by @amontanez24\n* `TabularPreset` doesn't support new sampling parameters - Issue [#887](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/887) by @fealho\n* Conditional Sampling: `batch_size` is being set to `None` by default? - Issue [#889](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/889) by @amontanez24\n* Conditional sampling using GaussianCopula inefficient when categories are noised - Issue [#910](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/910) by @amontanez24\n\n### Documentation Changes\n* Show the `API` for `TabularPreset` models - Issue [#854](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/854) by @katxiao\n* Update handling constraints doc - Pull Request [#856](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/856) by @amontanez24\n* Update custom costraints documentation - Pull Request [#857](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/857) by @pvk-developer\n\n## 0.15.0 - 2022-05-25\n\nThis release improves the speed of the `GaussianCopula` model by removing logic that previously searched for the appropriate distribution to\nuse. It also fixes a bug that was happening when conditional sampling was used with the `TabularPreset`.\n\nThe rest of the release focuses on making changes to improve constraints including changing the `UniqueCombinations` constraint to `FixedCombinations`,\nmaking the `Unique` constraint work with missing values and erroring when null values are seen in the `OneHotEncoding` constraint.\n\n### New Features\n* Silence warnings coming from univariate fit in copulas - Issue [#769](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/769) by @pvk-developer\n* Remove parameters related to distribution search and change default - Issue [#767](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/767) by @fealho\n* Update the UniqueCombinations constraint - Issue [#793](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/793) by @fealho\n* Make Unique constraint works with nans - Issue [#797](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/797) by @fealho\n* Error out if nans in OneHotEncoding - Issue [#800](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/800) by @amontanez24\n\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Unable to sample conditionally in Tabular_Preset model - Issue [#796](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/796) by @katxiao\n\n### Documentation Changes\n* Support GPU computing and progress track? - Issue [#478](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/478) by @fealho\n\n## 0.14.1 - 2022-05-03\n\nThis release adds a `TabularPreset`, available in the `sdv.lite` module, which allows users to easily optimize a tabular model for speed.\nIn this release, we also include bug fixes for sampling with conditions, an unresolved warning, and setting field distributions.

Also there\nis a new parameter to control the reject sampling crash, `graceful_reject_sampling`, which if\nset to `True` and if it's not possible to generate all the requested rows, it will just issue a\nwarning and return whatever it was able to generate.\n\nThe `Metadata` object can now be visualized using different combinations of `names` and `details`,\nwhich can be set to `True` or `False` in order to display only the table names with details or\nwithout. There is also an improvement on the `validation`, which now will display all the errors\nfound at the end of the validation instead of only the first one.\n\nThis version also exposes all the hyperparameters of the models `CTGAN` and `TVAE` to allow a more\nadvanced usage. There is also a fix for the `TVAE` model on small datasets and it's performance\nwith `NaN` values has been improved. There is a fix for when using\n`UniqueCombinationConstraint` with the `transform` strategy.\n\n### Issues resolved\n\n* Memory Usage Gaussian Copula Trained Model consuming high memory when generating synthetic data - Issue [#304](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/304) by @pvk-developer and @AnupamaGangadhar\n* Add option to visualize metadata with only table names - Issue [#347](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/347) by @csala\n* Add sample parameter to control reject sampling crash - Issue [#343](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/343) by @fealho\n* Verbose metadata validation - Issue [#348](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/348) by @csala\n* Missing the introduction of custom specification for hyperparameters in the TVAE model - Issue [#344](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/343) by @imkhoa99 and @pvk-developer\n\n## 0.8.0 - 2021-02-24\n\nThis version adds conditional sampling for tabular models by combining a reject-sampling\nstrategy with the native conditional sampling capabilities from the gaussian copulas.\n\nIt also introduces several upgrades on the HMA1 algorithm that improve data quality and\nrobustness in the multi-table scenarios by making changes in how the parameters of the child\ntables are aggregated on the parent tables, including a complete rework of how the correlation\nmatrices are modeled and rebuild after sampling.\n\n### Issues resolved\n\n* Fix probabilities contain NaN error - Issue [#326](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/326) by @csala\n* Conditional Sampling for tabular models - Issue [#316](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/316) by @fealho and @csala\n* HMA1: LinAlgError: SVD did not converge - Issue [#240](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/240) by @csala\n\n## 0.7.0 - 2021-01-27\n\nThis release introduces a few changes in the HMA1 relational algorithm to decrease modeling\nand sampling times, while also ensuring that correlations are properly kept across tables\nand also adding support for some relational schemas that were not supported before.\n\nA few changes in constraints and tabular models also ensure that situations that produced\nerrors before now work without errors.\n\n### Issues resolved\n\n* Fix unique key generation - Issue [#306](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/306) by @fealho\n* Ensure tables that contain nothing but ids can be modeled - Issue [#302](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/302) by @csala\n* Metadata visualization improvements - Issue [#301](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/301) by @csala\n* Multi-parent re-model and re-sample issue - Issue [#298](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/298) by @csala\n* Support datetimes in GreaterThan constraint - Issue [#266](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/266) by @rollervan\n* Support for multiple foreign keys in one table - Issue [#185](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/185) by @csala\n\n## 0.6.1 - 2020-12-31\n\nSDMetrics version is updated to include the new Time Series metrics, which have also\nbeen added to the API Reference and User Guides documentation.
