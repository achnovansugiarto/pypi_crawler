It provides advanced security techniques like *Differential Privacy*, *Homomorphic Encryption*, *K-anonymity* and *Federated Learning* to guarantee protection for your AI. With AIJack, you can test and simulate defenses against various attacks such as *Poisoning*, *Model Inversion*, *Backdoor*, and *Free-Rider*. We support more than 30 state-of-the-art methods. For more information, check our [documentation](https://koukyosyumei.github.io/AIJack/) and start securing your AI today with AIJack.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install AIJack with `pip`. AIJack requires Boost and pybind11.\n\n```\napt install -y libboost-all-dev\npip install -U pip\npip install \"pybind11[global]\"\n\npip install aijack\n```\n\nIf you want to use the latest-version, you can directly install from GitHub.\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/AIJack\n```\n\nWe also provide [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).\n\n\n# Quick Start\n\nWe briefly introduce the overview of AIJack.\n\n## Features\n\n-   All-around abilities for both attack & defense\n-   PyTorch-friendly design\n-   Compatible with scikit-learn\n-   Fast Implementation with C++ backend\n-   MPI-Backend for Federated Learning\n-   Extensible modular APIs\n\n## Basic Interface\n\nFor standard machine learning algorithms, AIJack allows you to simulate attacks against machine learning models with `Attacker` APIs. AIJack mainly supports PyTorch or sklearn models.\n\n```Python\n# abstract code\n\nattacker = Attacker(target_model)\nresult = attacker.attack()\n```\n\nFor distributed learning such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, AIJack offers four basic APIs: `Client`, `Server`, `API`, and `Manager`. `Client` and `Server` represent each client and server within each distributed learning scheme. You can execute training by registering the clients and servers to `API` and running it. `Manager` gives additional abilities such as attack, defense, or parallel computing to `Client`, `Server` or `API` via `attach` method.\n\n```Python\n# abstract code\n\nclient = [Client(), Client()]\nserver = Server()\napi = API(client, server)\napi.run() # execute training\n\nc_manager = ClientManagerForAdditionalAbility(...)\ns_manager = ServerManagerForAdditionalAbility(...)\nExtendedClient = c_manager.attach(Client)\nExtendedServer = c_manager.attach(Server)\n\nextended_client = [ExtendedClient(...), ExtendedClient(...)]\nextended_server = ExtendedServer(...)\napi = API(extended_client, extended_server)\napi.run() # execute training\n```\n\nFor example, the bellow code implements the scenario where the server in Federated Learning tries to steal the training data with gradient-based model inversion attack.\n\n```Python\nfrom aijack.collaborative.fedavg import FedAVGAPI, FedAVGClient, FedAVGServer\nfrom aijack.attack.inversion import GradientInversionAttackServerManager\n\nmanager = GradientInversionAttackServerManager(input_shape)\nFedAVGServerAttacker = manager.attach(FedAVGServer)\n\nclients = [FedAVGClient(model_1), FedAVGClient(model_2)]\nserver = FedAVGServerAttacker(clients, model_3)\n\napi = FedAVGAPI(server, clients, criterion, optimizers, dataloaders)\napi.run()\n```\n\n## Resources\n\nYou can also find more examples in our tutorials and documentation.\n\n-

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
