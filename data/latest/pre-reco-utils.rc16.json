We also added tools to facilitate the use of Microsoft News dataset (MIND). In addition, we publised our KDD2020 tutorial where we built a recommender of COVID papers using Microsoft Academic Graph.\n\nWe also changed the default branch from master to main. Now when you download the repo, you will get main branch.\n\nSee past announcements in [NEWS.md](NEWS.md).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:\n\n- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm\n- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).\n- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics\n- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models\n- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure\n\nSeveral utilities are provided in [reco_utils](reco_utils) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [reco_utils documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease see the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details on setting up your machine locally, on a [data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) or on [Azure Databricks](SETUP.md#setup-guide-for-azure-databricks).\n\nTo setup on your local machine:\n\n1. Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is a quick way to get started.\n\n2. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders\n```\n\n3. Run the generate conda file script to create a conda environment: (This is for a basic python environment, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for PySpark and GPU environment setup)\n\n```bash\ncd Recommenders\npython tools/generate_conda_file.py\nconda env create -f reco_base.yaml  \n```\n\n4. Activate the conda environment and register it with Jupyter:\n\n```bash\nconda activate reco_base\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name reco_base --display-name \"Python (reco)\"\n```\n\n5. Start the Jupyter notebook server\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n6. Run the [SAR Python CPU MovieLens](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) notebook under the `00_quick_start` folder. Make sure to change the kernel to \"Python (reco)\".\n\n**NOTE** - The [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) notebooks require a PySpark environment to run. Please follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to run these notebooks in a PySpark environment. For the deep learning algorithms, it is recommended to use a GPU machine.\n\n## Algorithms\n\nThe table below lists the recommender algorithms currently available in the repository.

In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.\n\n| Algo | MAP | nDCG@k | Precision@k | Recall@k | RMSE | MAE | R<sup>2</sup> | Explained Variance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [ALS](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) | 0.004732 |\t0.044239 |\t0.048462 |\t0.017796 | 0.965038 |\t0.753001 |\t0.255647 |\t0.251648 |\n| [BPR](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/cornac_bpr_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.105365\t| 0.389948 |\t0.349841 |\t0.181807 | N/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\tN/A |\n| [FastAI](examples/00_quick_start/fastai_movielens.ipynb) | 0.025503 |\t0.147866 |\t0.130329 |\t0.053824 | 0.943084 |\t0.744337 |\t0.285308 |\t0.287671 |\n| [LightGCN](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/lightgcn_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.088526 | 0.419846 | 0.379626 | 0.144336 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| [NCF](examples/02_model_hybrid/ncf_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.107720\t| 0.396118 |\t0.347296 |\t0.180775 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| [SAR](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) | 0.110591 |\t0.382461 | \t0.330753 | 0.176385 | 1.253805 | 1.048484 |\t-0.569363 |\t0.030474 |\n| [SVD](examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/surprise_svd_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.012873\t| 0.095930 |\t0.091198 |\t0.032783 | 0.938681 | 0.742690 | 0.291967 | 0.291971 |\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
