    "description": "========\ngit-flow\n========\n\nPure-Python implementation of Git extensions to provide high-level\nrepository operations for Vincent Driessen's\n`branching model <http://nvie.com/git-model>`_.\n\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/chassing/gitflow.svg?branch=develop\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/chassing/gitflow\n\n\nGetting started\n================\n\nFor the best introduction to get started with ``git flow``, please read\nJeff Kreeftmeijer's blog post http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow.\n\nOr have a look at one of these screen casts:\n\n* `How to use a scalable Git branching model called git-flow\n  <http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow>`_\n  (by Build a Module)\n\n* `A short introduction to git-flow <http://vimeo.com/16018419>`_\n  (by Mark Derricutt)\n\n* `On the path with git-flow\n  <http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov>`_\n  (by Dave Bock)\n\n\nInstalling git-flow\n====================\n\nYou can install ``git-flow``, using::\n\n    pip install nu-gitflow\n\n``git-flow`` requires Python >= 2.7 or Python >= 3.4.\n\nIntegration with your shell\n-----------------------------\n\nFor those who use the `Bash <http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ or\n`ZSH <http://www.zsh.org>`_ shell, please check out the excellent work\non the\n`git-flow-completion <http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion>`_\nproject by `bobthecow <http://github.com/bobthecow>`_. It offers\ntab-completion for all git-flow subcommands and branch names.\n\n\nPlease help out\n==================\n\nThis project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are\nvery welcome and I encourage you to use the `Issues list\n<http://github.com/chassing/gitflow/issues>`_ on Github to provide that\nfeedback.\n\nFeel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions. For a list\nof all contributors, please see the file `AUTHORS.txt`.\n\nYou will need `unittest2` to run the tests.\n\n\nLicense terms\n==================\n\ngit-flow is published under the liberal terms of the BSD License, see\nthe file `LICENSE.txt`. Although the BSD License does not\nrequire you to share any modifications you make to the source code,\nyou are very much encouraged and invited to contribute back your\nmodifications to the community, preferably in a Github fork, of\ncourse.\n\n\ngit flow usage\n==================\n\nInitialization\n---------------------\n\nTo initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use::\n\n    git flow init [-d]\n\nThis will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which\nbranches you would like to use as development and production branches,\nand how you would like your prefixes be named. You may simply press\nReturn on any of those questions to accept the (sane) default\nsuggestions.\n\nThe ``-d`` flag will accept all defaults.\n\n\nCreating feature/release/hotfix/support branches\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n* To list/start/finish feature branches, use::\n\n      git flow feature\n      git flow feature start <name> [<base>]\n      git flow feature finish <name>\n\n  For feature branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``develop``.\n\n* To push/pull a feature branch to the remote repository, use::\n\n      git flow feature publish <name>\n      git flow feature pull <remote> <name>\n\n* To list/start/finish release branches, use::\n\n      git flow release\n      git flow release start <release> [<base>]\n      git flow release finish <release>\n\n  For release branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``develop``.\n\n* To list/start/finish hotfix branches, use::\n\n      git flow hotfix\n      git flow hotfix start <release> [<base>]\n      git flow hotfix finish <release>\n\n  For hotfix branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``master``.\n\n* To list/start support branches, use::\n\n      git flow support\n      git flow support start <release> <base>\n\n  For support branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``master``.\n\n\nHistory of the Project\n=========================\n\ngitflow was originally developed by Vincent Driessen as a set of\nshell-scripts. In Juni 2007 he started a Python rewrite but did not\nfinish it. In February 2012 Hartmut Goebel started completing the\nPython rewrite and asked Vincent to pull his changes. But in June 2012\nVincent closed the pull-request and deleted his ``python-rewrite``\nbranch. So Hartmut decided to release the Python rewrite on his own.\n\nIn year 2015 Hartmuts gitflow was abandoned and the python 3\nsupport was missing. So Christian Assing decided to fork his version\nand release it as a new python based gitflow alternative.\n\n\n",
