    "description": "# Summary\nThe purpose of this software is to find the optimal transmit volume for a push-to-talk (PTT) communications device performing Mission Critical Voice (MCV) quality of experience (QoE) measurements using a transmit volume optimization (TVO) tool. TVO should be performed for every combination of PTT device under test and every audio file used in performing MCV QoE measurements.  \n\nAdditional scripts not mentioned in the README that live in the repository are helper functions utilized in the main scripts listed.\n\n## Obtaining Software\n- Code available at: https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QOE-TVO\n- Data available at: https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2432\n- Paper available at: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2171\n\n## Obtaining Data \nData is available at: https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2432\n\n## Hardware Requirements \nSee the following:\n- Optimal Transmit Volume Conditions for Mission Critical Voice Quality of Experience Measurement Systems\n  - https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2171 \n- Mission Critical Voice QoE Access Time Measurement Methods \n  - https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime\n  - https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/mission-critical-voice-qoe-access-time-measurement-methods\n\n**Additional details and information can be found in the paper linked above.**\n\n\n\n# Running TVO \n\n## Installing Software\nTo install the software run\n```\npip install mcvqoe-tvo\n```\n\nAlternatively, one could clone this repository and run the following from the root of the git repository:\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n## Running a measurement\nThe easiest way to use the measurement system is to run the GUI (https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe).\n\n# Audio Files\nAudio files can be found in the `mcvqoe/tvo/audio_clips` folder. By default, all four of these audio files are used. The csv files with cutpoints, as well as the test wav files, are included. \n\n\n# TECHNICAL SUPPORT\nFor more information or assistance on optimal transmit volume measurements please contact:\n\nChelsea Greene\\\nPublic Safety Communications Research Division\\\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\\\n325 Broadway\\\nBoulder, CO 80305\\\n303-497-6852; Chelsea.Greene@nist.gov or PSCR@PSCR.gov\n\n# Disclaimer\n**Much of the included software was developed by NIST employees, for that software the following disclaimer applies:**\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
