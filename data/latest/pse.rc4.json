    "description": "The Python Servlet Engine (PSE) is an application server for web-based\napplications written in the Python programming language.  It offers\npowerful templating tools, separation of presentation and implementation,\nand unlimited extensibility through its plugin and custom tag APIs.\nPSE includes some default plugins that allow automatic session\nmanagement, persistent data and access to client and server information.\nCompiled ``servlets'' are written in Python to produce application\noutput.  This means that each page runs very fast because it is the\nresult of executing compiled Python code --- no need for parsing past\nthe first run, as with other web application servers.",
