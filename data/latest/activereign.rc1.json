After writing the entire tool with pysmb, and adding features such as the ability to open and scan docx an xlsx files, I slowly started adding functionality from the awesome [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) library; just simple features I wanted to see in an internal penetration testing tool. The more I added, the more it looked like a Python3 rewrite of [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) created from scratch. \n \nIf you are doing a direct comparison, [CME](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) is an amazing tool that has way more features than currently implement here. However, I added a few new features and modifications that may come in handy during an assessment.\n### For more documentation checkout the project [wiki](https://github.com/m8r0wn/ActiveReign/wiki)\n\n### Operational Modes\n* db    - Query or insert values in to the ActiveReign database\n* enum  - System enumeration & module execution\n* shell - Spawn a simulated shell on the target system and perform command execution\n* spray - Domain password spraying and brute force\n* query - Perform LDAP queries on the domain\n\n\n### Key Features\n* Automatically extract domain information via LDAP and incorporate into network enumeration.\n* Perform Domain password spraying using LDAP to remove users close to lockout thresholds.\n* Local and remote command execution, for use on multiple starting points throughout the network.\n* Simulated interactive shell on target system, with file upload and download capabilities.\n* Data discovery capable of scanning xlsx and docx files.\n* Various modules to add and extend capabilities.\n\n\n### Acknowledgments\nThere were many intended and unintended contributors that made this project possible. If I am missing any, I apologize, it was in no way intentional. Feel free to contact me and we can make sure they get the credit they deserve ASAP!\n* [@byt3bl33d3r](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r) -  [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)\n* [@SecureAuthCorp](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp) - [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\n* [@the-useless-one](https://github.com/the-useless-one) - [pywerview](https://github.com/the-useless-one/pywerview)\n* [@dirkjanm](https://github.com/dirkjanm) - [ldapdomaindump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nWriting this tool and testing on a variety of networks/systems has taught me that execution method matters, and depends on the configuration of the system. If a specific module or feature does not work, determine if it is actually the program, target system, configuration, or even network placement before creating an issue.\n\nTo help this investigation process, I have created a ```test_execution``` module to run against a system with known admin privileges. This will cycle through all all execution methods and provide a status report to determine the best method to use:\n```bash\n$ activereign enum -u administrator -p Password123 --local-auth -M test_execution 192.168.1.1\n[*] Lockout Tracker             Threshold extracted from database: 5\n[*] Enum Authentication         \\administrator (Password: P****) (Hash: False)\n[+] DC01                        192.168.1.1     ENUM             Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 7601 Service Pack 1    (Domain: DEMO)   (Signing: True)  (SMBv1: True) (Adm!n) \n[*] DC01                        192.168.1.1     TEST_EXECUTION   Testing execution methods                              \n[*] DC01                        192.168.1.1     TEST_EXECUTION   Execution Method: WMIEXEC    Fileless: SUCCESS   Remote (Defualt): SUCCESS\n[*] DC01                        192.168.1.1     TEST_EXECUTION   Execution Method: SMBEXEC    Fileless: SUCCESS   Remote (Defualt): SUCCESS\n[*] DC01                        192.168.1.1     TEST_EXECUTION   Execution Method: ATEXEC     Fileless: SUCCESS   Remote (Defualt): SUCCESS\n[*] DC01                        192.168.1.1     TEST_EXECUTION   Execution Method: WINRM      Fileless: N/A       Remote (Defualt): SUCCESS\n```",
