We've implemented more than two dozen speedup methods that can be applied to your training loop in just a few lines of code, or used with our built-in Trainer. We continually integrate the latest state-of-the-art in efficient neural network training.\n\nComposer features:\n- 20+ methods for speeding up training networks for computer vision and natural language. Don't waste hours trying to reproduce research papers when Composer has done the work for you.\n- An easy-to-use trainer that has been written to be as performant as possible and [integrates best practices](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/5-best-practices-for-efficient-model-training) for efficient, multi-GPU training.\n- Functional forms of all of our speedup methods that allow you to integrate them into your existing training loop.\n- Strong, reproducible baselines to get you started as quickly as possible.\n\n## Benefits\n\n<!-- start main results -->\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.mosaicml.com/images/composer_graph_light_06212022.svg?ref=Fiey0Xei#gh-light-mode-only\" class=\"only-light\">\n    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.mosaicml.com/images/composer_graph_light_06212022.svg?ref=Fiey0Xei\" width=\"75%\"/>\n  </a>\n  <!-- link to the light mode image even on dark mode, so it will be readable in a new tab -->\n  \n</p>\n<!-- end main results -->\n\nWith no additional tuning, you can apply our methods to:\n<!-- start numbers -->\n- Train ResNet-50 on ImageNet to the standard 76.6% top-one accuracy for \\$15 in 27 minutes (_with vanilla PyTorch:_ \\$116 in 3.5 hours) on AWS.\n- Train GPT-2 125M to the standard perplexity of 24.11 for \\$145 in 4.5 hours (_with vanilla PyTorch_: \\$255 in 7.8 hours) on AWS.\n- Train DeepLab-v3 on ADE20k to the standard mean IOU of 45.7 for \\$36 in 1.1 hours (_with vanilla PyTorch_: \\$110 in 3.5 hours) on AWS.\n<!-- end numbers -->\n\n# 🚀 Quickstart\n\n## 💾 Installation\nComposer is available with Pip:\n\n<!--pytest.mark.skip-->\n```bash\npip install mosaicml\n```\nAlternatively, install Composer with Conda:\n\n<!--pytest.mark.skip-->\n```bash\nconda install -c mosaicml mosaicml\n```\n---\n\n## 🚌 Usage\n\nYou can use Composer's speedup methods in two ways:\n\n* Through a standalone **Functional API** (similar to `torch.nn.functional`) that allows you to integrate them into your existing training code.\n* Using Composer's built-in **Trainer**, which is designed to be performant and automatically takes care of the details of using speedup methods.\n\n### Example: Functional API [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/functional_api.ipynb)\n\nIntegrate our speedup methods into your training loop with just a few lines of code, and see the results. Here we easily apply [BlurPool](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/method_cards/blurpool.html) and [SqueezeExcite](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/method_cards/squeeze_excite.html):\n\n<!-- begin_example_1 --->\n```python\nimport composer.functional as cf\nfrom torchvision import models\n\nmy_model = models.resnet18()\n\n# add blurpool and squeeze excite layers\ncf.apply_blurpool(my_model)\ncf.apply_squeeze_excite(my_model)\n\n# your own training code starts here\n```\n<!-- end_example_1 --->\n\nFor more examples, see the [Composer Functional API Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/functional_api.ipynb) and [Functional API guide](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/latest/functional_api.html).\n\n### Example: Trainer [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/getting_started.ipynb)\n\nFor the best experience and the most efficient possible training, we recommend using Composer's built-in trainer, which automatically takes care of the details of using speedup methods and provides useful abstractions that facilitate rapid experimentation.\n\n<!-- begin_example_2 --->\n<!--pytest.mark.gpu-->\n<!--pytest.mark.filterwarnings(r'ignore:Some targets have less than 1 total probability:UserWarning')-->\n<!--\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# adaptive_avg_pool2d_backward_cuda in mnist_classifier is not deterministic\ntorch.use_deterministic_algorithms(False)\n\n```\n-->\n<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->\n```python\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\n\nfrom composer import Trainer\nfrom composer.algorithms import ChannelsLast, CutMix, LabelSmoothing\nfrom composer.models import mnist_model\n\ntransform =

     LabelSmoothing(smoothing=0.1),\n    ]\n)\ntrainer.fit()\n```\n<!-- end_example_2 -->\n\nComposer's built-in [trainer](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/trainer/using_the_trainer.html) makes it easy to **add multiple speedup methods in a single line of code!**\nTrying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list.\n\nHere are some examples of methods available in Composer ([_see here for the full list_](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/latest/trainer/algorithms.html)):\n\nName|Attribution|tl;dr|Example Benchmark|Speed

time-to-train to the same quality as the baseline.</p>\n\n## 🛠 Building Speedup Recipes\n\nGiven two methods that speed up training by 1.5x each, do they combine to provide a 2.25x (1.5x * 1.5x) speedup? Not necessarily.\nThey may optimize the [same part of the training process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law) and lead to diminishing returns, or they may even interact in ways that prove detrimental.\nDetermining which methods to compose together isn't as simple as assembling a set of methods that perform best individually.\n\n**We have come up with compositions of methods that work especially well together** through rigorous exploration of the design space of recipes and research on the science behind composition.\nThe [MosaicML Explorer](https://app.mosaicml.com/) contains all of the data we have collected so far on composition, and it highlights the compositions of methods that are _pareto-optimal_ - that provide the **best possible tradeoffs between training time or cost and the quality of the trained model**.\nWhether you want to reach the same quality faster or get better quality within your current budget, Explorer can help you decide which speedup methods to use.\nWe update this data regularly as we add new methods and develop better recipes.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img

months](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924), putting such models further and further out of reach for most researchers and practitioners with each passing day.\n\nComposer addresses this challenge by focusing on training efficiency: it contains cutting-edge speedup methods that modify the training algorithm to reduce the time and cost necessary to train deep learning models.\n**When you use Composer, you can rest assured that you are training efficiently.**\nWe have combed the literature, done the science, and built industrial-grade implementations to ensure this is the case.\n\n### Flexibility\n\nEven after these speedup methods are implemented, assembling them together into recipes is nontrivial. We designed Composer with the **right abstractions for composing (and creating new) speedup methods.**\n\nSpecifically, Composer uses two-way callbacks ([Howard et al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04688)) to modify the **entire training state** at particular events in the training loop to effect speedups. We handle collisions between methods, proper method ordering, and more.\n\nThrough this, methods can modify:\n - data inputs for batches (data augmentations, sequence length warmup, skipping examples, etc.)\n - neural network architecture (pruning, model surgery, etc.)\n - loss function (label smoothing, MixUp, CutMix, etc.)\n - optimizer (Sharpness Aware Minimization)\n - training dynamics (layer freezing, selective backprop, etc.)\n\nYou can easily [add your own methods](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/custom_speedup_methods.ipynb) or callbacks to try out your ideas or modify any part of the training loop.\n\n### Support\n\nComposer is an active and ongoing project. We will respond quickly to issues filed in this repository.\n\n# 🧐 Why shouldn’t I use Composer?\n\n* Composer is mostly optimized for computer vision and natural language processing. If you work on, e.g., reinforcement learning, you might encounter rough edges when using Composer.\n* Composer currently only supports NVIDIA GPUs, although we're working on adding alternatives.\n* Since Composer is still in alpha, our API may not be stable. We recommend pegging your work to a Composer version.\n\n# 📚 Learn More\n\nHere are some resources actively maintained by the Composer community to help you get started:\n<table>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n      <th><b>Resource</b></th>\n      <th><b>Details</b></th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/getting_started.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting started with our Trainer</a></td>\n    <td>A Colab Notebook showing how to use our Trainer</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/functional_api.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting started with our Functional API</a></td>\n    <td>A Colab Notebook showing how to use our Functional API</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/custom_speedup_methods.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building Speedup Methods</a></td>\n    <td>A Colab Notebook showing how to build new training modifications on top of Composer</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/examples/finetune_huggingface.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Training BERTs with Composer and 🤗 </a></td>\n    <td>A Colab Notebook showing how to train BERT models with Composer and 🤗!</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mosaicml), [email](mailto:community@mosaicml.com), or our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mosaicml-community/shared_invite/zt-1dc6mo5wg-arlv6Oo9JjEn_g4d5s7PXQ)!\n\n# 💫 Contributors\nComposer is part of the broader Machine Learning community, and we welcome any contributions, pull requests, or issues!\n\nTo start contributing, see our [Contributing](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\nP.S.: [We're hiring](https://mosaicml.com/jobs)!\n\n# ✍️ Citation\n```\n@misc{mosaicml2022composer,\n    author = {The Mosaic ML Team},\n    title = {composer},\n    year = {2021},\n    howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/}},\n}\n```\n",
