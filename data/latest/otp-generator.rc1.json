    "description": "# OTP Generator\n\n**A Python tool to generate and verify One Time Password (OTP)**\n\nThis tool is designed to enable developers generate and verify OTP using Python [cyrptophy](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) package.\n\n\nAn OtpServer class provides basic operations for generating and verifying OTP. \nThere is no database support provided for saving to a given database rather hooks are provided as functions. \nThe function hooks take two parameters: a callable and a data. \nThe callable is any class, method, or function which should be executed when an event occurs. \nThe data parameter is used to pass any set of information or data to the callable during execution.\n\nThe hooks simply perform a function call without any data processing or checks. \n**Developers are expected to perform necessary modifications to make this tool fit their designed system(s).** \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe OTP generator was developed as a means of authenticating user's email, mobile or identity. \n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis application depends on `cryptography` package. The target Python for current implementation is Python 3.8\n\n## Build Status\n\n**Version: 0.1.0**\n\nCurrent development of `otp_generator` is version 0.1.0. This is considered the Alpha Edition.\n\n## Features\n\nCurrent build features include:\n\n+ Generate OTP with corresponding data for later verification of the generated code\n+ Verify OTP code using stored data that does not identify the generated OTP code.\n\nIt is assumed that all data generated for a given OTP code are securely saved. \nDevelopers are to ensure storage and retrieval of data. Various function hooks are provided to this end. \n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease visit application repo for further information on extending project. Ideas and comments will be reasonably\nappreciated.\n\n## Author\n\nCurrent development is by Aniefiok Friday [@frier17](https://gitlab.com/frier17).\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nhttps://mit-license.org/\n\nFor details read license contract [here](https://mit-license.org/)\n\nCopyright 2021 @frier17\n\nLicensed under the MIT License (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
