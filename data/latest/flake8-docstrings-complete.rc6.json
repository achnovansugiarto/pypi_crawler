    "description": "# flake8-docstrings-complete\n\nLinter that checks docstrings of functions, methods and classes. It should be\nused in conjunction with `pydocstyle` (or `flake8-docstrings`) as the linter\nassumes that the docstrings already pass `pydocstyle` checks. This\n[blog post](https://jdkandersson.com/2023/01/07/writing-great-docstrings-in-python/)\ndiscusses how to write great docstrings and the motivation for this linter!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```shell\npython -m venv venv\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\npip install flake8 flake8-docstrings flake8-docstrings-complete\nflake8 source.py\n```\n\nOn the following code where the `foo` function has the `bar` and `baz`\narguments where the `baz` argument is missing from the `Args` section in the\ndocstring:\n\n```Python\n# source.py\ndef foo(bar, baz):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action on bar.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: The value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nThis will produce warnings such as:\n\n```shell\nflake8 test_source.py\nsource.py:2:14: DCO023 \"baz\" argument should be described in the docstring, more information: https://github.com/jdkandersson/flake8-docstrings-complete#fix-dco023\n```\n\nThis can be resolved by adding the `baz` argument to the `Args` section:\n\n```Python\n# source.py\ndef foo(bar, baz):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action on bar.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: The value to perform the foo action on.\n        baz: The modifier to the foo action.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n`flake8-docstrings-complete` adds the following checks to complement\n`pydocstyle`:\n\n1. If a function/ method has arguments, that the arguments section is included.\n2. If a function/ method has arguments, that all function/ method arguments are\n   in the argument section.\n3. If an arguments section is in the function/ method docstring, the argument\n   section contains no arguments the function/ method doesn't have.\n4. Function/ method arguments are only documented once.\n5. If a function/ method has a return statement with a value, the return value\n   section is included.\n6. If a function/ method has a yield statement with a value, the yield value\n   section is included.\n7. If a function/ method raises an exception, the raises section is included\n   with a description for each exception that is raised.\n8. Each raised exception is only described once.\n9. If a class has public attributes, that the attributes section is included.\n10. If a class has public attributes, that all public attributes are in the\n   attributes section.\n11. If an attributes section is in the class docstring, the attributes section\n   contains no attributes the class doesn't have.\n12. Class attributes are only documented once.\n13. Any of the sections being checked are not present multiple times.\n\nNote:\n\n- `self` and `cls` are not counted as arguments.\n- `test_.*` methods are skipped in `test_.*\\.py` files (function and file names\n  are configurable).\n- functions with a `@fixture` et al dectorator in `conftest.py` and\n  `test_.*\\.py` files are skipped (function and fixture file names are\n  configurable)\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe plugin adds the following configurations to `flake8`:\n\n- `--docstrings-complete-test-filename-pattern`: The filename pattern for test\n  files. Defaults to `test_.*\\.py`.\n- `--docstrings-complete-test-function-pattern`: The function name pattern for\n  test functions. Defaults to `test_.*`.\n- `--docstrings-complete-fixture-filename-pattern`: The filename pattern for\n  fixture files. Defaults to `conftest\\.py`.\n- `--docstrings-complete-fixture-decorator-pattern`: The decorator name pattern\n  for fixture functions. Defaults to `(^|\\.)fixture$`.\n\n## Rules\n\nA few rules have been defined to allow for selective suppression:\n\n- `DCO010`: docstring missing on a function/ method/ class.\n- `DCO020`: function/ method has one or more arguments and the docstring does\n  not have an arguments section.\n- `DCO021`: function/ method with no arguments and the docstring has an\n  arguments section.\n- `DCO022`: function/ method with one or more arguments and the docstring has\n  multiple arguments sections.\n- `DCO023`: function/ method has one or more arguments not described in the\n  docstring.\n- `DCO024`: function/ method has one or more arguments described in the\n  docstring which are not arguments of the function/ method.\n- `DCO025`: function/ method has one or more arguments described in the\n  docstring multiple times.\n- `DCO030`: function/ method that returns a value does not have the returns\n  section in the docstring.\n- `DCO031`: function/ method that does not return a value has the returns\n  section in the docstring.\n- `DCO032`: function/ method that returns a value and the docstring has\n  multiple returns sections.\n- `DCO040`: function/ method that yields a value does not have the yields\n  section in the docstring.\n- `DCO041`: function/ method that does not yield a value has the yields\n  section in the docstring.\n- `DCO042`: function/ method that yields a value and the docstring has\n  multiple yields sections.\n- `DCO050`: function/ method raises one or more exceptions and the docstring\n  does not have a raises section.\n- `DCO051`: function/ method that raises no exceptions and the docstring has a\n  raises section.\n- `DCO052`: function/ method that raises one or more exceptions and the\n  docstring has multiple raises sections.\n- `DCO053`: function/ method that raises one or more exceptions where one or\n  more of the exceptions is not described in the docstring.\n- `DCO054`: function/ method has one or more exceptions described in the\n  docstring which are not raised in the function/ method.\n- `DCO055`: function/ method that has a raise without an exception has an empty\n  raises section in the docstring.\n- `DCO056`: function/ method has one or more exceptions described in the\n  docstring multiple times.\n- `DCO060`: class has one or more public attributes and the docstring does not\n  have an attributes section.\n- `DCO061`: class with no attributes and the docstring has an attributes\n  section.\n- `DCO062`: class with one or more attributes and the docstring has multiple\n  attributes sections.\n- `DCO063`: class has one or more public attributes not described in the\n  docstring.\n- `DCO064`: class has one or more attributes described in the docstring which\n  are not attributes of the class.\n- `DCO065`: class has one or more attributes described in the docstring\n  multiple times.\n\n### Fix DCO010\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method/ class without a\ndocstring. For example:\n\n```Python\ndef foo():\n    pass\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\nclass FooClass:\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n    def foo(self):\n        pass\n```\n\nThis example can be fixed by adding a docstring:\n\n```Python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n    def foo(self):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Fix DCO020\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method that has one or more\narguments with a docstring that does not have an arguments section. For\nexample:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n```\n\nThese examples can be fixed by adding the arguments section and describing all\narguments in the arguments section:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Arguments:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Parameters:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Fix DCO021\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method that has no arguments with\na docstring that has an arguments section. For example:\n\n```Python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Arguments:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Parameters:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nThese examples can be fixed by removing the arguments section:\n\n```Python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Fix DCO022\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method that has one or more\narguments and a docstring that has multiple arguments sections. For example:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n\n    Arguments:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n\n    Parameters:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nThese examples can be fixed by removing the additional arguments sections:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Arguments:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Parameters:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Fix DCO023\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method that has one or more\narguments where one or more of those arguments is not described in the\ndocstring. For example:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar, baz):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nThese examples can be fixed by adding the missing arguments to the arguments\nsection:\n\n```Python\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef foo(bar, baz):\n    \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n    Args:\n        bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        baz: the modifier to the foo action.\n    \"\"\"\n\nclass FooClass:\n    def foo(self, bar):\n        \"\"\"Perform foo action.\n\n        Args:\n            bar: the value to perform the foo action on.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Fix DCO024\n\nThis linting rule is triggered by a function/ method that has one or more\narguments and a docstring that describes one or more arguments where on or more\nof the described arguments are not arguments of the function/ method.

Look for a line that has zero or more whitespace characters, followed by a\n   section name (non-case-sensistive) followed by a colon.\n2. Look for any sub-sections on a line which starts with zero or more\n   whitespace characters followed by a word, optionally followed by whitespace\n   and any characters within round brackets followed by a colon.\n3. The section ends if any line with zero or more whitespace characters is\n   encountered or the end of the docstring is reached.\n\n## Future Ideas:\n\n- Check that argument, exceptions and attributes have non-empty description.\n- Check that arguments, exceptions and attributes are only documented once.\n- Check that arguments, exceptions and attributes have meaningful descriptions.\n- Check other other PEP257 conventions\n",
