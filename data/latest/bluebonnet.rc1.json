The main tools are:\n\n1. `fluids` for modeling PVT and viscosity of oil, water, and gas;\n2. `flow` for building physics-based production curves; and\n3. `forecast` for fitting and forecasting unconventional production.\n\nExamples can be found in\n[the documentation](https://bluebonnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow.html).\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing? Check out the\n[contributing guidelines](https://bluebonnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nto get started. Please note that this project is released with a Code of\nConduct. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n### Contributor Hall of Fame\n\nMichael Marder\n\n## License\n\n`bluebonnet` was created by Frank Male. It is licensed under the terms of the\nBSD 3-Clause license.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis work was funded in part by an ExxonMobil grant to the University of Texas\nat Austin, with Michael Marder as PI and Larry Lake as co-PI. The Physics-based\nscaling curve was developed for shale gas reservoirs by Patzek et al. (2013). It\nwas extended to tight oil by Male (2019). It was extended to two-phase by Ruiz\nMaraggi et al. (2020). It was extended to include variable fracture face\npressure by Ruiz Maraggi et al. (2021). In the future, it might be extended\nfurther.  \n`bluebonnet` was created with\n[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the\n`py-pkgs-cookiecutter`\n[template](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter).\n\n## Bibliography\n\nPapers developing or using this approach include:\n\n1.
