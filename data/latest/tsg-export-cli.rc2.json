    "description": "# TSG Export CLI\nProvides access to the `tsg-cli` command that exports tsg data\n\n## Installation\nDue to a direct dependency, the installation requires two steps. Replace `pip` with `pip3` if `pip` is unrecognised or bound to python2.\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/CSIRO-GeoscienceAnalytics/tsg-xr@8aea5c890daa4663e5d7251f2f0ca584b61e2237\npip install tsg-export-cli\n```\n\n## Usage\n### Producing Scalar Dumps\n```bash\ntsg-cli export-csvs --help\n```\n\n### Producing Borehole Imagery\nA downsampling factor of `q` results in a performance boost and quality reduction of `qÂ²`.\n\nIf images are meant for human viewing use the depth delta (`-d`) to get smaller and wider images. 0.5m of core per image is a good start.\n```bash\ntsg-cli export-images --help\n```\n\n## For Development\n## Package Build & Upload\n```bash\npython -m build && python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*\n```\n",
