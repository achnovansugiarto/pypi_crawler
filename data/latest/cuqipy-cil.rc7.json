    "description": "# CUQIpy-CIL\n\nCUQIpy-CIL is a plugin for the [CUQIpy](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) software package.\n\nIt adds a thin wrapper around Computed Tomography (CT) forward models from the Core Imaging Library (CIL).\n\n## Installation\nFirst install [CIL](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL). Then install CUQIpy-CIL with pip:\n```bash\npip install cuqipy-cil\n```\nIf CUQIpy is not installed, it will be installed automatically.\n\n## Quickstart\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cuqi\nimport cuqipy_cil\n\n# Load a CT forward model and data from testproblem library\nA, y_data, info = cuqipy_cil.testproblem.ParallelBeam2DProblem.get_components(\n    im_size=(128, 128),\n    det_count=128,\n    angles=np.linspace(0, np.pi, 180),\n    phantom=\"shepp-logan\"\n)\n\n# Set up Bayesian model\nx = cuqi.distribution.Gaussian(np.zeros(A.domain_dim), cov=1) # x ~ N(0, 1)\ny = cuqi.distribution.Gaussian(A@x, cov=0.05**2)              # y ~ N(Ax, 0.05^2)\n\n# Set up Bayesian Problem\nBP = cuqi.problem.BayesianProblem(y, x).set_data(y=y_data)\n\n# Sample from the posterior\nsamples = BP.sample_posterior(200)\n\n# Analyze the samples\ninfo.exactSolution.plot(); plt.title(\"Exact solution\")\ny_data.plot(); plt.title(\"Data\")\nsamples.plot_mean(); plt.title(\"Posterior mean\")\nsamples.plot_std(); plt.title(\"Posterior standard deviation\")\n```\n\nFor more examples, see the [demos](demos) folder.\n\n",
