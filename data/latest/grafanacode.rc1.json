    "description": "******\r\nReadme\r\n******\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis module aims to generate `Grafana <http://grafana.org/>`_ dashboards from Python scripts.\r\nThe module is tested with Grafana version 9. Older versions of Grafana might have another API and another JSON structure and are thus unsupported.\r\n\r\nUse Case\r\n========\r\n\r\nAccording to their website, Grafana is a web-based application to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your data no matter where itâ€™s stored.\r\nWith Grafana you can create, explore, and share all of your data through beautiful, flexible dashboards.\r\n\r\nThe configuration is done through a GUI, which is very user friendly.\r\nDeveloping a dashboard can be done via trial and error or on progressive insight.\r\nThe configurations are stored in a Sqlite3 database.\r\nThere is a basic version control and the dashboards and panels are portable via json.\r\nThe json of a dashboard or a panel can be inspected via the GUI.\r\nGrafana has a web API that can be used to interact with the installation.\r\nAlso `provisioning <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/>`_ can be used.\r\nThen the generated config files will have to be stored at the appropriate location.\r\n\r\nBut, sometimes we want more...\r\n\r\n* a robust configuration that can be backup-ed\r\n\r\n    * The database can get corruption.\r\n    * There can arise issues during upgrades.\r\n\r\n* manageable via GIT\r\n* roll-out dashboards and panels over different installations\r\n* roll-out changes easily over all panels and dashboards\r\n\r\n    * change the foreground color over all panels and all dashboards\r\n    * change a data source over all panels and all dashboards\r\n    * add a timezone offset in all queries\r\n\r\n* have a unified look and feel \r\n* have a compact notation (json files are very verbose and lengthy)\r\n\r\nSolution: Config in code\r\n\r\n* Grafana configuration in Python\r\n\r\n    * set of Python dataclasses\r\n    * supporting multiple panel types\r\n    * supporting multiple data sources\r\n    * supporting other configurations (alarming, ...)\r\n\r\n* User functions\r\n\r\n    * implement some communication via the Grafana API\r\n    * download a dashboard from a Grafana installation as json\r\n    * upload a dashboard to a Grafana installation as json\r\n    * convert a python script to uploadable json\r\n    * convert a json to a python script\r\n\r\nthe grafanacode tool\r\n====================\r\n\r\nAs already said, the configuration will be done in Python.\r\nAlthough this is all relative simple code, some knowledge of python will be useful.\r\nWe will use Python 3 with some additional libraries. Under the hood we make extensive use of the `attrs library <https://www.attrs.org>`_.\r\nIf you install it via ``pip`` (see below), these dependencies will be installed together with the tool, \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis module contains a number of functionalities:\r\n\r\n* Save one or more Grafana dashboards.\r\n* Export one or more Grafana dashboards to Python code (*).\r\n* Generate one or more Grafana dashboards.\r\n* Upload one or more Grafana dashboards to a running system.\r\n\r\n(*) The export is not complete. Some additional work needs to be done before the code can run.\r\nBut the script contains already most of the code\r\n\r\nTake a look at the included examples for more info.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce typing there is only one namespace: grafanacode.\r\nSo when in the documentation there is: ``grafanacode.plugins.panel_base.PropGridPos``, you have to type ``grafanacode.PropGridPos``. \r\nOr when you ``from grafanacode import *``, you simply type ``PropGridPos``.\r\nI know this is strongly disadvised. Nevertheless, in this case, importing the grafanacode objects in your namespace implies little risk. On the other side, t makes the code much more compact and readable, which is one of the main aims of this module.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\ngrafanacode is just a Python package, so:\r\n\r\n    .. code-block:: console\r\n\r\n        pip install grafanacode\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis library is under development.\r\nSo breaking changes are always possible.\r\n\r\ngrafanacode works with Python 3.9 and 3.10.\r\n\r\nDevelopment setup\r\n=================\r\n\r\nEvery Python development system will do, but on Windows OS, I prefer Anaconda.\r\n\r\nTo install Anaconda:\r\n\r\n* Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/; chose windows installer\r\n* Double click to install; Accept all defaults (personally I install this at another location).\r\n* Start Anaconda\r\n* Click on Anaconda Navigator\r\n* Setup a virtual environment; I called this *grafanacode*\r\n* Click on ``environments``\r\n* Click on ``create`` at the bottom\r\n* Fill in the popup; chose ``Python 3``\r\n* Select environment\r\n* Start a Command prompt\r\n    * Click on the green play button\r\n    * Chose ``open terminal``\r\n    * In the command prompt, between brackets, you can see the virtual environment you are in.\r\n* Install dependencies\r\n\r\n    .. code-block:: console\r\n\r\n        pip install attrs\r\n        pip install requests\r\n        pip install sphinx-rtd-theme\r\n        pip install sphinx-toolbox\r\n        pip install pprinter\r\n        pip install pylint\r\n        pip install docutils==0.16\r\n        pip install hypothesis\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerate dashboards\r\n===================\r\n\r\nTake a look at the example scripts. \r\n",
