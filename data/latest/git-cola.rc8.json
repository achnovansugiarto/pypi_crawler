Qt 6.0 is also supported via QtPy.\n\n* [PySide2](https://github.com/PySide/PySide)\n  5.11.0 or newer.\n\n\n## Optional Features\n\nGit Cola enables additional features when the following\nPython modules are installed.\n\n[send2trash](https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash) enables cross-platform\n\"Send to Trash\" functionality.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n**IMPORTANT**: never run `pip install` or `make install` as root or outside of a\nPython virtualenv!\n\nThere are several ways to install Git Cola.\n\n## Linux\n\nLinux is it! Your distro has probably already packaged `git-cola`.\nIf not, please file a bug against your distribution ;-)\n\n### Arch\n\nAvailable in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-cola/).\n\n### Debian, Ubuntu\n\n    apt install git-cola\n\n### Fedora\n\n    dnf install git-cola\n\n### Gentoo\n\n    emerge git-cola\n\n### OpenSUSE, SLE\n\n    zypper install git-cola\n\n### Slackware\n\nAvailable in [SlackBuilds.org](http://slackbuilds.org/result/?search=git-cola).\n\n### Ubuntu\n\n[See here](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=git-cola) for the\nversions that are available in Ubuntu's repositories.\n\nThere was a [PPA by @pavreh](https://launchpad.net/~pavreh/+archive/ubuntu/git-cola)\nbut it has not been updated for a while.\n\n\n## FreeBSD\n\n    # Install from official binary packages\n    pkg install -r FreeBSD devel/git-cola\n\n    # Build from source\n    cd /usr/ports/devel/git-cola && make clean install\n\n\n## Install into a Python Virtualenv from PyPI using pip\n\n**IMPORTANT**: never run `pip install` or `make install` as root or outside of a\nPython virtualenv!\n\nOne way to install the latest released version is to use `venv` (virtualenv) and `pip`.\nThis installs [git-cola from pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/git-cola/).\n\nIf you already have `PyQt5` installed from your distribution's package manager\nthen you should skip the `pip install PyQt` steps.\n\nIf you already have the `qt5-devel` package installed then you can lookup its version so\nthat your virtualenv can install a compatible version of PyQt using `qmake`:\n\n    QT_VERSION=$(qmake -query QT_VERSION)\n    QT_VERSION_MAJOR=$(qmake -query QT_VERSION | head -c 1)\n    echo PyQt${QT_VERSION_MAJOR}==${QT_VERSION}\n\nTake note of the `PyQtX==A.B.C` value so that you can specify it when installing\nPyQt below if, and only if, you have `qmake` installed and want to interoperate\nwith its corresponding Qt installation.\n\n    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages env3\n\n    # Skip this command if you already have PyQt installed or if you do not have qmake\n    ./env3/bin/pip install PyQt${QT_VERSION_MAJOR}==${QT_VERSION}\n\n    ./env3/bin/pip install git-cola\n    ./env3/bin/git-cola\n\nAdd the `env3/bin` directory to your `PATH` or symlink to `bin/git-cola` from\nsomewhere in your `PATH` such as `~/.local/bin/git-cola`, and you can launch\nGit Cola like any other built-in `git` command:\n\n    git cola\n    git dag\n\n\n## Install into a Python Virtualenv from Source\n\nIf you don't have PyQt installed then the easiest way to get it is to use a Python\nvirtualenv and install Git Cola into it in \"editable\" mode. This install method\nlets you upgrade Git Cola by running `git pull`.\n\n    # Create a virtualenv called \"env3\" and activate it.\n    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages env3\n    source env3/bin/activate\n\n    # One-time setup: install optional requirements for development.\n    make requirements-dev requirements-optional\n\n    # Install git-cola in \"editable\" mode so that it uses the source tree.\n    make develop\n\n    # Run Git Cola via the \"git-cola\" Git subcommand.\n    git cola\n\n\nIf you add `env3/bin` (or symlink to `bin/git-cola` ) to your `$PATH` then you can\nrun `git cola` as if it were a builtin `git` command from outside of the virtualenv\n(eg. after running \"deactivate\" or when opening a new shell).\n\n\n## Standalone Installation from Source\n\nRunning `make install prefix=$HOME/.local` will install Git Cola in your\n`$HOME/.local` directory (`$HOME/.local/bin/git-cola`, `$HOME/.local/lib`, etc).\n\nThis installation method assumes that the `qtpy` and `PyQt*` dependencies have\nbeen pre-installed.\n\nThe `Makefile` also supports `DESTDIR` to support creating packages for Linux package\nmanagers:\n\n    make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage prefix=/usr/local install\n\n\n## macOS\n\nFor most end-users we recommend using either Homebrew or installing into\na Python virtualenv as described above.\n\nYou can install Git Cola from source using the same steps as above.\n\n### Homebrew\n\nAn easy way to install Git Cola is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) .\nUse Homebrew to install the git-cola recipe:\n\n    brew install git-cola\n\nIf you install using Homebrew you can stop at this step.\nYou don't need to clone the repo or anything.\n\n### git-cola.app\n\nIf you have all of the dependencies installed, either via `pip` or `brew` then\nyou can build a shell `git-cola.app` app bundle wrapper for use in `/Applications`.\n\nIf you'd like to build a `git-cola.app` bundle for `/Applications` run this command:\n\n    make git-cola.app\n\nYou will need to periodically rebuild the app wrapper whenever Python is upgraded.\n\n### Updating macOS and Homebrew\n\nUpdating macOS can often break Homebrew-managed software.\n\nIf you upgrade your macOS version and Git Cola no longer runs then then it is\nrecommended that you re-install Git Cola's dependencies after upgrading.\n\nA quick fix when upgrading to newer versions of XCode or macOS is to\nreinstall pyqt5.\n\n    brew reinstall pyqt@5\n\nYou may also need to relink your pyqt installation:\n\n    brew link pyqt@5\n\nThis is required when upgrading to a modern (post-10.11 El Capitan) Mac OS X.\nHomebrew now bundles its own Python3 installation instead of using the\nsystem-provided default Python.\n\nIf the \"brew reinstall\" command above does not work then re-installing from\nscratch using the instructions below should get things back in shape.\n\n    # update homebrew\n    brew update\n\n    # uninstall git-cola and its dependencies\n    brew uninstall git-cola\n    brew uninstall pyqt5\n    brew uninstall sip\n\n    # re-install git-cola and its dependencies\n    brew install git-cola\n\n\n## Windows\n\nIMPORTANT If you have a 64-bit machine, install the 64-bit versions only.\nDo not mix 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\n\nDownload and install the following:\n\n* [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)\n\n* [Git Cola](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/releases)\n\nOnce these are installed you can run Git Cola from the Start menu.\n\nSee \"Windows (Continued)\" below for more details.\n\n\n# Goodies\n\nGit Cola ships with an interactive rebase editor called `git-cola-sequence-editor`.\n`git-cola-sequence-editor` is used to reorder and choose commits when rebasing.\nStart an interactive rebase through the \"Rebase\" menu, or through the\n`git cola rebase` sub-command to use the `git-cola-sequence-editor`:\n\n    git cola rebase @{upstream}\n\n`git-cola-sequence-editor` can be launched independently of git cola by telling\n`git rebase` to use it as its editor through the `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`\nenvironment variable:\n\n    export GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=\"$HOME/git-cola/bin/git-cola-sequence-editor\"\n    git rebase -i @{upstream}\n\n\n# Git Cola Sub-commands\n\nThe `git-cola` command exposes various sub-commands that allow you to quickly\nlaunch tools that are available from within the git-cola interface.\nFor example, `git cola find` launches the file finder,\nand `git cola grep` launches the grep tool.\n\nSee `git cola --help-commands` for the full list of commands.\n\n    $ git cola --help-commands\n    usage: git-cola [-h]\n    \n                    {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,config,\n                     dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,\n                     rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}\n                    ...\n    \n    valid commands:\n      {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,config,\n       dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,\n       rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}\n\n        cola                start git-cola\n        am                  apply patches using \"git am\"\n        archive             save an archive\n        branch              create a branch\n        browse              browse repository\n        config              edit configuration\n        dag                 start git-dag\n        diff                view diffs\n        fetch               fetch remotes\n        find                find files\n        grep                grep source\n        merge               merge branches\n        pull                pull remote branches\n        push                push remote branches\n        rebase              interactive rebase\n        remote              edit remotes\n        search              search commits\n        stash               stash and unstash changes\n        tag                 create tags\n        version             print the version\n\n## Development\n\nIf you already have Git Cola's dependencies installed then you can \nstart `cola` as a Python module if you have the source code available.\n\n    python -m cola\n    python -m cola dag\n\n\nThe following commands should be run during development:\n\n    # Run the unit tests\n    $ make test\n\n    # Run tests and longer-running pylint and flake8 checks\n    $ make check\n\n    # Run tests against multiple python interpreters using tox\n    $ make tox\n\nThe test suite can be found in the [test](test) directory.\n\nCommits and pull requests are automatically tested for code quality\nusing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/actions/workflows/main.yml).\n\nAuto-format `cola/i18n/*.po` files before committing when updating translations:\n\n    $ make po\n\nWhen submitting patches, consult the\n[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Packaging Notes\n\nGit Cola installs its modules into the default Python site-packages directory\n(eg. `lib/python3.7/site-packages`) using setuptools.\n\nWhile end-users can use `pip install git-cola` to install Git Cola, distribution\npackagers should use the `make prefix=/usr` install process. Git Cola's `Makefile` wraps\n`pip install --prefix=<prefix>` to provide a packaging-friendly `make install` target.\n\n\n# Windows (Continued)\n\n## Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable\n\nEarlier versions of Git Cola may have shipped without `vcruntime140.dll`  and may\nnot run on machines that are missing this DLL.\n\nTo fix this, download the\n[Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685)\nand install it\n\nGit Cola v4.0.0 and newer include this DLL and do not require this to be installed\nseparately.\n\n## Development\n\nIn order to develop Git Cola on Windows you will need to install\nPython3 and pip.  Install PyQt5 using `pip install PyQt5`\nto make the PyQt5 bindings available to Python.\n\nOnce these are installed you can use `python.exe` to run\ndirectly from the source tree.  For example, from a Git Bash terminal:\n\n    /c/Python36/python.exe ./bin/git-cola\n\n## Multiple Python versions\n\nIf you have multiple versions of Python installed, the `contrib/win32/cola`\nlauncher script might choose the newer version instead of the python\nthat has PyQt installed.  In order to resolve this, you can set the\n`cola.pythonlocation` git configuration variable to tell cola where to\nfind python.  For example:\n\n    git config --global cola.pythonlocation /c/Python39\n\n## Building Windows Installers\n\nWindows installers are built using\n\n* [Pynsist](https://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is also needed.\n\nTo build the installer using Pynsist run:\n\n    ./contrib/win32/run-pynsist.sh\n\nThis will generate an installer in `build/nsis/`.\n\n## Windows \"History Browser\" Configuration Upgrade\n\nYou may need to configure your history browser if you are upgrading from an\nolder version of Git Cola on Windows.\n\n`gitk` was originally the default history browser, but `gitk` cannot be\nlaunched as-is on Windows because `gitk` is a shell script.\n\nIf you are configured to use `gitk`, then change your configuration to\ngo through Git's `sh.exe` on Windows.  Similarly, we must go through\n`python.exe` if we want to use `git-dag`.\n\nIf you want to use gitk as your history browser open the\nPreferences screen and change the history browser command to:\n\n    \"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/sh.exe\" --login -i C:/Git/bin/gitk\n\n`git-dag` became the default history browser on Windows in `v2.3`, so new\nusers do not need to configure anything.\n",

    "license": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. ",
