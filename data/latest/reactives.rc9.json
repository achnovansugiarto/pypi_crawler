A reactive\ncan be *triggered* (`reactive.react.trigger()`), causing all its *reactors* to be called. A *reactor* is any callable\nthat takes no arguments, and you add it to a reactive via `reactive.react(reactor)`. When a reactive is triggered,\nits reactors and its reactors' reactors are resolved, and each is called once in order.\n\n**Reactives** uses a push-pull approach, meaning change notifications are pushed (reactors are called automatically and\nwon't have to pull for changes), but if a reactor needs to know what exactly changed, it must pull this information\nitself.\n\n## Usage\nFor any type to be reactive, it must extend `reactives.factory.Reactive` and set a `reactives.ReactorController`\ninstance in its `__init__()` method. For any of the types supported by default, you only have to decorate your type or\nvalue with `@reactives.reactive`. Additionally, some classes are provided that are reactive and can be instantiated or\ninherited from directly.\n\n### Custom classes\nDecorate a class to make its individual instances reactive:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    pass\n\napple = Apple()\napple.react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))\napple.react.trigger()\n# >>> \"The apple got triggered!\"\n```\n\n### Functions and methods \nDecorate a function:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\ndef apple():\n    pass\n\napple.react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))\napple.react.trigger()\n# >>> \"The apple got triggered!\"\n```\n\nDecorate a method on a **reactive class**:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    @reactive\n    def apple(self):\n        pass\n\napple = Apple()\napple.react['apple'].react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))\napple.react['apple'].react.trigger()\n# >>> \"The apple got triggered!\"\n```\nReactive methods must be accessed through their instance, because `Apple.apple` would yield the class method.\n\nBoth functions and methods can be called automatically when they're triggered. This lets them set up something once, and\nupdate that thing when they're triggered:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive(on_trigger_call=True)\ndef warm_caches():\n    \"\"\"\n    Warm the application's caches. When triggered (because the cached data has changed), re-warm the caches.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n```\n\n### Properties\nDecorate a property:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    @reactive\n    @property\n    def apple(self) -> str:\n        return 'I got you something!'\n\napple = Apple()\napple.react['apple'].react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))\napple.react['apple'].react.trigger()\n# >>> \"The apple got triggered!\"\n```\n\nIf a property *deleter* is present, it will be called automatically when the property is triggered:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._cached_something = None\n\n    @reactive\n    @property\n    def apple(self) -> str:\n        if self._cached_something is None:\n            self._cached_something = 'I got you something!'\n        return self._cached_something\n\n    @apple.deleter\n    def apple(self)  -> None:\n        self._cached_something = 'I got you nothing!'\n\napple = Apple()\nprint(apple.apple)\n# >>> \"I got you something!\"\napple.react['apple'].react().trigger()\nprint(apple.apple)\n# >>> \"I got you nothing!\"\n```\n\nIf you do not want automatic deletion, configure the property's `@reactive` decorator as such:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._cached_something = None\n\n    @reactive(on_trigger_delete=False)\n    @property\n    def apple(self) -> str:\n        if self._cached_something is None:\n            self._cached_something = 'I got you something!'\n        return self._cached_something\n\n    @apple.deleter\n    def apple(self)  -> None:\n        self._cached_something = 'I got you nothing!'\n\napple = Apple()\nprint(apple.apple)\n# >>> \"I got you something!\"\napple.react['apple'].react().trigger()\nprint(apple.apple)\n# >>> \"I got you something!\"\n```\n\nProperty *setters* work exactly like with any other `property`:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._something = 'I got you something!'\n        \n    @reactive\n    @property\n    def apple(self) -> str:\n        return self._something\n    \n    @apple.setter\n    def apple(self, something: str):\n        self._something = something\n\napple = Apple()\napple.react['apple'].react(lambda: print('The apple got triggered!'))\napple.apple = 'I got you something else!'\n# >>> \"The apple got triggered!\"\n```\n\nValues set through a property may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the property and the value are autowired, \nwhich means that the property becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is triggered,\nso is the property. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values a property might have, all you\nneed to do is add your reactor to the property.\n\n*Getters* that perform conditional logic, such as for cached properties, can take over reactive scope dependency\ncollection for more fine-grained reactivity control:\n```python\nfrom reactives import reactive, scope\n\n@reactive\nclass Apple:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._cached_something = None\n\n    @reactive(auto_collect_scope=False)\n    @property\n    def apple(self) -> str:\n        if self._cached_something is None:\n            with scope.collect(self.react['apple']):\n                self._cached_something = build_something()\n        return self._cached_something\n\ndef build_something():\n    pass\n```\n\n### Lists\n`ReactiveList` is a reactive version of Python's built-in `list`. You can use it in exactly the same way as `list`:\n```python\nfrom reactives import ReactiveList\n\nfruits = ReactiveList(['apple', 'banana'])\nfruits.react(lambda: print('Look at all these delicious fruits!'))\nfruits.append('orange')\n# >>> \"Look at all these delicious fruits!\"\n```\n\nValues added to a `ReactiveList` may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the list and the value are autowired, \nwhich means that the list becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is triggered,\nso is the list. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values in a `ReactiveList`, all you\nneed to do is add your reactor to the list.\n\n### Dictionaries\n`ReactiveDict` is a reactive version of Python's built-in `dict`. You can use it in exactly the same way as `dict`:\n```python\nfrom reactives import ReactiveDict\n\nfruits = ReactiveDict(apple=5, banana=2)\nfruits.react(lambda: print('Look at all these delicious fruits!'))\nfruits['orange'] = 4\n# >>> \"Look at all these delicious fruits!\"\n```\n\nValues added to a `ReactiveDict` may themselves be reactive too. If they are, the dictionary and the value are\nautowired, which means that the dictionary becomes a reactor to the newly added value. As soon as the value is\ntriggered, so is the dictionary. Therefore, if you want to react to any change to any of the values in a `ReactiveDict`, \nall you  need to do is add your reactor to the dictionary.\n\n### Autowiring\nWe've seen how [properties](#Properties), [lists](#Lists), and [dictionaries](#Dictionaries) autowire themselves to\ntheir values. This is possible because properties, lists, and dictionaries know exactly which values move in and out of\nthem. In other cases, we use *scope*. Any reactive can start a scope with `reactives.scope.collect()` and collect all\nreactives that are called or used during that scope window, and autowire itself to them. Conversely, any reactive can\nregister itself with the current scope (if there is one) with `reactives.scope.register*()`, and allow reactives\ndepending on it to autowire themselves. In fact, this is what properties do internally.\n\nAutowiring means that as a developer, you won't need to worry about connecting the parts of your application most of the\ntime.\n\n## Development\nFirst, [fork and clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository, and navigate to its root directory.\n\n### Requirements\n- Bash (you're all good if `which bash` outputs a path in your terminal)\n\n### Installation\nIf you have [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) installed on your machine, `tox --develop` will create the necessary\nvirtual environments and install all development dependencies. \n\nAlternatively, in any existing Python environment, run `./bin/build-dev`.\n\n### Testing\nIn any existing Python environment, run `./bin/test`.\n\n### Fixing problems automatically\nIn any existing Python environment, run `./bin/fix`.\n\n## Contributions 🥳\nReactives is Free and Open Source Software. As such you are welcome to\n[report bugs](https://github.com/bartfeenstra/reactives/issues) or\n[submit improvements](https://github.com/bartfeenstra/reactives/pulls).\n\n## Copyright & license\nReactives is copyright [Bart Feenstra](https://twitter.com/BartFeenstra/) and contributors, and released under the\n[GNU General Public License, Version 3](./LICENSE.txt).
