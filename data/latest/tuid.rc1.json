Limitations on Grant Scope\r\n\t\r\n\tThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\r\n\tthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\r\n\tdistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\r\n\tNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\r\n\tContributor:\r\n\t\r\n\t(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\r\n\t    or\r\n\t\r\n\t(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\r\n\t    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\r\n\t    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\r\n\t    Version); or\r\n\t\r\n\t(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\r\n\t    its Contributions.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\r\n\tor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\r\n\tthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\r\n\t\r\n\t2.4. Subsequent Licenses\r\n\t\r\n\tNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\r\n\tdistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\r\n\tLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\r\n\tpermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\r\n\t\r\n\t2.5.

Fair Use\r\n\t\r\n\tThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\r\n\tapplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\r\n\tequivalents.\r\n\t\r\n\t2.7. Conditions\r\n\t\r\n\tSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\r\n\tin Section 2.1.\r\n\t\r\n\t3. Responsibilities\r\n\t-------------------\r\n\t\r\n\t3.1. Distribution of Source Form\r\n\t\r\n\tAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\r\n\tModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\r\n\tthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\r\n\tCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\r\n\tLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\r\n\tattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\r\n\tForm.\r\n\t\r\n\t3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\r\n\t\r\n\tIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\r\n\t\r\n\t(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\r\n\t    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\r\n\t    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\r\n\t    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\r\n\t    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\r\n\t\r\n\t(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\r\n\t    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\r\n\t    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\r\n\t    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\r\n\t\r\n\t3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\r\n\tprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\r\n\tthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\r\n\tSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\r\n\tCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\r\n\tLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\r\n\tunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\r\n\tthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\r\n\tSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\r\n\tLicense(s).\r\n\t\r\n\t3.4. Notices\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\r\n\t(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\r\n\tor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\r\n\tthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\r\n\tthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\r\n\t\r\n\t3.5. Application of Additional Terms\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\r\n\tindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\r\n\tSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\r\n\tbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\r\n\tsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\r\n\tYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\r\n\tliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\r\n\tindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\r\n\tdisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\r\n\tjurisdiction.\r\n\t\r\n\t4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\r\n\t---------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\r\n\tIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\n\tLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\r\n\tstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\r\n\tthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\r\n\tdescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\r\n\tbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\r\n\tSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\r\n\tor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\r\n\trecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\t\r\n\t5. Termination\r\n\t--------------\r\n\t\r\n\t5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\r\n\tif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\r\n\tcompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\r\n\tContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\r\n\tContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\r\n\tongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\r\n\tnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\r\n\tcome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\r\n\tContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\r\n\tnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\r\n\tfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\r\n\tfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\r\n\tYour receipt of the notice.\r\n\t\r\n\t5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\r\n\tinfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\r\n\tcounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\r\n\tdirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\r\n\tYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\r\n\t2.1 of this License shall terminate.\r\n\t\r\n\t5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\r\n\tend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\r\n\thave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\r\n\tprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\t\r\n\t************************************************************************\r\n\t*                                                                      *\r\n\t*  6.

Litigation\r\n\t-------------\r\n\t\r\n\tAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\r\n\tcourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\r\n\tplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\r\n\tjurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\r\n\tNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\r\n\tcross-claims or counter-claims.\r\n\t\r\n\t9.

Any law or regulation which provides\r\n\tthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\r\n\tshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\r\n\t\r\n\t10.
