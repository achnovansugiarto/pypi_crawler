    "description": "# CUQIpy-PyTorch\n\nCUQIpy-PyTorch is a plugin for the [CUQIpy](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) software package.\n\nIt adds a PyTorch backend to CUQIpy, allowing the user to use the PyTorch API to define models, distributions etc.\n\nIt also links to the [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) No U-Turn Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler (NUTS) for efficient sampling from the joint posterior.\n\n## Installation\nFor optimal performance consider installing [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) using conda, then install CUQIpy-PyTorch using pip:\n```bash\npip install cuqipy-pytorch\n```\nIf PyTorch, Pyro or CUQIpy are not installed, they will be installed automatically from the above command.\n\n## Quickstart\nExample for sampling from the [eight schools model](https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/blob/master/notebooks/eight_schools.ipynb):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\mu &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10^2)\\\\\n    \\tau &\\sim \\log\\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\\\\n    \\boldsymbol \\theta' &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_m)\\\\\n    \\boldsymbol \\theta &= \\mu + \\tau \\boldsymbol \\theta'\\\\\n    \\mathbf{y} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol \\theta, \\boldsymbol \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}_m)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\\boldsymbol \\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ are observed data.\n\n```python\nimport torch as xp\nfrom cuqi.distribution import JointDistribution\nfrom cuqipy_pytorch.distribution import Gaussian, LogGaussian\nfrom cuqipy_pytorch.sampler import NUTS\n\n# Observations\ny_obs = xp.tensor([28, 8, -3,  7, -1, 1,  18, 12], dtype=xp.float32)\nσ_obs = xp.tensor([15, 10, 16, 11, 9, 11, 10, 18], dtype=xp.float32)\n\n# Bayesian model\nμ     = Gaussian(0, 10**2)\nτ     = LogGaussian(5, 1)\nθp    = Gaussian(xp.zeros(8), 1)\nθ     = lambda μ, τ, θp: μ+τ*θp\ny     = Gaussian(θ, cov=σ_obs**2)\n\n# Posterior sampling\njoint = JointDistribution(μ, τ, θp, y)   # Define joint distribution \nposterior = joint(y=y_obs)               # Define posterior distribution\nsampler = NUTS(posterior)                # Define sampling strategy\nsamples = sampler.sample(N=500, Nb=500)  # Sample from posterior\n\n# Plot posterior samples\nsamples[\"θp\"].plot_violin(); \nprint(samples[\"μ\"].mean()) # Average effect\nprint(samples[\"τ\"].mean()) # Average variance\n```\n\nFor more examples, see the [demos](demos) folder.\n\n",
