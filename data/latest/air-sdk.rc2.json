    "description": "# air_sdk\n\nThis project provides a Python SDK for interacting with the NVIDIA Air API (https://air.nvidia.com/api/).\n\n[Click here for the full documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/guides/nvidia-air/Air-Python-SDK/)\n\n## Prerequisite\n\nThe SDK requires python 3.7 or later. The safest way to install the SDK is to set up a virtual environment in python3.7:\n\n```\napt-get install python3.7\n```\n\n```\npython3.7 -m pip install virtualenv\n```\n\n```\npython3.7 -m virtualenv venv37\n```\n\n```\n. venv37/bin/activate\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the SDK, use pip:\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install air-sdk\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n>>> from air_sdk import AirApi\n>>> air = AirApi(username='<user>', password='<password>')\n```\n\n## Authentication Options\n\nUsing the API requires the use of either an API token, a username/password, or a bearer token.\n\n### API token\n\nTo use an API token, one must first be generated. The easiest way to do this is via the [Air UI](https://air.nvidia.com/settings/api-tokens).\n\nOnce a token is generated:\n\n```\n>>> air = AirApi(username='<username>', password='<api_token>')\n```\n\n### Username/Password\n\nTo use a username/password, an administrator of NVIDIA Air must provision a service account. Once the administrator provides the username and password:\n\n```\n>>> air = AirApi(username='<username>', password='<password>')\n```\n\n### Bearer token\n\nGenerally, it's recommended to use an [API Token](#api-token) over a bearer token. However, a bearer token might be used for testing or quick-and-dirty operations that might not need a long term API token. To use a bearer token, the calling user must have a nvidia.com account and have previously approved access for NVIDIA Air. Once a token is obtained:\n\n```\n>>> air = AirApi(bearer_token='<bearer_token>')\n```\n\n### Interacting with the API\n\nThe SDK provides various helper methods for interacting with the API. For example:\n\n```\n>>> air.simulations.list()\n[<Simulation sim1 c51b49b6-94a7-4c93-950c-e7fa4883591>, <Simulation sim2 3134711d-015e-49fb-a6ca-68248a8d4aff>]\n>>> sim1 = air.simulations.get('c51b49b6-94a7-4c93-950c-e7fa4883591')\n>>> sim1.title = 'My Sim'\n>>> sim1.store()\n```\n\n## Developing\n\nContributions to the SDK are very welcome. All code must pass linting and unit testing before it will be merged.\n\n### Requirements\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\n### Linting\n\n```\npylint **/*.py\n```\n\n### Unit testing\n\n```\n./unit_test.sh\n```\n",
