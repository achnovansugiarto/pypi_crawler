    "description": "# tfmplus\n### Python module for the Benewake TFMini-Plus Lidar sensor\n\nThe **TFMini-Plus** is largely compatible with the **TFMini-S**, which is able to use this module.  One difference is that upon command to change communication mode (`SET_I2C_MODE`, `SET_SERIAL_MODE`) the **TFMini-Plus** switches immediately, whereas the **TFMini-S** requires an additional `SAVE_SETTING` command.  This module is *not compatible* with the **TFMini**, which is an entirely different product with its own command set and data structure.\n\nWith hardware v1.3.5 and firmware v1.9.0 and above, the TFMini-Plus communication interface can be configured to use either the default **UART** (serial) or the **I2C** (two-wire) protocol.  Additionaly, the device can be configured to output a binary (high/low) voltage level to signal that a detected object is within or beyond a user-defined range.  Please see the manufacturer's Product Manual in `docs` for more information about the **I/O** output mode.\n\nThe UART serial baud-rate is user-programmable, but only the following rates are supported:\n</br>9600, 14400, 19200, 56000, 115200, 460800, and 921600.<br>\n\nDevice data-frame output rates are programmable up to 10KHz, but the internal measuring frame-rate is fixed at 4KHz.\n<br />\"Standard\" output rates are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, and 1000Hz.\n<br />If the output rate is set to 0 (zero), single data frames can be triggered by using the `TRIGGER_DETECTION` command.\n\nThree measurement values are returned by the device:\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp;  Distance to target in centimeters/millimeters. Range: 0 - 1200/12000\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp;  Strength (voltage) or quality of returned signal in arbitrary units. Range: -1, 0 - 32767\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp;  Temperature of the device in code. Range: -25°C to 125°C\n\nThe default TFMini-Plus communication interface is UART (serial); the default baud-rate is 115200 and the default data frame-rate is 100Hz.  Upon power-up in serial mode, the device will immediately start sending asynchronous frames of measurement data at the frame-rate.\n\nThis module supports **only** the default, UART (serial) communication interface.  For communication in I2C mode, please install and import the TFMini-Plus-I2C module, `tfmpi2c`.  Read more below about using the I2C mode of the device.\n<hr />\n\n### Three `tfmplus` module functions\nThe three module functions are all defined in the main module file, `__init__.py` along with parameters, commands and status codes.\n\n`begin( port, rate)` passes the serial port name and baud rate of the host device to the module and returns a boolean value indicating whether serial data is available. The function also sets a public one-byte `status` or error code.\n\n`getData()` reads a serial data frame from the device and extracts the three measuremnent data values.  It sets the `status` error code byte and returns a boolean value indicating 'pass/fail'.  If no serial data is received or no header sequence \\[`0x5959`\\] is detected within one (1) second, the function sets an appropriate `status` error code and 'fails'.  Given the asynchronous nature of the device, the serial buffer is flushed before reading and the `frame` and `reply` data arrays are zeroed out to delete any residual data.  This helps with valid data recognition and error discrimination.\n\n`sendCommand( cmnd, param)` sends a coded command and a coded parameter to the device.  It sets the `status` error code byte and returns a boolean 'pass/fail' value.  A proper command (`cmnd`) must be selected from the module's list of twenty defined commands.  A parameter (`param`) may be entered directly as an unsigned number, but it is better to choose from the module's defined parameters because **an erroneous parameter can block communication and there is no external means of resetting the device to factory defaults.**\n\nAny change of device settings (i.e. frame-rate or baud-rate) must be followed by a `SAVE_SETTINGS` command or else the modified values may be lost when power is removed.  `SYSTEM_RESET` and `RESTORE_FACTORY_SETTINGS` do not require a `SAVE_SETTINGS` command.\n\nBenewake is not forthcoming about the internals of the device, however they did share this:\n>Some commands that modify internal parameters are processed within 1ms.  Some commands require the MCU to communicate with other chips may take several ms.  And some commands, such as saving configuration and restoring the factory need to erase the FLASH of the MCU, which may take several hundred ms.\n\nAlso included:\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; A python script 'tfmp_test.py' is in `tests`.\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; Recent copies of the manufacturer's Datasheet and Product Manual are in `docs`.\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; Valuable information regarding Time of Flight distance sensing in general and the Texas   Instruments OPT3101 module in particular are also in `docs`.\n\nAll of the code for this module is richly commented to assist with understanding and in problem solving.\n\n### Using the I2C version of the device\nAccording to Benewake:\n>1- the measuring frequency of the module should be 2.5 times larger than the IIC reading frquency.\n<br />2- the iic reading frequency should not exceed 100hz<br />\n\nBecause the Data Frame Rate is limited to 1000Hz, this condition implys a 400Hz data sampling limit in I2C mode.  Benewake says sampling should not exceed 100Hz.  They don't say why; but you might keep that limitation in mind when you consider using the I2C interface.\n\nTo configure the device for I2C communication, a command must be sent using the UART inteface.  Therefore, this reconfiguation should be made prior to the device's service installation, either by using this module's `SET_I2C_MODE` command or the serial GUI test application and code supplied by the manufacturer.\n\nThe `SET_I2C_MODE` command does not require a subsequent `SAVE_SETTINGS` command.  The device will remain in I2C mode after power has been removed and restored.  The only way to return to serial mode is with the `SET_SERIAL_MODE` command.  Even a `RESTORE_FACTORY_SETTINGS` command will NOT restore the device to its default, UART communication interface mode.\n\nThe device functions as an I2C slave device and the default address is `16` (`0x10` Hex) but is user-programable by sending the `SET_I2C_ADDRESS` command and a parameter in the range of `1` to `127`.  The new setting will take effect immediately and permanently without a `SAVE_SETTINGS` command, however the `RESTORE_FACTORY_SETTINGS` command will restore the default address.  The I2C address can be set while still in serial communication mode or, if in I2C mode, an example script included in the TFMini-Plus-I2C module can be used to test and change the address.\n\n### Using the I/O modes of the device\nThe so-called I/O modes are not supported in this module.  Please do not attempt to use any I/O commands that you may find to be defined in this module's header file.\n\n\n",
