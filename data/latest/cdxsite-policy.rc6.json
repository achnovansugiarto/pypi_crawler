    "description": "**************\ncdxsite.policy\n**************\n\nThis is the policy product for the home website of Climate Data Exchange\n(CDX_), a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL_), operated by the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech_) on behalf of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA_).\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to turn an ordinary Plone_ website into the CDX\nwebsite, providing the home, software distribution, and data portal for\nclimate data.\n\n.. References:\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _CDX: http://cdx.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _Caltech: http://www.caltech.edu/\n.. _NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n\n\ncdxsite.policy Installation\n===========================\n\nUse zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance:\n\n* Add ``cdxsite.policy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        cdxsite.policy\n        \n* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n  \n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    ...\n    zcml =\n        cdxsite.policy\n        \n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    $ ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n2.0.1 - 2011.8.2 - Raiders of the Lost Documents\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis release improves the upgrade process.\n\n\n2.0.0 - 2011.6.27 - Speedy\n--------------------------\n\nThis release of the CDX policy makes it work on Plone 4.  And now it's\ninsanely fast!\n\n\n1.0.1 - 2009.12.16 - Dependency Repairs\n---------------------------------------\n\n* This project failed to declare its dependencies, meaning that its dependent\n  eggs had to be present in the Python path.  This release fixes this problem\n  by listing all dependent eggs.\n\n* Project metadata has been updated that collects all related cdxsite\n  deliverables in one convenient location.\n\n\n1.0.0 - FCS\n-----------\n\nInitial release.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Unreleased\n------------------\n\nNot yet released.\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright 2008-2011 by the California Institute of Technology.
