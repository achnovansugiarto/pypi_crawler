    "description": "=================================================\nRadiovy -- Internet Radio Player on kivy GUI\n=================================================\n\nIntroduction\n----------------------\nThis project is a sub project of my 'homekeepi' project, in which I'm\nplanning to support several functions to help my family to do house\nkeeping works, also to provide a few entertainment things.\n\nPlaying Internet radio stations is one of them.  It is not a big deal,\nonce we have a URL to play.  But how to collect URLs and select one to\nplay is not so trivial.  Basically the following steps must be done.\n\n1. go to a public Internet radio station site\n2. download pages which include radio stations URL\n3. for playlist URL, go to the playlist site and download it\n4. from the playlist get a streaming URL\n5. repeat 2 to 4, and organize the URLs in a database\n6. Let users select one of the URLs\n7. Play/Stop the selected URL\n\nI've found 'https://www.internet-radio.com/' is the best place to\ncollect URLs, and supported the above functions by accessing that\nsite.\n\ngetradiourl.py\n----------------------\nThis program does '1' to '5' in the list above.\n'ZODB' is used as the database to save URLs\n\ngstplayer.py\n----------------------\nThis program does '7' in the list above.\ngstreamer is used to play radio station streams.\n\nradiovy.py\n----------------------\nThis program does '6' in the list above.\nIt runs on kivy, and is targeted to show GUI on 800x480 Raspberry Pi\ntouch screen panel.\n\ninstallation\n----------------------\nIf Kivy 1.10 is available, this package must be instllable and runnable.\nI've tested on 'KivyPie Version 1.0' and Mint Linux 18.2.\n\n  $ sudo pip install radiovy\n\nThe installation should be completed by this command.\n  \nconfiguration\n----------------------\nIn 'hkbase' directory under the installed directory, there is\n'config.cfg' file, which includes all configurable values.  Simple\nexplanation is there and changing the configurations must be straight\nforward.\n\nIf you put 'config.cfg' in '~/.getradiourl', which becomes a primary\nconfig file, and the above mentioned file becomes a secondary file.\n\nHow to use\n----------------------\nRun 'radiovy' from a console.\nAt the fist run, it downloads genres information automatically, so it\ntakes a while to start up the first screen.  Once the genres\ninformation is ready, it shows a top page of 'radiovy'.\n\n.. image:: radiovy/files/radiovy_top.png\n   :scale: 50%\n\nHitting 'genres' button, shows a genre-list page. Each genre name is a\nbutton to go inside the genre.\n\n.. image:: radiovy/files/radiovy_genres.png\n   :scale: 50%\n\nSelecting a genre, a modal dialog box shows up and ask you if you want\nto update stations information.  Because of the first run, there is\nnot any stations information, it can't show stations information page\nwithout downloading it.\n\n.. image:: radiovy/files/radiovy_stations_update.png\n   :scale: 50%\n\nClicking on 'Update Stations', it changes the button color and freezes for\na while. How log it is depends on which genre you selected. A big genre\nlike 'pop' takes quite a long time.\n\nThere is another button on the modal dialogue box, which is 'Update\nAll' button.  Hitting this button downloads all stations information\nfor all the genres.  It takes a few hours, but if you had done it, you\nwouldn't have to wait to select any genre on the screen.\n\nOnce the stations information is ready, the button color returns to the\noriginal color, and hitting 'Done' button, it returns to the genre-list page.\n\nNow, it can go ahead to show stations list for the selected genre.\nIt shows the next kind of station-list page.\n\n.. image:: radiovy/files/radiovy_stations_list.png\n   :scale: 50%\n\nThe stations list is on a scroll window, with the default\nconfiguration, it shows up to 80 stations in a scroll window, and\npaginate into multiple pages when there are more stations.\n\nHitting one station, it starts playing the station.  Hitting again, it\nstops playing.\n\nThere are 'mark this genre' button and 'mark playing station' button,\nhitting those buttons makes the selected genre or the playing station\nis put at earlier position in the list.\n\n",
