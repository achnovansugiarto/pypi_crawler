    "description": "# DESC_BPZ: \n\nThis repo contains a python3 port of the popular BPZ software package (https://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/).  The code was modified from the original bpz-1.99.3 version available at the given URL, upgraded to be python3 compatible, and modified to read and write hdf5 files rather than straight ascii.  The code is messy in many places, having gone through multiple iterations by multiple authors.  No promises are made as to functionality of multiple subsystems (e.g. plotting), so use with caution!\n\nIf you use this code, please cite [Benitez (2000)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...536..571B/abstract) and [Coe et al. (2006)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132..926C/abstract).\n\nIn order to run, you should set the environment variable\n\n\n`BPZDATAPATH` to point to the directory housing the SED, FILTER, and AB files.  Default SED and FILTER files are available in the\n`src/desc_bpz/data_files/FILTER` and `src/desc_bpz/data_files/SED` directories\n\n\nTo run traditional command-line `BPZ` use the `bpz.py` file in `src/desc_bpz/scripts`, e.g.:\n\n\n`python src/desc_bpz/scripts/bpz.py yourasciicatalog.cat -P yourparameterfile.pars`\n\n\nDan Coe's STScI webpage (listed above) contains a nice BPZ user guide, for more detail on running the code, please check that website.\n\n\nHowever, this package will mainly be used as a library for running \"bpz_lite\" in the DESC PZ RAIL Package, see:\n\nhttps://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL\n",
