This is because in such\ncases with this setting Puppet will just use a cached working catalog and report the run to PuppetDB as successful.\n(Although with an error visible in the Puppet run log.)\n\nTherefore, to show the nodes with a catalog compilation as failed in Puppetboard you need to set\n`usecacheonfailure = false` in your nodes' `puppet.conf`.\n\n### PuppetDB\n\nOf course you need to configure your Puppet Server to store the Puppet run reports in PuppetDB.\nIf you haven't done that already please follow the [PuppetDB documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/connect_puppet_server.html)\nabout this.\n\nIf you run Puppetboard on a different host than PuppetDB then you may want to configure the certificate\nallow-list for which certificates are allowed to access data from PuppetDB.\nPlease read more about this feature in the [PuppetDB documentation here](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/configure.html#certificate-allowlist).\n\n### App settings\n\nPuppetboard will look for a file pointed at by the `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` environment variable.\nThe file has to be identical to\n[default_settings.py](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/blob/master/puppetboard/default_settings.py)\nbut should only override the settings you need changed.\n\nIf you run PuppetDB and Puppetboard on the same machine the default settings provided will be enough to get you started\nand you won't need a custom settings file.\n\nAssuming your webserver and PuppetDB machine are not identical you will at least have to change the following settings:\n\n-   `PUPPETDB_HOST`\n-   `PUPPETDB_PORT`\n\nBy default PuppetDB requires SSL to be used when a non-local client wants to connect. Therefore you'll also have to\nsupply the following settings:\n\n-   `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY = /path/to/ca/keyfile.pem`\n-   `PUPPETDB_KEY = /path/to/private/keyfile.pem`\n-   `PUPPETDB_CERT = /path/to/public/keyfile.crt`\n\nWhen using the Puppetboard Docker image, you may also pass Puppetboard it's certificate contents via these environment\nvariables, either as a multiline string or pre-base64 encoded. This can be useful where the certificate is stored in a\nsecrets store i.e. AWS SSM Parameter Store.\n\n```\nPUPPETDB_CERT=\"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n```\n\n```\nPUPPETDB_CERT=LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQouLi4KLS0tLS1FTkQgQ0VSVElGSUNBVEUtLS0tLQ==\n```\n\nFor information about how to generate the correct keys please refer to the\n[pypuppetdb documentation](https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting.html#ssl). Alternatively it is possible\nto explicitly specify the protocol to be used setting the `PUPPETDB_PROTO` variable.\n\nOther settings that might be interesting, in no particular order:\n\n- `FAVORITE_ENVS`: an ordered list of Puppet environment names that will be shown immediately after \"All Environments\"\n    and before other environments (which are sorted by name) in the dropdown for choosing the environment shown\n    in the top-right of the UI. Environments listed here that do not really exist in your deployment are silently ignored.\n- `SHOW_ERROR_AS`: `friendly` or `raw`. The former makes Puppet run errors in Report and Failures views shown\n    in a modified, (arguably) more user-friendly form. The latter shows them as they are.\n    Defaults to `friendly`.\n- `CODE_PREFIX_TO_REMOVE`: what code path that should be shortened in \"Friendly errors\" to \"…\" for readability.\n    A regexp. Defaults to `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments(/.*?/modules)?`.\n- `SECRET_KEY`: Refer to [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/#sessions),\n    section \"How to generate good secret keys\" for more info. Defaults to a random 64-char string generated by `secrets.token_hex(32)`, prepended with a `default-` string. **Warning** Leaving SECRET_KEY set to a default value WILL cause issues when the app is restarted or has more than 1 replica (f.e. uWSGI workers, k8s replicas etc.) and some features (in particular: queries) are used. Please set SECRET_KEY to your own value, the same for all app replicas. This will be REQUIRED starting with Puppetboard 5.x which will NOT contain the default value anymore. Please see [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721) for more info.\n- `PUPPETDB_TIMEOUT`: Defaults to 20 seconds, but you might need to increase this value. It depends on how big the\n    results are when querying PuppetDB. This behaviour will change in a future release when pagination will be introduced.\n- `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS`: The amount of hours since the last check-in after which a node is considered unresponsive.\n- `LOGLEVEL`: A string representing the loglevel. It defaults to `'info'` but can be changed to `'warning'` or\n    `'critical'` for less verbose logging or `'debug'` for more information.\n- `ENABLE_QUERY`: Defaults to `True` causing a Query tab to show up in the web interface allowing users to write\n    and execute arbitrary queries against a set of endpoints in PuppetDB. Change this to `False` to disable this.\n    See `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS` to fine-tune which endpoints are allowed.\n- `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS`: If `ENABLE_QUERY` is `True`, allow to fine tune the endpoints of PuppetDB APIs that\n    can be queried. It must be a list of strings of PuppetDB endpoints for which the query is enabled.\n    See the `QUERY_ENDPOINTS` constant in the `puppetboard.app` module for a list of the available endpoints.\n- `GRAPH_TYPE`: Specify the type of graph to display.   Default is\n    pie, other good option is donut.   Other choices can be found here:\n    \\_C3JS\\_documentation\\`\n- `GRAPH_FACTS`: A list of fact names to tell PuppetBoard to generate a pie-chart on the fact page. With some fact\n    values being unique per node, like ipaddress, uuid, and serial number, as well as structured facts it was no longer\n    feasible to generate a graph for everything.\n- `INVENTORY_FACTS`: A list of tuples that serve as the column header and the fact name to search for to create\n    the inventory page. If a fact is not found for a node then `undef` is printed.\n- `INVENTORY_FACT_TEMPLATES`: A mapping between fact name and jinja template to customize display\n- `ENABLE_CATALOG`: If set to `True` allows the user to view a node's latest catalog. This includes all managed\n    resources, their file-system locations and their relationships, if available. Defaults to `False`.\n- `REFRESH_RATE`: Defaults to `30` the number of seconds to wait until the index page is automatically refreshed.\n- `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`: Defaults to `'production'`, as the name suggests, load all information filtered by this\n    environment value.\n- `REPORTS_COUNT`: Defaults to `10` the limit of the number of reports to load on the node or any reports page.\n- `OFFLINE_MODE`: If set to `True` load static assets (jquery, semantic-ui, etc) from the local web server instead\n    of a CDN. Defaults to `False`.\n- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_ENABLED`: Enable the use of daily chart graphs when looking at dashboard and node view.\n- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_DAYS`: Number of days to show history for on the daily report graphs.\n- `DISPLAYED_METRICS`: Metrics to show when displaying node summary. Example: `'resources.total'`, `'events.noop'`.\n- `TABLE_COUNT_SELECTOR`: Configure the dropdown to limit number of hosts to show per page.\n- `LITTLE_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of reports to show when when looking at a node.\n- `NORMAL_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of nodes to show when displaying reports and catalog nodes.\n- `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP`: If set to `True` then timestamps are shown using your browser's timezone. Otherwise UTC is used. Defaults to `True`.\n- `WITH_EVENT_NUMBERS`: If set to `True` then Overview and Nodes list shows exact number of changed resources\n    in the last report. Otherwise shows only 'some' string if there are resources with given status. Setting this\n    to `False` gives performance benefits, especially in big Puppet environments (more than few hundreds of nodes).\n    Defaults to `True`.\n\n## Getting Help<a id=\"getting-help\"></a>\n\nFor questions or bug reports you can file an [issue](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues).\n\n## Contributing<a id=\"contributing\"></a>\n\n### Development\n\nPuppetboard relies on the [pypuppetdb](https://pypi.org/project/pypuppetdb/) library to fetch data from PuppetDB\nand is built with the help of the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) microframework.\n\nIf you wish to hack on Puppetboard you should fork/clone the Github repository and then install the requirements through:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade wheel setuptools\npython setup.py develop\npip install --upgrade -r requirements-test.txt\nmypy --install-types --non-interactive puppetboard/ test/\n```\n\nYou're advised to do this inside a virtualenv specifically created to work on Puppetboard as to not pollute your global Python installation.\n\nYou can run the tests with:\n```bash\npytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --strict-markers --mypy puppetboard test\npylint --errors-only puppetboard test\n```\n\nYou can run the app it in development mode by simply executing:\n\n```bash\nflask run\n```\n\nYou can specify listening host and port with environment variables or command line otions:\n\n```bash\nexport FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0\nexport FLASK_RUN_PORT=8000\n\nflask run\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nflask run --host '0.0.0.0' --port '8000'\n```\n\n\nUse `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` to change the different settings or patch `default_settings.py` directly.\nTake care not to include your local changes on that file when submitting patches for Puppetboard.\nPlace a `settings.py` file inside the base directory of the git repository that will be used, if the environment\nvariable is not set.\n\nWe welcome contributions to this project.

([#741](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/741)).\n\n4.2.4\n-----\n\n* Fix starting the app when the SECRET_KEY is set to `bytes` instead of `str`. ([#741](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/741)).\n\n4.2.3\n-----\n\n* Sort 'uptime' fact values correctly again - it was fixed in v3.4.0 but got broken in v4.1.0 ([#469](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/469)).\n\n4.2.2\n-----\n* Showing debug messages using a different color than the error messages in the Logs of the Report view. (PR [#725](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/725))   \n* Start warning that the default SECRET_KET will not be provided starting with Puppetboard 5.x - see issue [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721) for more info. (PR [#726](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/726)) \n\nThanks to the contributor of this release, [Shawn Toffel](https://github.com/shawntoffel)!\n\n4.2.1\n-----\n* Fix `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP = False` and document how it works. ([#461](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/461))\n\n4.2.0\n-----\n* Confirm support for Python 3.11 (final), switch the Docker image to use that version of Python.\n\n4.1.2\n-----\n* Fixed incompatibility with Python 3.7 that has occurred at least in the tests (regression introduced in 4.1.1). ([#720](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/720))\n\n4.1.1\n-----\n* Fixed showing facts with graph (regression introduced in 4.1.0). ([#719](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/719))\n\n4.1.0\n-----\n* Show configurable favorite environments immediately after the \"All Environments\" in the dropdown. ([#705](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/705))\n* Automatic OS values for Linux, macOS and Windows nodes in the Inventory view. Customizable Inventory fact values using Jinja templates. PR [#712](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/712), fixes [#485](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/485).\n* Big upgrade of the frontend dependencies, including migration to their maintained forks in a few cases (Semantic UI → Fomantic UI, c3.js → billboard.js). ([#708](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/708))\n\nVery big thanks to [Melchior NOGUES](https://github.com/melck) who did most of the development for this release!\n\n4.0.5\n-----\n(4.0.4 was a partially incorrect release. Please use 4.0.5 instead.)\n\n* Fix Puppetboard not starting on PE PuppetDB. ([#711](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/711))\n\n4.0.3\n-----\n\n* Make facts with integer values which are strings internally findable. ([#706](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/706))\n\nThanks to [Stephen Ryan](https://github.com/ryaner) who contributed to this release!\n\n4.0.2\n-----\n\n* Make the app work when installed from the git repo, f.e. using the [puppet-puppetboard module](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-puppetboard). ([#704](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/704)).\n\n4.0.1\n-----\n\n* Fix the Docker image - make the app start again. ([#701](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/701)).\n* Remove border-radius from the top menu to make it appear more clearly anchored to the page. ([#699](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/699))\n\nThanks to [Marcel Deglau](https://github.com/promarcel) who contributed to this release!\n\n4.0.0\n-----\n\nThis is mostly a maintenance release.\n\nThe major version is bumped because of:\n* dropped support for PuppetDBs < 5.2.0 (Puppet 4 has reached its end-of-life in October 2018),\n* dropped support for Python 3.6 (end-of-life in December 2021).\n\nThere might be some performance improvements thanks to the upgrade of the core dependencies - Flask, Jinja2, Werkzeug etc.\n\nAdditional improvements:\n* Set custom user-agent header that will make troubleshooting easier.\n\n3.6.1\n-----\n\n* Stop modifying the query response for showing as JSON (fixes [#695](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/695), PR [#696](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/696)).\n\n3.6.0\n-----\n\n* Show user-friendly error message when there's a problem with connecting to the PuppetDB and just zeros instead of HTTP 404 when the PuppetDB is just yet empty ([PR #692](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/692), \n* Add a healthcheck to the Docker image ([PR #690](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/690)),\n* Fix Failures view when there are no logs ([PR #693](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/693)).\n\nThanks to the following contributors of this release: [@ArthurWuTW](https://github.com/ArthurWuTW), [@jcpunk](https://github.com/jcpunk), [@carlosduelo](https://github.com/carlosduelo).\n\n3.5.1\n-----\n\n* Fixed friendly error message toggle (when there is no env in the URL) ([#688](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/688)).\n\n3.5.0\n-----\n\n* **Report** view improvements:\n  * show Logs before Events as they are more useful,\n  * show different, arguably more useful columns in Logs by default,\n  * allow showing messages in a \"friendly\" mode (like in Failures view),\n  * make Logs and Events filterable,\n  * don't force column sizes for a better, automatic content layout,\n  * use fixed-width font where it makes more sense,\n* Fix mixed up normal and OFFLINE_MODE for Query view.\n\n3.4.2\n-----\n\n* Fix auto-resize in radiator view,\n* Fix Query tab cannot be disabled on Docker\n* Removed unused import in setup.py,\n\nThanks to the following contributors of this release: [@vilhelmprytz](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz), [@ldumont](https://github.com/ldumont), [@allan-reynolds](https://github.com/allan-reynolds).\n\n3.4.1\n-----\n\n* Fixed broken PyPI package ([#677](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/677)).\n* Made the ToC links work when the README is displayed as the description in PyPI.\n\nThanks to the following contributors of this release: [@Rewerson](https://github.com/Rewerson), [@vchepkov](https://github.com/vchepkov).\n\n3.4.0\n-----\n\n* **Query** view improvements:\n  * Make the result clickable if a certname is in it ([#652](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/652)).\n  * UX improvements: show the number of results, show a user-friendly error in case of a PQL syntax error, show a warning on empty result, use fixed-width font for matching the query with the possible error message, remove useless 'Cancel' button. ([#653](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/653)).\n  * Add 'Download as CSV' and 'Download as XLSX' to the results ([#654](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/654)).\n  * Make the result shareable using URL ([#657](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/657)).\n* New **Failures** view for showing the first error/failed resource for all nodes with a failed puppet run. It can show both \"friendly\" and raw error messages ([#662](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/662)).\n* Sort 'uptime' fact values correctly ([#591](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/591)).\n* Visual tweaks ([#667](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/667)).\n* Improvements for running with Docker:\n  * Configurable binding host in Dockerfile ([#660](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/660)).\n  * Allow passing PuppetDB certificates via environment variables when using Docker, in base64 encoding or not ([#671](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/671)).\n  * Add Puppet code for running Puppetboard using Docker into the README ([#672](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/672)).\n* Add missing fonts and icons to the PyPI package ([#666](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/666)).\n* Refactoring: split views into separate files ([#665](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/665)).\n* Update many dependencies.\n\n✨ Thanks to the following contributors of this release: [@djluo](https://github.com/djluo), [@GermanG](https://github.com/GermanG), [@jgrammen-agilitypr](https://github.com/jgrammen-agilitypr), [@SeanHood](https://github.com/SeanHood), [@tuxmea](https://github.com/tuxmea), [@qhess34](https://github.com/qhess34)! 🌟\n\n3.3.0\n-----\n\n* **Show structured facts as pretty-formatted, syntax-highlighted JSON.** Works on Node view and Facts view. Colors meaning are as follows: orange - number, blue - boolean, green - dict's key name. Implements [#83](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/83).\n* Fix getting nodes with non-string fact values ([#612](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/612)).\n* Fix missing trailing 'u' character in facts with hashes ([#567](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/567)).\n* Add favicon ([#650](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/650))\n\n3.2.0\n-----\n\n* Add from/till filter for reports (issue [#625](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/625), PR [#625](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/638))\n* Remove tabs for disabled features (issue [#627](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/627), PR [#636](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/636))\n* Add support for FreeBSD ([#628](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/628))\n* Add support for Python 3.10 ([#637](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/637))\n\nThanks to [@smortex](https://github.com/smortex) and [@sebastianrakel](https://github.com/sebastianrakel) for their contributions!\n\n3.1.0\n-----\n\n* Improve facts columns balancing (#618)\n* Allow to toggle checkboxes by clicking their label (#617)\n* Add support for Python 3.9 (#619)\n* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=2.4.0.rc1` because\n  we need it for Python 3.9 support\n\n3.0.0\n-----\n\nThis is a bugfix and maintenance release. The major version is bumped \nbecause of the Python 3.5 support drop.\n \nFeatures:\n\n* Change the default sort order of facts table to a-z,\n  instead of z-a (#572)\n* Revamp the README (#601)\n\nBugfixes:\n\n* Fix noop class in _macros.html (#588)\n* Fix listing nodes with boolean fact values (#583)\n* Fix auto-resize in radiator view (#605)\n* Fix issue with no render when facts are empty (#607)\n\nOther:\n\n* Drop Python 3.5 support (#593)\n* Update jQuery to 3.5.1 (#592)\n* Manage any other exception for get_or_abort (#606)\n* Improve getting resources from CDN (#609)  \n* Migrate from Travis to GitHub Actions (#604)\n\n2.2.0\n-----\n\n* Fix default table sort (#444)\n* Use a select for endpoint select in query (#575)\n* Surround multiline messages with <pre> in reports (#576)\n* Fix CI builds by requiring pytest >= 4.6 (#577)\n* Add noop column in overview and nodes (#584)\n* Add title to events labels in overview and nodes (#585)\n\n2.1.2\n----\n\n* Puppet DB 5.2.13 requires v2 metrics\n\n2.1.1\n-----\n\n* Added support for new metrics API `v2` on PuppetDB >= `5.3.11` and < `6.0.0` (#558)\n* Added Python 3.5 back into test matrix (#559)\n* Fixed bug in `dailyreport.js` that caused it not to render when served under a non-default virtual host (#557)\n\n2.1.0\n-----\n\n* Fixed Puppetboard's usage for the new metrics v2 API both on the home page for computing the average resources/node and the `Metrics` listing page. This change now supports the changes in PuppetDB >= 6.9.1 (https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7943/)\n* Added backwards compatability support for both the metric `v1` and `v2` endpoints\n  depending on the version of the server. Any PuppetDB >= `6.9.1` will be queried with\n  the `v2` endpoint automatically (because `v1` is disabled from here forward). Any\n  PuppetDB <= `6.9.0` will use `v1`.\n* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=2.1.0` because changes were needed in this library to support the metrics v2 fixes.\n* app.py: Added python2 backwards compatability fix for importing `urllib`.\n\n2.0.0\n----\n\n* Dockerfile: Switch to python:3.7-alpine image\n* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=1.2.0` to `>=2.0.0`\n* Drop support for python2.7 and python3.5 & Add python3.8 to buildmatrix\n* Upgrade of tests requirements + resolving current deprecation warnings\n* Ignore facts environment for compatibility and performance\n* Adding mypy + Cleanup + CommonMark upgrade to 0.9.1\n* Update docker and fix coveralls not running.\n* Cast inventory data toString\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\n* Move to Python 3.6 for Docker\n* Fix problem loading daily chart on node page\n* fix gunicorn parameter and allow to define workers in docker\n* Add feature for better performance in big Puppet envs\n* bundle requirements.txt for tests and docker\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\n* CI enhancements\n* Allow to configure which PuppetDB endpoints are allowed\n* Update c3 to 4.22\n* Add basic health check endpoint\n* Allow to force the PuppetDB connection protocol\n* Update jquery-tablesort to 0.0.11\n* Fix bug breaking date/time sort\n* Fix formatvalue for list of dicts\n* Modify date sort to handle failed\n* Include template files for altering Semantic css and Google fonts\n* Make 320px the max width for columns\n* If query is None don't perform add on it\n* Query using producer\\_timestamp index vs. start\\_time\n* Add missing components for building source packages\n* Add support for URL prefixes to Docker image\n\n0.3.0\n-----\n\n* Core UI Rework\n* Update to pypuppetdb 0.3.3\n* Fix sorty on data for index\n* Update debian documentation\n* Offline mode fix\n* Fix fact attribute error on paths\n* Enhanced testing\n* Radiator CSS uses same coloring\n* Markdown in config version\n* Update Flask\n* Cleanup requirements.txt\n* Update package maintainer for OpenBSD\n\n0.2.1\n-----\n\n* Daily Charts\n* Fixed missing javascript files on radiator view.\n* TravisCI and Coveralls integration.\n* Fixed app crash in catalog view.\n* Upgrade pypuppetdb to 0.3.2\n* Enhanced queries for Node and Report (\\#271)\n* Optimize Inventory Code.\n* Use certname instead of hostname to identify nodes when applicable.\n* Add environment filter for facts.\n* Update cs.js to 0.4.11\n* Fix radiator column alignment\n* Security checks with bandit\n* Dockerfile now uses gunicorn and environment variables for configuration.\n* Handle division by zero errors.\n* Implement new Jquery Datatables.\n* JSON output for radiator. \\* Move javascript to head tag.\n* Optimize reports and node page queries.\n* Fix all environments for PuppetDB 3.2\n* Fact graph chart now configurable.\n* Support for Flask 0.12 and Jinja2 2.9\n* Fix misreporting noops as changes.\n\n0.2.0\n-----\n\n* Full support for PuppetDB 4.x\n* Updating Semantic UI to 2.1.8\n* Updating Flask-WTF requirements to 0.12\n* Updating WTForms to 2.x\n* Restored CSRF protection on the Query Tab form\n* Updating Pypuppetdb requirement to 0.3.x\n* New configuration option OVERVIEW\\_FILTER allows users to add custom PuppetDB query clauses to include/exclude nodes displayed on the index page\n* Adding Radiator view similar to what is available in Puppet Dashboard\n* Adding a drop-down list in the Reports tab to configure the number of reports displayed\n* Removing unneeded report\\_latest() endpoint. This endpoint was deprecated with the addition of the latest\\_report\\_hash field in the Nodes PuppetDB endpoint\n* Enhancing Report pagination\n* Using the OOP Query Builder available in Pypuppetdb 0.3.x\n* Allowing PQL queries in the Query Tab\n* Fixing double url-quoting bug on Metric endpodint calls\n* Adding a Boolean field to the Query form to prettyprint responses from PuppetDB\n* Fixing corner-case where empty environments would trigger a ZeroDivisionError due to the Number of Nodes divided by the Number of Resources calculation\n* Adding additional logging in utils.py\n\n0.1.2\n-----\n* Add configuration option to set the default environment with new configuration option DEFAULT\\_ENVIRONMENT, defaults to 'production'.\n* Loading all available environments with every page load.\n* Adding an \"All Environments\" item to the Environments dropdown to remove all environment filters on PuppetDB data.\n* Updating README.rst to update links and describe new configuration options.\n* Fixing Query form submission problem by disabling CSRF protection.

This is configurable with the configuration option REFRESH\\_RATE \\* Fixing the table alignment in the catalog\\_compare() page by switching to fixed tables from basic tables. \\* Using colors similar to Puppet Dashboard and Foreman for the status counts sections\n\n0.1.1\n-----\n\n* Fix bug where the reports template was not generating the report links with the right environment\n\n0.1.0\n-----\n\n* Requires pypuppetdb \\>= 0.2.0\n* Drop support for PuppetDB 2 and earlier\n* Full support for PuppetDB 3.x\n* The first directory location is now a Puppet environment which is filtered on all supported queries. Users can browse different environments with a select field in the top NavBar\n* Using limit, order\\_by and offset parameters adding pagaination on the Reports page (available in the NavBar). Functionality is available to pages that accept a page attribute.\n* The report page now directly queries pypuppetdb to match the report\\_id value with the report hash or configuration\\_version fields.\n* Catching and aborting with a 404 if the report and report\\_latest function queries do not return a generator object.\n* Adding a Catalogs page (similar to the Nodes page) with a form to compare one node's catalog information with that of another node.\n* Updating the Query Endpoints for the Query page.\n* Adding to `templates/_macros.html` status\\_counts that shows node/report status information, like what is avaiable on the index and nodes pages, available to the reports pages and tables also.\n* Showing report logs and metrics in the report page.\n* Removing `limit_reports` from `utils.py` because this helper function has been replaced by the limit PuppetDB paging function.\n\n**Known Issues**\n\n* fact\\_value pages rendered from JSON valued facts return no results. A more sophisticated API is required to make use of JSON valued facts (through the factsets, fact-paths and/or fact-contents endpoints for example)\n\n0.0.5\n-----\n\n* Now requires WTForms versions less than 2.0\n* Adding a Flask development server in `dev.py`.\n* Adding CSRF protection VIA the flask\\_wtf CsrfProtect object.\n* Allowing users to configure the report limit on pages where reports are listed with the LIMIT\\_REPORTS configuration option.\n* Adding an inventory page to users to be able to see all available nodes and a configure lists of facts to display VIA the INVENTORY\\_FACTS configuration option.\n* Adding a page to view a node's catalog information if enabled, disabled by default. Can be changed with the ENABLE\\_CATALOG configuration attribute.\n* New configuration option GRAPH\\_FACTS allows the user to choose which graphs will generate pie on the fact pages.\n* Replacing Chart.js with c3.js and d3.js.\n* Adding Semantic UI 0.16.1 and removing unused bootstrap styles.\n* Adding an OFFLINE\\_MODE configuration option to load local assets or from a CDN service. This is useful in environments without internet access.\n\n0.0.4\n-----\n\n* Fix the sorting of the different tables containing facts.\n* Fix the license in our `setup.py`. The license shouldn't be longer than 200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up tools like bdist\\_rpm.\n\n0.0.3\n-----\n\nThis release introduces a few big changes. The most obvious one is the revamped\nOverview page which has received significant love. Most of the work was done by\nJulius Härtl. The Nodes tab has been given a slight face-lift too.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* This release depends on the new pypuppetdb 0.1.0. Because of this the SSL configuration options have been changed:\n  * `PUPPETDB_SSL` is gone and replaced by `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY` which now defaults to `True`. This only affects connections to PuppetDB that happen over SSL.\n  * SSL is automatically enabled if both `PUPPETDB_CERT` and `PUPPETDB_KEY` are provided.\n* Display of deeply nested metrics and query results have been fixed.\n* Average resources per node metric is now displayed as a natural number.\n* A link back to the node has been added to the reports.\n* A few issues with reports have been fixed.\n* A new setting called `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS` has been added which denotes the amount of hours after which Puppetboard will display the node as unreported if it hasn't checked in. We default to `2` hours.\n* The event message can now be viewed by clicking on the event.\n\nPuppetboard is now neatly packaged up and available on PyPI. This should\nsignificantly help reduce the convoluted installation instructions people had\nto follow.\n\nUpdated installation instructions have been added on how to install from PyPI\nand how to configure your HTTPD.\n\n0.0.2\n-----\n\nIn this release we've introduced a few new things. First of all we now require pypuppetdb version 0.0.4 or later which includes support for the v3 API introduced with PuppetDB 1.5.\n\nBecause of changes in PuppetDB 1.5 and therefor in pypuppetdb users of the v2 API, regardless of the PuppetDB version, will no longer be able to view reports or events.\n\nIn light of this the following settings have been removed:\n\n* `PUPPETDB_EXPERIMENTAL`\n\nTwo new settings have been added:\n\n* `PUPPETDB_API`: an integer, defaulting to `3`, representing the API version we want to use.\n* `ENABLE_QUERY`: a boolean, defaulting to `True`, on wether or not to be able to use the Query tab.\n\nWe've also added a few new features:\n\n* Thanks to some work done during PuppetConf together with Nick Lewis (from Puppet Labs) we now expose all of PuppetDB's metrics in the Metrics tab. The formatting isn't exactly pretty but it's a start.\n* Spencer Krum added the graphing capabilities to the Facts tab.\n* Daniel Lawrence added a feature so that facts on the node view are clickable and take you to the complete overview of that fact for your infrastructure and made the nodes in the complete facts list clickable so you can jump to a node.\n* Klavs Klavsen contributed some documentation on how to run Puppetboard with Passenger.\n\n0.0.1\n-----\n\nInitial release.\n\n",
