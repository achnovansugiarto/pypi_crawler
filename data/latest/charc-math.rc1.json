    "description": "# charc_math\n\nThis started out as a private collection of maths functions, many will be quite simple. Over time I've got quite a few, and I thought it should be shared. Nothing is too complicated - I hope.\n\n__tl;dr__ Maths functions.\n\n## Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport charc_math as c\n\nprint c.primes(10):\n#Output [2, 3, 5, 7] \n```\n\nEach function comes with a suffiecient docstring, including what arguments it takes and what it returns.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEach function here has at some point been written and used by me to solve various maths problems, from ProjectEuler, to PythonChallenge, to my own recreational maths work.\n\n## Installation\n\n```Bash\nsudo pip install charc_math\n```\n\n```Python\nimport charc_math\n# as you normally would...\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nEach one has gone through a decent amount of testing before finally being put into this proper collection. If you find any bugs contact me at the email provided and I'll look into it.\n\n```Python\ndef test_primes():\n\tassert_equal(primes(100),[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97])\n\tassert_equal(primes(2),[2])\n\tassert_equal(primes(-10),[])\n\tassert_equal(primes(1),[])\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\nSo far just me. I'd like to thank any of my friends who will have without a doubt readover at least one of these files just to make sure it has no typos or anything else stupid.\n\n## License\n\nMIT.\n__Basically__ I don't care what you do with the code so long as you:\n\n- [ ] don't ~~try to pass it off as your own~~ _(lol, I know just how basic it is.)_\n- [x] give me credit\n\n##TODO\n\n- [ ] Finish porting all of this from everywhere into one place\n- [ ] Work on more common maths functions\n- [ ] Speed - _not the drug or the film_\n- [x] Sort out the README page\n- [ ] ???\n\nContact me if you want to add more things to that list.\n\n#### Known Bugs\nEach bug I find is with the function, but still a general list for those unwilling to read (including me)\n- isAP is ~~not very numerically accurate~~ better now.\n- isGP is not at all numerically accurate, this needs lots of work and fixing",
