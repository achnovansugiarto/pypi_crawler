The top of the invoice usually includes the:\n- contact information of the seller\n- contact information of the buyer\n- date of the invoice\n\nIn the middle of the invoice is a list of products or services. A line item refers to a line from this list. The line item describes the product or service, quantity, rate, price, and taxes.\n\nAt the bottom of the invoice is a summary which usually includes:\n- subtotal (before tax)\n- total (with tax) amount\n- payment terms.\n\nThis package aims to provide the tools to create and edit invoices. This is useful for sending by the seller or receiving by the buyer.\n\n# Requirements\n- Requires Python 3.x. Due to security fixes and new features Python 3.7 or later is recommended.\n- pip\n\n\nThird-party dependencies may have additional requirements.\n\n# Installation\nYou can retrieve the invoices package from the Python Package Index https://pypi.org/ using pip. First make sure you have python3 and python3-pip installed. Then you can start by making a `requirements.txt` file in your working directory with the invoices requirement in it. You can add any other packages to your requirements here, each as a separate line.\n\nrequirements.txt:\n```\nmindpowered-invoices>0\n```\nNow you can use pip to install the invoices package: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\nIf you would like to update the package, simply run the above command again.\n\n\n# Usage\n```python\nfrom mindpowered_invoices import *\n\ninv = Invoices()\ninv.Create(\"354\", \"2153\", \"2021-02-01\", \"2021-03-01\", \"Thanks for the business!\")\n\n```\n\n\n# Support\nWe are here to support using this package. If it doesn't do what you're looking for, isn't working, or you just need help, please [Contact us][contact].\n\nThere is also a public [Issue Tracker][bugs] available for this package.\n\n# Licensing\nThis package is released under the MIT License.\n\n\n\n[bugs]: https://github.com/mindpowered/invoices-python/issues\n[contact]: https://mindpowered.dev/support/?ref=invoices-python/\n[docs]: https://mindpowered.github.io/invoices-python/\n[licensing]: https://mindpowered.dev/?ref=invoices-python\n[purchase]: https://mindpowered.dev/purchase/\n\n\n",
