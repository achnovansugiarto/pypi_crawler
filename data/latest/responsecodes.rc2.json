They provide information about the status of the requested resource or operation, and are typically used by web browsers and other clients to determine how to handle the response.\n\n### Description\nHTTP status codes are typically used by clients to determine how to handle the server's response. For example, a web browser might display a 404 Not Found error page if it receives that status code in response to a request for a web page. In addition, HTTP status codes can be used by servers to provide information about the status of an operation. For example, a server might return a 200 OK status code in response to a successful login request, or a 403 Forbidden status code in response to an unauthorized request to access a protected resource.\n\nHTTP status codes are grouped into five categories to provide feedback regarding the requests made by the client.\n\n**Informational responses (100-199):** These are interim responses that indicate that the client's request is being processed. They are not typically seen by users, as they are usually handled automatically by the client.\n\n**Successful responses (200-299):** These indicate that the client's request was successfully processed by the server. The most commonly used status code in this category is 200 OK, which indicates that the request was successful.\n\n**Redirection messages (300-399):** These indicate that the client must take additional action to complete the request. For example, a 301 Moved Permanently response indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.\n\n**Client error responses (400-499):** These indicate that there was an error in the client's request. Common status codes in this category include 404 Not Found, which indicates that the requested resource could not be found, and 403 Forbidden, which indicates that the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.\n\n**Server error responses (500-599):** These indicate that there was an error on the server side. Common status codes in this category include 500 Internal Server Error, which indicates a generic server error, and 503 Service Unavailable, which indicates that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request.\n\n<a name=\"getting_started\"></a>\n### Getting Started\n\n<a name=\"dependencies\"></a>\n#### Dependencies\n* Python 3.8\n* Standard set by the source https://httpwg.org.\n\n<a name=\"file_structure\"></a>\n#### File Structure\n```\nresponsecodes\n|\n├── LICENSE\n├── README.md\n├── responsecodes\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── __version__.py\n│   └── responsecodes.py\n├── setup.py\n└── test\n    └── test_responsecodes.py\n```\n\n<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n### Installing\n\n**httpcodes installation**\n\n```console\npip install responsecodes \n```\n- OR\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip install responsecodes\n```\n\n- OR\n\n**Clone the repository **\n\n```console\n    > git clone git@github.com:iamkamleshrangi/responsecodes.git\n    > cd responsecodes \n    > ..\n```\n \n<a name=\"instructions\"></a>\n#### Instructions\n```python\n\n>>> import responsecodes\n>>> \n>>> response_code = 200\n>>> responsecodes.get_response_by_code(response_code)\n{'code': 200,\n 'category': 'Successful responses',\n 'short_description': '200 OK',\n 'description': 'The request succeeded.
