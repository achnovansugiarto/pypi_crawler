    "description": "# nightflight\n\nThis is a very small library that leverages the astral package to calculate how\nmuch of a flight occurs during regulatory night time (30 minutes before sunset to\n30 minutes after sunrise).\n\nThis calculation is somewhat complicated because sunset and sunrise are a\nfunction of location, and location is changing rapidly during a flight.\n\nPositions and times during the flight are approximated by assuming that the\nflight follows a great circle track between origin and destination and that\nvelocity is constant throughout.\n\nThe latter assumption is likely the greatest source of error, since average\nvelocity along the great circle track will be much lower during the initial and\nterminal manoeuvring phases.\n\nThe assumption of great circle track may also be erroneous on very long\ntrips. If a trip starts on exactly opposite sides of the planet, there are an\ninfinite number of equally efficient tracks to choose from, so when the\nsituation is close to this, the actual track flown may end up being radically\ndifferent from that assumed.\n\nThe main function takes n_vectors (vectors normal to the tangent plane at a\ngiven location) as arguments to avoid dealing with singularities. A database of\nn_vectors for airfields as designated by their three letter IATA code is\nincluded. This data is a processed version of the database generously provided\nby openflights.org (see <https://openflights.org/data.html>). The `make_locations`\nmodule has a `to_nvec` function to convert an arbitrary latitude and longitude\nto an n_vector .\n\n\n",
