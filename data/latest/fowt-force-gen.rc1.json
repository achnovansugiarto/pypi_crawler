    "description": "# FOWT Force Gen\nThe entirety of this package is designed to generate force demands and platform motions for a\nfloating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) modeled in a particular location, then export these data to MAT files. These MAT\n files are formatted in a particular way to be readable by MATLAB code used in my other GitHub repository, [Rel-Opt](https://github.com/michaelcdevin/Rel-Opt).\nThis package relies on NOAA's National Buoy Data Center for wind and wave resources, and uses NREL's OpenFAST software\nto generate the FOWT response.\n\nAspects of this package provide broader use that isn't reliant on Rel-Opt. Different parts of this package are\ncapable of:\n- Gathering wind and wave data at specific geographic coordinates\n- Quickly generated OpenFAST files, either in isolation or in bulk\n- Generating a MoorDyn file with proper platform rigid body modes and frequencies for a water depth\n- Parsing OUTB files from previous OpenFAST simulations\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Requirements\n[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher, with the standard library and the following modules:\n- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)\n- [requests](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)\n- [windrose](https://pypi.org/project/windrose/)\n- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)\n\nTo use the full functionality of the software, the following are also required (examples are included that do not require\nthese programs):\n- [OpenFAST v2.3.0 or higher](https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/master/)\n- [TurbSim](https://raf-openfast.readthedocs.io/en/docs-turbsim/source/user/turbsim/running_ts.html)\n    - This is included in the OpenFAST repository, but must be compiled independently\n\nAn internet connection is also required to access the [National Buoy Data Center website](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/). \n\n#### Install via pip\nThis package can be downloaded from PyPI and installed using:\n\n`$ pip install fowt_force_gen`\n\n#### Setup\nAfter installation, the full file paths to the OpenFAST and TurbSim executables must be specified in the\n`fast_file_path.txt` and `turbsim_file_path.txt` files, respectively, located in the fowt_force_gen root directory\n(this path can be found from command line using `pip show fowt_force_gen`).\n\n## Running the Program\n**Note: if testing this package without OpenFAST/TurbSim installed, skip down to\n[Examples without OpenFAST or TurbSim](#examples-without-openfast-or-turbsim).**\n\nTo run the entire program sequence (including OpenFAST and TurbSim), the following information needs to be provided:\n- Latitude/longitude in decimal degrees\n- Platform type (currently only works with the OC4-DeepCwind platform, though functionality with the OC3-Hywind platform\nis in development)\n- Root of the filename desired for the output MAT and CSV files.\n\n**Due to dependencies on included data files, this package must be run from the root directory as specified by\n`pip show fowt_force_gen`.** Directory-agnostic operation will be included in a forthcoming release.\n\nFor example, for a OC4-DeepCwind site located at 40&deg; 6' N, 125&deg;, at the command line at the package root\n directory, type\n\n`$ python -m fowt_force_gen.fowt_force_gen --latitude 40.1N --longitude 125W --platform OC4 --fileroot Site1`\n\nThe package will generate:\n- `Site1_bin_probabilities.csv` in the current directory, indicating the probability of wind\ncoming at each speed and direction\n- Two sets of MAT files of format\n`Reliability_Results_Site1_##mps_##deg_Climate#.mat` and `Surge_Site1_##mps_##deg_Climate#.mat`, located in a\n`force_gen` folder within the current directory.\n    - The sections of the filenames indicated by `##` symbols preceding `mps` and `deg` indicate the wind speed (in m/s)\n    and direction (clockwise starting from north), respectively, and the `#` symbol proceeding `Climate` indicates the\n    wave climate specified. Wave climates can be specified based on user input after the monthly wave data is displayed:\n\n    ![Wave climate user prompt](../src/pre-fast_cmd_1.png)\n    ![Wave climate user entry](../src/pre-fast_cmd_2.png)\n\n\n### Examples without OpenFAST or TurbSim\nDue to the length of time it takes OpenFAST to run, it is recommended to run these examples that do not require\nOpenFAST or TurbSim. **Again, these examples must be run from the package root directory as specified by\n`pip show fowt_force_gen`.**\n\n#### Example 1: `pre_fast`\nThis command generates all needed OpenFAST and TurbSim input files for the given geographic coordinates. The\nmooring system tuning step (which requires OpenFAST as well) is skipped; a pre-tuned MoorDyn file is used instead.\nThis is effectively the entire procedure to setup for the main OpenFAST operation (as the name suggests).\n\nTo analyze an offshore site with the OC4-DeepCwind platform off the northern California coast (using NOAA Station 46014\nas the reference), type\n\n`$ python -m fowt_force_gen.pre_fast -lat 39N -lon 124W -pf OC4 -fr _ -ex 1`\n\nAfter a few moments, monthly wave data will be displayed on the console, with user input prompts to split the analysis\ninto multiple wave climates based on the data. If \"no\" is selected at the prompt, a different wave climate will be made\nfor each month (this will result in a LOT of created files and is not recommended unless intentional&mdash;answer \"yes\"\nand make 1 or 2 custom wave climates for now).\n\nThe generated OpenFAST and TurbSim files will be created in the `force_gen` and `turbsim_files` directories,\nrespectively. An `example1_bin_probabilities.csv` will be created in the root directory as well.\n\n**General use:** `fowt_force_gen.pre_fast` can be run with the tuning step included by removing the\n`-ex 1` argument and specifying a file root for the `-fr` argument. Note that this step requires OpenFAST and TurbSim.\n\n#### Example 2: `post_fast`\nThis command generates the MAT files from a set of OpenFAST output files, generated after the main OpenFAST operation\n would ordinarily finish. A small set of the output files generated from running Example 1 in OpenFAST is included in\n this package as an example. At the command line, type\n\n`$ python -m fowt_force_gen.post_fast -dir example_files/post-fast`\n\nThe generated MAT files will be created in the `force_gen` directory.\n\n**General use:** Any directory can be specified for the `-dir` parameter as long as the directory contains at least one\n`.outb` file and three `.MD.Line#.out` files, all with the same filename.\n\n#### Example 3: `buoy`\nThis command finds the nearest NOAA buoy to the entered coordinates, and optionally saves recently archived wind, wave,\nand current data to text files in the root directory.\n\nFor example, if broadly searching for data in the Gulf of Mexico (centered at about 25&deg;N, 90&deg;W), type\n\n`python -m fowt_force_gen.buoy -lat 25 -lon -90 -r 5000 -w`\n\nThis will identify the nearest buoy via the command prompt (NOAA Station 42001 at time of writing, though this may\nchanged due to buoy drift or new installations). Including the `-w` parameter writes up to three text files, one each\nfor archived metocean, wind, and current data, though fewer may be written if data is unavailable (for Station 42001,\nall three are generated).\n\n**General use:** The `-r` can be changed to any value between 1 and 9999 for smaller or larger scale searches (it can\nalso be excluded, with 1000km as the default). Removing the `-w` parameter will still give the nearest buoy number in\nthe command prompt.\n\n#### Example 4: `filegen`\nThis command generates a new OpenFAST or TurbSim input file from an existing file, while changing the specified\nOpenFAST/TurbSim parameters within the file. This is useful for scripting, when batches of input files must be made over\na range of modeling conditions.\n\nFor an existing OpenFAST input file located at `%root%/example_files/example4.dat`, type\n\n`python -m fowt_force_gen.filegen --input example_files/example4.dat --output example4_new.dat --param GenDOF False\n--numparam BlPitch 1 90 2 45 3 30`\n\nTo generate a new file named `example4_new.dat` with GenDOF changed to False, BlPitch(1) changed to 90, BlPitch(2)\nchanged to 45, and BlPitch(3) changed to 30 (note: changing the blade pitch like this for an actual simulation is a\nbad idea).\n\n**General use:** `filegen` can be used for any `.fst`, `.dat`, or `.inp` file in the typical OpenFAST format. Since the\nMoorDyn module uses a different file format, add a `-md` argument to the command call if modifying a MoorDyn `.dat` file.\n\n## License\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020 Software Development for Engineering Research\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
