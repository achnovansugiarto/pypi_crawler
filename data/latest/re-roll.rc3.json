    "description": "# re-roll\n\nTreat a directory as a collection of \"random-encounter\" tables for use as a DM, GM, or Whatever-M for any tabletop game.\nSupports directories of arbitrary depth, as well as a very minimalist formatting code.\n\n[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-v0.1.0-blue.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/re-roll/)\n\n## Install\n\nFirst, ensure your python version is greater than or equal to version 3.9.9, then run:\n\n```\npython -m pip install re-roll\n```\n\n## Windows Install\n\nSame as above. However, if you get this output when trying to run **re-roll**:\n```\n're-roll' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\n\nthen you need to add your Python Scripts directory to your system environment PATH variable.\n\nYou can find tutorials on how to do this online. Say you're running Python3.10 on your machine. Your Scripts directory\nis probably located in:\n```\nC:\\Users\\<your-user>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Scripts\n```\n\nYou can check your Python version with the command:\n```\npython -v\n```\n\nSometimes, your system is directed to the wrong version of Python when trying to use Python from the command line.\nWhile you are editing your System Environment Variables, ensure that the path pointing to your Python install\nis pointing to the most recent version that is installed on your machine.\n\n## Usage\n\nNavigate to a directory containing an arbitrary number of subfolders, each containing any number of .txt files with\nthe description of a random encounter within.\n\nThen  use the:\n```\nre-roll roll\n```\ncommand to choose a random text file from within the directory.\n\nFor example, given the following directory structure:\n\n* 5e\n\t* wilderness\n\t\t* wolves.txt\n\t\t* bandits.txt\n\t\t* druids.txt\n\t* urban\n\t\t* robbers.txt\n\t\t* sewer-ghouls.txt\n\t\t* thieves.txt\n\nrunning **re-roll** from within **5e** will choose a text file from either wilderness or urban, while running\n**re-roll roll** within either subdirectories will only choose files within their selected folders.\n\nExample output from running the program from within the above subdirectory:\n```\nwilderness(1d2=1)>bandits.txt (1d3=2)\n\nThe players encounter a group of 1d4+2 bandits blocking the path.\nThey demand the players surrender all of their valuables...\n```\n\nRunning the program with no arguments selects the current working directory (that is, the directory you are running the program) from as the\ntop-level directory to traverse.\n\nYou can provide another directory with the **-d** or **--dir** command line argument. For example:\n```\nre-roll roll --dir ./wilderness\n```\n\nwould only roll from the wilderness directory, provided of course that you are in the 5e directory (since the '.' denotes 'current working directory')\n\n## Formatting Output\n\nThis program features a very simple parser that can format the output of your random encounters. This can\nbe useful to highlight important text like dice rolls or monster names. This feature is only supported by\nconsoles that suport ANSI formatting escape sequences.\n\nText encased in a set of {curly brackets} becomes *italicized*, while text encased in \\[square brackets\\] is **emboldened**.\n\nYou can disable this feature by running the program with the **--no_escape** option.\n\n## List Mode\n\nRun the re-roll **list** module to list all possible tables to roll from (i.e. all subfolders in the given, or\ncurrent working directory).\n\nFor example, running:\n```\nre-roll list\n```\n\nin the above example would output:\n```\nwilderness urban\n```\n\nProviding a directory with the **-d** or **--dir** option also modified which dir is listed.\n\nFor your convenience, some outputting options have been bundled with the list module. Use the help module as specified below to learn more.\n\n## Specify a Table by Name\n\nUsing the names outputted by the **-l** or **--list** options, you can use the **-t** or **--table** option to to roll from a specific\ntable.\n\nThis is quicker than using the **--dir** option.\n\nFor example, compare:\n```\nre-roll -t ghosts\n```\n\nto:\n```\nre-roll {roll/list} --dir ./monsters/by-source/tob-ii/by-cr/cr4/undead/ghosts\n```\n\n## Quiet Mode\nNormally, the output includes all the subfolders that were selected, as well as the number that was rolled to select them.\n\nSometiems you just don't want to include that superfluous detail. Use the **--quiet** option to only output the selected encounter.\n\n## The Help Module\n\nEach module has a seperate help menu. You can access help menus as usual (by using **re-roll {module} -h**, or you can use the help module.\nFor example, to get help on the list module, you would type:\n\n```\nre-roll help list\n```\n\n\n",
