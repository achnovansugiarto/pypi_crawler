    "description": "# cTimer - High Precision Timer Extension\n\n`cTimer` provides a nanosecond-precision timer to Python.\n\n##Usage\n\n\timport cTimer as timer\n\t\n\tstart = timer.start()\n\t\n\t# Do a bunch of things here that take some time.\n\t\n\tcheckpoint = timer.checkpoint()\n\t\n\t# Do some more time-vampire things here.\n\t\n\tstop = timer.stop()\n\t\n\tprint timer.diff(start, stop) # Total execution time\n\tprint timer.diff(start, checkpoint) # Execution time of first half\n\tprint timer.diff(checkpoint, stop) # Execution time of second half\n\t\n\tprint timer.get() # Time since cTimer was imported\n\n## Methods\n\n**`start()`** - returns an `int` referencing the current time stamp.\n\n**`checkpoint()`** - returns an `int` referencing the current time stamp.\n\n**`stop()`** - returns an `int` referencing the current time stamp.\n\n**`diff(int A, int B)`** - returns the difference between two timestamp references provided by `start()`, `checkpoint()` or `stop()`. Order does not matter, result is always a positive `float` representing seconds.\n\n**`get()`** - returns the number of seconds as a `float` since the `cTimer` library was `import`ed.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository into a new folder. Run the following commands (you *may* need to `sudo` the second one):\n\n\tpython setup.py build\n\tpython setup.py install\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is a lightweight extension and has not been thouroughly tested on all combinations of platforms and Python versions.\n\nIt has been tested on CentOS 5, Ubuntu 10.4, and OSX 10.5 to 10.8 using Python 2.7 and Python 3.2. All platforms were 64-bit.\n\nThis *should* work with 32-bit hosts, but that has not been tested yet.\n\nThis *does not* work on Windows hosts yet.",
