    "description": "# py-starbound-dungeons\n\nThis package provides a utility to parse\n[Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/) dungeon files and index the\nmaterials and objects used within them. It is able to accurately parse\nboth PNG and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) dungeons.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install is to use pip:\n\n```\npip install py-starbound-dungeons\n```\n\nThe source can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/rl-starbound/py-starbound-dungeons\n\n## Index Generation\n\nThe utility provided by this package operates under the assumption that\nthe user has extracted the game's assets from its `.pak` files. Doing so\nis left as an exercise for the user.\n\nTo generate indices, run the command, giving it source and destination\nfolders:\n\n```\npystarbound-dungeons-indexer -s assets -d indices\n```\n\nwhere `assets` is the path to the unpacked assets folder and `indices`\nis the path to the folder to which the indices will be written. The\nprogram will create `indices` if it does not exist, and will overwrite\nany indices that already exist under `indices`.\n\nOn the author's laptop, the process of indexing all of the Starbound\nbase assets takes about 35 minutes. It needs to be re-run only if the\nindexed assets change, e.g., after a new release of Starbound.\n\n### Indexing Mod Assets\n\nIn Starbound, mods are applied as an overlay virtual file system, with\nthe base assets (usually) forming the lowest layer, and mod assets\nlayered on top, either overwriting or patching lower-ranked assets. The\nindexer provided in this package can be used to index mod dungeon parts\nas well as those of the base game, however, users should be aware that\nit does not attempt to replicate the complexity of the Starbound mod\noverlay system, resulting in important limitations:\n* It indexes only one mod at a time.\n* It does not attempt to apply patches. It indexes only PNG and Tiled\n  JSON dungeon parts.\n* For Tiled dungeon parts, it requires all referenced tilesets to exist\n  in the correct locations relative to the dungeon parts. In practice,\n  this usually means that the base game's tilesets must be symbolically\n  linked into the mod's `tilesets` folder prior to running the indexer.\n  How to do this varies based on the user's operating system, and is\n  left as an exercise for the user.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use a separate destination folder for each\nmod, as well as for the base game assets. The following is a recommended\ndestination folder structure for indexes for the base game and mods:\n\n```\n${HOME}/\n  starbound-indices/\n    base-game/\n    mod1/\n    mod2/\n    ...\n```\n\n## Index Format\n\nIndices are written in comma-separated values files with the following\ncolumns:\n* `layer`\n* for PNG files: RGBA `color`; for Tiled files: `gid` or blank\n* `x-axis coordinate` (non-material/mod tiles only)\n* `y-axis coordinate` (non-material/mod tiles only)\n* `tileset name` (Tiled materials and objects only)\n* `tileset first gid` (Tiled materials and objects only)\n* `tileset offset` (Tiled materials and objects only)\n* `entity type`\n* `entity name`\n* optional modifier(s)\n\nThe primary purpose of this program is to index \"interesting\" entities\nthat appear in dungeon parts, such as materials, liquids, objects,\nmaterial mods, monsters, NPCs, vehicles, and some stagehands. The author\nhas chosen not to index \"uninteresting\" entities such as wiring,\nanchors, connectors, and most stagehands. In general, \"interesting\"\nentities as those for which a user would likely wish to search by name.\n\n### Index Format Notes\n\nIn PNG dungeon parts, multiple entities may be recorded as having the\nsame `color`. This is because some PNG colors are declared in the\n`.dungeon` files to represent a combination of background layer and\nforeground layer or object, or a combination of liquid and object.\n\nIn PNG dungeon parts, materials and liquids are recorded only once per\n`color`, regardless of how many times that color appears in the part.\nLikewise, in Tiled dungeon parts, materials, liquids, and mods are\nrecorded only once per `layer` in which they appear. In both cases, this\nis done to avoid exploding the indices with millions of rows of the same\nentities.\n\nPNG dungeons do not contain layers in the same sense that Tiled dungeons\ndo. For the `layer` field in PNG dungeon parts, layer names have been\nassigned contextually, based on the layer in which a similar entity in a\nTiled dungeon would be placed.\n\nIn Tiled dungeon parts, if `gid` is blank, the three tileset fields will\nalso be blank, and vice versa. In most cases in Tiled dungeon parts,\nwhen `gid` is not blank, it will be equal to `tileset first gid +\ntileset offset`. Cases in which this equality does not hold indicate\nthat the object's image is flipped horizontally in the Tiled dungeon\npart.\n\n## Index Search\n\nIndices will be written using the same folder structure as the dungeon\nfiles, with one index per dungeon part file. Users can simply open and\nread the indices. However, use a of text search tool, such as the Unix\n`grep` tool, will allow fast searching for specific entities.\n\nNote that, in all given examples, it is assumed that the user uses the\n`cd` command to enter the top-level folder of the index before entering\nsearch commands.\n\nA simple search for any match of microwave in any part of any index:\n\n```\ngrep -Hr microwave .\n```\n\nA search for any object beginning with the word microwave:\n\n```\ngrep -Hr ,object,microwave .\n```\n\nAdvanced text search features can be used to narrowly target searches.\nFor example, grep has extensive support for regular expression pattern\nmatching. For example, to find any type of material that contains the\nword fence.\n\n```\ngrep -Hr ',material,[^,]*fence[^,]*$' .\n```\n",
