    "description": ".. _readthedocs.org: http://www.readthedocs.org\n.. _bower: http://www.bower.io\n.. _sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org\n.. _compass: http://www.compass-style.org\n.. _sass: http://www.sass-lang.com\n.. _wyrm: http://www.github.com/snide/wyrm/\n.. _grunt: http://www.gruntjs.com\n.. _node: http://www.nodejs.com\n.. _demo: http://docs.readthedocs.org\n.. _hidden: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/toctree.html\n\n**************************\nRead the Docs Sphinx Theme\n**************************\n\n.. contents:: \n\nView a working demo_ over on readthedocs.org_.\n\nThis is a mobile-friendly sphinx_ theme I made for readthedocs.org_. It's\ncurrently in development there and includes some rtd variable checks that can be ignored\nif you're just trying to use it on your project outside of that site.\n\n**This repo also exists as a submodule within the readthedocs itself**, so please make your edits to\nthe SASS files here, rather than the .css files on RTD.\n\n.. image:: screen_mobile.png\n    :width: 100%\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nVia package\n-----------\n\nDownload the package or add it to your ``requirements.txt`` file:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install sphinx_ops_theme\n\nIn your ``conf.py`` file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import sphinx_ops_theme\n\n    html_theme = \"sphinx_ops_theme\"\n\n    html_theme_path = [sphinx_ops_theme.get_html_theme_path()]\n\nVia git or download\n-------------------\n\nSymlink or subtree the ``sphinx_ops_theme/sphinx_ops_theme`` repository into your documentation at\n``docs/_themes/sphinx_ops_theme`` then add the following two settings to your Sphinx\nconf.py file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    html_theme = \"sphinx_ops_theme\"\n    html_theme_path = [\"_themes\", ]\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nv0.1.9\n------\n\n* Intermittent scrollbar visibility bug fixed. This change introduces a\n  backwards incompatible change to the theme's layout HTML. This should only be\n  a problem for derivative themes that have overridden styling of nav elements\n  using direct decendant selectors. See `#215`_ for more information.\n* Safari overscroll bug fixed\n* Version added to the nav header\n* Revision id was added to the documentation footer if you are using RTD\n* An extra block, ``extrafooter`` was added to allow extra content in the\n  document footer block\n* Fixed modernizr URL\n* Small display style changes on code blocks, figure captions, and nav elements\n\n.. _#215: https://github.com/snide/sphinx_ops_theme/pull/215\n\nv0.1.8\n------\n\n* Start keeping changelog :)\n* Support for third and fourth level headers in the sidebar\n* Add support for Sphinx 1.3\n* Add sidebar headers for :caption: in Sphinx toctree\n* Clean up sidebar scrolling behavior so it never scrolls out of view\n\nHow the Table of Contents builds\n================================\n\nCurrently the left menu will build based upon any ``toctree(s)`` defined in your index.rst file.\nIt outputs 2 levels of depth, which should give your visitors a high level of access to your\ndocs. If no toctrees are set the theme reverts to sphinx's usual local toctree.\n\nIt's important to note that if you don't follow the same styling for your rST headers across\nyour documents, the toctree will misbuild, and the resulting menu might not show the correct\ndepth when it renders.\n\nAlso note that the table of contents is set with ``includehidden=true``. This allows you\nto set a hidden toc in your index file with the hidden_ property that will allow you\nto build a toc without it rendering in your index.\n\nBy default, the navigation will \"stick\" to the screen as you scroll. However if your toc\nis vertically too large, it will revert to static positioning. To disable the sticky nav\naltogether change the setting in ``conf.py``.\n\nContributing or modifying the theme\n===================================\n\nThe sphinx_ops_theme is primarily a sass_ project that requires a few other sass libraries. I'm\nusing bower_ to manage these dependencies and sass_ to build the css. The good news is\nI have a very nice set of grunt_ operations that will not only load these dependencies, but watch\nfor changes, rebuild the sphinx demo docs and build a distributable version of the theme.\nThe bad news is this means you'll need to set up your environment similar to that\nof a front-end developer (vs. that of a python developer). That means installing node and ruby.\n\nSet up your environment\n-----------------------\n\n1. Install sphinx_ into a virtual environment.\n\n.. code::\n\n    pip install sphinx\n\n2. Install sass\n\n.. code::\n\n    gem install sass\n\n2. Install node, bower and grunt.\n\n.. code::\n\n    // Install node\n    brew install node\n\n    // Install bower and grunt\n    npm install -g bower grunt-cli\n\n    // Now that everything is installed, let's install the theme dependecies.\n    npm install\n\nNow that our environment is set up, make sure you're in your virtual environment, go to\nthis repository in your terminal and run grunt:\n\n.. code::\n\n    grunt\n\nThis default task will do the following **very cool things that make it worth the trouble**.\n\n1. It'll install and update any bower dependencies.\n2. It'll run sphinx and build new docs.\n3. It'll watch for changes to the sass files and build css from the changes.\n4. It'll rebuild the sphinx docs anytime it notices a change to .rst, .html, .js\n   or .css files.\n\n\nBefore you create an issue\n--------------------------\n\nI don't have a lot of time to maintain this project due to other responsibilities.\nI know there are a lot of Python engineers out there that can't code sass / css and\nare unable to submit pull requests. That said, submitting random style bugs without\nat least providing sample documentation that replicates your problem is a good\nway for me to ignore your request. RST unfortunately can spit out a lot of things\nin a lot of ways. I don't have time to research your problem for you, but I do\nhave time to fix the actual styling issue if you can replicate the problem for me.\n\n\nBefore you send a Pull Request\n------------------------------\n\nWhen you're done with your edits, you can run ``grunt build`` to clean out the old\nfiles and rebuild a new distribution, compressing the css and cleaning out\nextraneous files. Please do this before you send in a PR.\n\nUsing this theme locally, then building on Read the Docs?\n==========================================================\n\nCurrently if you import sphinx_ops_theme in your local sphinx build, then pass\nthat same config to Read the Docs, it will fail, since RTD gets confused. If\nyou want to run this theme locally and then also have it build on RTD, then\nyou can add something like this to your config. Thanks to Daniel Oaks for this.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # on_rtd is whether we are on readthedocs.org, this line of code grabbed from docs.readthedocs.org\n    on_rtd = os.environ.get('READTHEDOCS', None) == 'True'\n\n    if not on_rtd:  # only import and set the theme if we're building docs locally\n        import sphinx_ops_theme\n        html_theme = 'sphinx_ops_theme'\n        html_theme_path = [sphinx_ops_theme.get_html_theme_path()]\n\n    # otherwise, readthedocs.org uses their theme by default, so no need to specify it\n\nTODO\n====\n* Separate some sass variables at the theme level so you can overwrite some basic colors.",
