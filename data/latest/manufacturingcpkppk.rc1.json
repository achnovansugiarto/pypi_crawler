    "description": "# Purpose\n\nTo provide analysis tools and metrics useful in manufacturing environments.\n\nI am slowly generating the documentation and, as that is maturing, I will begin to move information\nfrom this `readme.md` into that location.  If you don't find something here, head over to the\n[documentation](https://manufacturing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n# Project Maturity\n\nEvery effort is being made to ensure that the results are accurate, but the user is ultimately\nresponsible for any resulting analysis.\n\nThe API should not be considered stable until v1.0 or greater.  Until then, breaking changes may\nbe released as different API options are explored.\n\nDuring the `v0.X.X` versioning, I am using the package in my own analyses in order to find any bugs.  Once\nI am reasonably satisfied that the package is feature complete, usable, and bug-free, I will break out\nthe `v1.X.X` releases.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Visualizations with Jupyter Notebooks\n\nVisualizations work approximately as expected within a jupyter notebook.\n\n    data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=30)  # generate some data\n    manufacturing.ppk_plot(data, lower_control_limit=-2, upper_control_limit=2)\n    \nThere is a sample jupyter notebook in the examples directory.\n\n## Cpk Visualization\n\nThe most useful feature of the `manufacturing` package is the visualization of Cpk.\nAs hinted previously, the `ppk_plot()` function is the primary method for display of\nCpk visual information.  First, get your data into a `list`, `numpy.array`, or \n`pandas.Series`; then supply that data, along with the `lower_control_limit` and \n`upper_control_limit` into the `ppk_plot()` function.\n\n    manufacturing.ppk_plot(data, lower_control_limit=-2, upper_control_limit=2)\n    \n![Screenshot](images/example3.png)\n\nIn this example, it appears that the manufacturing processes are not up to the task of \nmaking consistent product within the specified limits.\n\n## Zone Control Visualization\n\nAnother useful feature is the zone control visualization.\n\n    manufacturing.control_plot(data, lower_control_limit=-7.0, upper_control_limit=7.0)\n\n# Features Map\n\n## Analysis\n\n * ~~Ppk analysis~~\n * ~~Ppk plots/histograms~~\n * ~~Cpk analysis/plot/histogram by subgroup~~\n * ~~In-control/out-of-control analysis (do Ppk and Cpk converge to approximately the same value)~~\n * ~~Control chart plot~~ (see [Control Chart Rules](https://www.spcforexcel.com/knowledge/control-chart-basics/control-chart-rules-interpretation))\n   * ~~Beyond limits violations highlighted~~ (one or more points beyond the control limits)\n   * ~~Zone A violations highlighted~~ (2 out of 3 consecutive points in zone A or beyond)\n   * ~~Zone B violations highlighted~~ (4 out of 5 consecutive points in zone B or beyond)\n   * ~~Zone C violations highlighted~~ (7 or more consecutive points on one side of the average - in zone C or beyond)\n   * ~~Trend violations highlighted~~ (7 consecutive points trending up or down)\n   * ~~Mixture violations highlighted~~ (8 consecutive points with none in zone C)\n   * ~~Stratification violations highlighted~~ (15 consecutive points in zone C)\n   * ~~Over-control violations highlighted~~ (14 consecutive points alternating up and down)\n * Gage R&R analysis\n \n## Usability\n\n * ~~Import from CSV~~\n * ~~Import from MS Excel~~\n * Create documentation using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)\n * ~~Generate reports~~\n\n# Gallery\n\nCurrently, no distinction is made between Ppk and Cpk, so the entire chart shows the Cpk.\n\n![Ppk example](images/ppk-chart-example.png)\n\nSome of the data for the zone control chard was manipulated in order to display the results.\nNote that, if a phenomenon is not present within the data, then it will not be plotted at\nall.\n\n![Zone Control example](images/control-chart-example.png)\n\n![Cpk example](images/cpk-by-subgroups-1.png)\n\n\n",
