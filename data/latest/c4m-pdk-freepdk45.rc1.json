    "description": "# PDKMaster based FreePDK45 PDK\n\nThis is an example implementation of the non-manufacturable [FreePDK45](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK45:Contents) as a [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) based PDK under the [Chips4Makers](https://chips4makers.io) umbrella. One of it's functions is to be a guide for making new [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) PDKs for manufacturable processes.\n\n# Releases\n\nThis packages is released in two different formats. First is a release on PyPI with only the python package included. Second is a tarball release on github. Next to the installable python package also contains the generated setup files for other tools and examples of how the PDKMaster FreePDK45 can be used.\n\nCurrent release is v0.0.1:\n\n* [PyPI release](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-freepdk45/-/tree/v0.0.1/ReleaseNotes/PyPI/v0.0.1.md)\n* [tarball release](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-freepdk45/-/tree/v0.0.1/ReleaseNotes/Tarball/v0.0.1.md)\n\n# Source repository overview\n\nCurrently this repo lacks documentation. So, as an introduction to the package here an overview is given of the several parts in the repo with a short description:\n\n* `c4m/pdk/freepdk/`: The PDKMaster Technology python module, including c4m-flexcell based standard cell library.\n* `Makefile`, `scripts/`: generate several release files:\n  * copy of python module\n  * views of the standard cells using the PDKMaster export functionalities:\n    * spice netlist\n    * verilog behavioral model\n    * vhdl behavioral model\n    * gds layouts\n    * liberty file for library\n* `make_in_docker.py`: Will run the building of everything from the `Makefile` in a docker prepared docker container. Currently the the docker image to download is 2.3GB in size.\n* `design/`:\n  * `portfolio.ipynb`: Python notebook show (part of) the FreePDK45 content\n  * `arlet6502/*`: Directory with Arlet's 6502 implementation and example flow of how to do synthesis and P&R using the FreePDK45 FlexLib standard cells library. When using it from a git checkout first the coriolis files will need to be built in the top directory. In the release package this will be included and not be needed.\n    * `make_in_docker.sh`: you can also here run the flow inside a docker container of not all tools are installed locally. The same 2.3GB docker image is used for the `make_in_docker.sh` from the top directory.\n  * `inverter/inverter.ipynb`: Python notebook showing how the PDKMaster framework can be used to design a balanced inverter. It combines several design aspects in one integrated flow:\n    * spice simulation to compute the width of the inverter's NMOS and PMOS transistors to be balanced, e.g  the same on current.\n    * generate minimal area layout based on the design rules\n    * Verify functionality using Spice simulation.\n\n# Status\n\nThis repository is currently using [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) and [c4m-flexcell](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexcell) which currently have unstable APIs. Heavy non-backwards compatible changes are still be expected. If interested head over to [gitter](https://gitter.im/Chips4Makers/community) for further discussion.\n\nThe PyPi release only contains the PDKMaster Technology definition; the gitlab release also contains all the generated views and example design files.\n\n\n",
