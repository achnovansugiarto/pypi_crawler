The general quantization style implemented is affine quantization, with a focus on uniform quantization. Non-uniform quantization is currently not supported out-of-the-box.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nBrevitas serves various types of users and end goals. To showcase some of Brevitas features, we consider then different scenarios for the quantization of a classic neural network, LeNet-5.\n\n### Weights-only quantization\n\nLet's say we are interested in assessing how well the model does at *3 bit weights* for CIFAR10 classification. For the purpose of this tutorial we will skip any detail around how to perform training, as training a neural network with Brevitas is no different than training any other neural network in PyTorch.\n\n`brevitas.nn` provides quantized layers that can be used **in place of** and/or **mixed with** traditional `torch.nn` layers. \nIn this case then we import `brevitas.nn.QuantConv2d` and `brevitas.nn.QuantLinear` in place of their PyTorch variants, and we specify `weight_bit_width=3`. \nFor relu and max-pool, we leverage the usual `torch.nn.ReLU` and `torch.nn.functional.max_pool2d`. \n\nThe result is the following: \n\n```python\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom torch.nn import Module\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nimport brevitas.nn as qnn\n\n\nclass QuantWeightLeNet(Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(QuantWeightLeNet, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = qnn.QuantConv2d(3, 6, 5, weight_bit_width=3)\n        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.conv2 = qnn.QuantConv2d(6, 16, 5, weight_bit_width=3)\n        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc1   = qnn.QuantLinear(16*5*5, 120, bias=True, weight_bit_width=3)\n        self.relu3 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc2   = qnn.QuantLinear(120, 84, bias=True, weight_bit_width=3)\n        self.relu4 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc3   = qnn.QuantLinear(84, 10, bias=False, weight_bit_width=3)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        out = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = self.relu2(self.conv2(out))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = out.reshape(out.shape[0], -1)\n        out = self.relu3(self.fc1(out))\n        out = self.relu4(self.fc2(out))\n        out = self.fc3(out)\n        return out\n\nquant_weight_lenet = QuantWeightLeNet()\n\n# ... training ...\n```\n\nAt the end of training the model is going to have a certain train and test accuracy. \nFor users interested in simply evaluating how well their models do with quantization in the loop, without actually deploying them, that might be the end of it. \n\nFor those users that instead are interested in deploying their quantized models, the idea obviously would be to actually gain some kind of advantage from quantization.\nIn the case of weight quantization, the advantage would be to save space in terms of model size. However, if we saved the model state with `torch.save(quant_weight_lenet.state_dict(), 'qw_lenet.pt')` we would notice that it consumes the same amount of memory as its floating-point variant. That is because Brevitas is not concerned with deploying quantized models efficiently on its own.\nIn order to deploy the model efficiently, we have to export it to an inference framework/toolchain first. \n\nBeing a research training library that informs the development of inference toolchains, Brevitas supports more quantization schems than what can be currently accelerated efficiently by supported inference frameworks. \nA neural network with 3 bits weights and floating-point activations is one of those scenarios that in practice is currently hard to take advantage of. In order to make it practical, we want to quantize activations and biases too.\n\n### Low-precision integer-only LeNet\n\nWe decide to quantize activations to 4 bits and biases to 8 bits. In order to do so, we replace `torch.nn.ReLU` with `brevitas.nn.QuantReLU`, specifying `bit_width=4`. For bias quantization, we import the 8-bit bias quantizer `Int8Bias` from `brevitas.quant` and set it appropriately. \nAdditionally, in order to quantize the very first input, we introduce a `brevitas.nn.QuantIdentity` at the beginning of the network.\nThe end result is the following:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.nn import Module\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nimport brevitas.nn as qnn\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8Bias as BiasQuant\n\n\nclass LowPrecisionLeNet(Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(LowPrecisionLeNet, self).__init__()\n        self.quant_inp = qnn.QuantIdentity(\n            bit_width=4, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.conv1 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            3, 6, 5, weight_bit_width=3, bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu1 = qnn.QuantReLU(\n            bit_width=4, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.conv2 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            6, 16, 5, weight_bit_width=3, bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu2 = qnn.QuantReLU(\n            bit_width=4, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.fc1   = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            16*5*5, 120, bias=True, weight_bit_width=3, bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu3 = qnn.QuantReLU(\n            bit_width=4, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.fc2   = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            120, 84, bias=True, weight_bit_width=3, bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu4 = qnn.QuantReLU(\n            bit_width=4, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.fc3   = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            84, 10, bias=False, weight_bit_width=3)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        out = self.quant_inp(x)\n        out = self.relu1(self.conv1(out))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = self.relu2(self.conv2(out))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = out.reshape(out.shape[0], -1)\n        out = self.relu3(self.fc1(out))\n        out = self.relu4(self.fc2(out))\n        out = self.fc3(out)\n        return out\n```\n\nNote a couple of things:\n- Compared to the previous scenario, we now set `return_quant_tensor=True` in every quantized layer except the last one to propagate a `QuantTensor` across them. This informs each receiving layer of how activations have been quantized at the output of its predecessor, which in turns enables more functionalities, such as the kind of bias quantization here implemented.\n- `torch` operations that are algorithmically invariant to quantization, such as max-pool, can propagate QuantTensor through them without extra changes. This is supported in PyTorch 1.5.0 and later versions.\n- By default `QuantReLU` is *stateful*, so there is a difference between instantiating one `QuantReLU` that is called multiple times, and instantiating multiple `QuantReLU` that are each called once. \n\n### Dataflow FPGA acceleration with FINN \n\nThe network defined above can be mapped to a low-precision *integer-only* dataflow accelerator implemented on a Xilinx FPGA by exporting it to FINN through a custom ONNX-based representation. We can invoke the FINN export manager to do so: \n\n```python\nfrom brevitas.export import FINNManager\n\nlow_precision_lenet = LowPrecisionLeNet()\n\n# ... training ...\n\nFINNManager.export(low_precision_lenet, input_shape=(1, 3, 32, 32), export_path='finn_lenet.onnx')\n```\n\n### A mixed float-integer LeNet\n\nBrevitas also supports targeting other inference frameworks that support a mixture of floating-point and quantized layers, such as *onnxruntime* and *PyTorch* itself.\nIn this case then, `return_quant_tensor` clarifies to the export manager whether the output of a layer should be dequantized to floating-point or not.\nAdditionally, since for those target platforms low precision acceleration is not yet supported, we target 7-bit and 8-bit quantization:\n\n```python\nfrom torch import nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nimport brevitas.nn as qnn\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8WeightPerTensorFloat as SignedWeightQuant\nfrom brevitas.quant import ShiftedUint8WeightPerTensorFloat as UnsignedWeightQuant\nfrom brevitas.quant import ShiftedUint8ActPerTensorFloat as ActQuant\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8Bias as BiasQuant\n\n\nclass ReducedRangeActQuant(ActQuant):\n    bit_width = 7\n\n\nclass MixedFloatQuantLeNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, bias_quant=True, reduced_act_quant=False, weight_signed=False):\n        super(MixedFloatQuantLeNet, self).__init__()\n        \n        bias_quant   = BiasQuant if bias_quant else None\n        act_quant    = ReducedRangeActQuant if reduced_act_quant else ActQuant\n        weight_quant = SignedWeightQuant if weight_signed else UnsignedWeightQuant\n        \n        self.conv1 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            3, 6, 5, input_quant=act_quant, weight_quant=weight_quant,\n            output_quant=act_quant, bias_quant=bias_quant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.conv2 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            6, 16, 5, weight_quant=weight_quant, output_quant=act_quant,\n            bias_quant=bias_quant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc1   = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            16*5*5, 120, bias=True, weight_quant=weight_quant,\n            bias_quant=bias_quant, output_quant=act_quant)\n        self.relu3 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc2   = nn.Linear(120, 84, bias=True)\n        self.relu4 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc3   = nn.Linear(84, 10, bias=False)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        out = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = self.relu2(self.conv2(out))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = out.reshape(out.shape[0], -1)\n        out = self.relu3(self.fc1(out))\n        out = self.relu4(self.fc2(out))\n        out = self.fc3(out)\n        return out\n\n\n```\n\nCompared to the previous case, there are a few differences: \n- While in the previous example the default *scaled integer* quantized was being adopted for weights and activations, and only a bit-width was specified, here the network is compeltely parametrized by standalone quantizers taken from `brevitas.quant`. This is to match the quantization schemes supported by the inference frameworks we are targeting.\n- We are defining a 7-bit activation quantizer by inheriting from an existing one and setting`bit_width=7`. This is an alternative but equivalent syntax to setting the attribute as a keyword argument.\n- In this scenario activations are quantized before *relu* by setting output quantizers on `QuantConv2d` and `QuantLinear`. Again this matches how the frameworks we are targeting work. Because of this, we revert to using standard `torch.nn.ReLU`.\n\n### Export to standard ONNX\n\nAfter training, the above network can then be exported to an ONNX representation that complies with the [standard opset](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md):\n\n```python\nfrom brevitas.export import StdQOpONNXManager\n\nonnx_lenet = MixedFloatQuantLeNet()\n\n# ... training ...\n\nStdQOpONNXManager.export(onnx_lenet, input_shape=(1, 3, 32, 32), export_path='onnx_lenet.onnx')\n```\n\n### Acceleration with onnxruntime\n\nThe generated output model can then be accelerated through any ONNX-compliant inference framework, such as *onnxruntime*:\n\n```python\nimport onnxruntime as rt\nimport numpy as np\n\nsess = rt.InferenceSession('onnx_lenet.onnx')\ninput_name = sess.get_inputs()[0].name\npred_onx = sess.run(None, {input_name: np.random.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)})[0]\n```\n\n### Export to PyTorch quantized inference ops\n\nWith the same network definition it's also possible to target [PyTorch's own quantized inference operators](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.nn.quantized.html):\n\n```python\nfrom brevitas.export import PytorchQuantManager\n\npt_lenet = MixedFloatQuantLeNet(bias_quant=False, reduced_act_quant=True, weight_signed=True)\n\n# ... training ...\n\ntraced_pt_lenet = PytorchQuantManager.export(pt_lenet, input_shape=(1, 3, 32, 32))\n```\n\nNote how the network was parametrized to reflect a few of the differences between PyTorch quantized inference operators and the standard ONNX opset: \n- Pytorch doesn't support explicit bias quantization, standard ONNX does. \n- We pick an 8-bit signed symmetric weights quantizer for PyTorch (the one used by default for weight quantization in Brevitas), while for ONNX we go for an unsigned asymmetric one, since support for it in onnxruntime is more mature. \n- With the FBGEMM x86 backend (which is enabled by default), PyTorch recommends to use 7-bit activations to avoid overflow.\n\n### Export to TVM\n\nThe PyTorch export flow generates a TorchScript model, which means that the network can also easily be passed to any external toolchain that supports TorchScript, such as *TVM*:\n\n```python\nfrom tvm import relay\n\ninput_name = \"input\"  \ninput_shapes = [(input_name, (1, 3, 224, 224))]\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_pytorch(traced_pt_lenet, input_shapes)\n```\n\n### Fixed-point quantization for Xilinx DPUs\n\nThanks to their flexibility, Xilinx FPGAs support a variety of neural network hardware implementations. \nDPUs are a family of fixed-point neural network accelerators officially supported as part of the Vitis-AI toolchain.\nCurrently Brevitas supports training for DPUs by leveraging 8-bit fixed-point quantizers and a custom ONNX based export flow that targets PyXIR:\n\n```python\nfrom torch import nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nimport brevitas.nn as qnn\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8WeightPerTensorFixedPoint as WeightQuant\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8ActPerTensorFixedPoint as ActQuant\nfrom brevitas.quant import Int8BiasPerTensorFixedPointInternalScaling as BiasQuant\nfrom brevitas.export import PyXIRManager\n\n\nclass DPULeNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(DPULeNet, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            3, 6, 5, input_quant=ActQuant, weight_quant=WeightQuant,\n            output_quant=ActQuant, bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.conv2 = qnn.QuantConv2d(\n            6, 16, 5, weight_quant=WeightQuant, output_quant=ActQuant,\n            bias_quant=BiasQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc1 = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            16*5*5, 120, bias=True, weight_quant=WeightQuant,\n            bias_quant=BiasQuant, output_quant=ActQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu3 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc2 = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            120, 84, bias=True, weight_quant=WeightQuant,\n            bias_quant=BiasQuant, output_quant=ActQuant, return_quant_tensor=True)\n        self.relu4 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.fc3 = qnn.QuantLinear(\n            84, 10, bias=False, weight_quant=WeightQuant, output_quant=ActQuant)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        out = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = self.relu2(self.conv2(out))\n        out = F.max_pool2d(out, 2)\n        out = out.reshape(out.shape[0], -1)\n        out = self.relu3(self.fc1(out))\n        out = self.relu4(self.fc2(out))\n        out = self.fc3(out)\n        return out\n\n\ndpu_lenet = DPULeNet()\n\n# ... training ...\n\nPyXIRManager.export(dpu_lenet, input_shape=(1, 3, 32, 32), export_path='pyxir_lenet.onnx')\n\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is currently a work-in-progress.  \nA series of tutorials is being added to the *notebooks* folder. They are designed to walk users through some of the fundamentals of Brevitas, and as such they are meant to be followed in order.  \nA general description of how Brevitas works can be found under the *ARCHITECTURE.md* file.\n\n## Settings\n\nBrevitas exposes a few settings that can be toggled through env variables.\n\n- **BREVITAS_JIT=1** (*Default: = 0*): Enables compilation of the available built-in quantizers through TorchScript just-in-time compiler, \n  together with a small native .cpp extension for the straight-through estimator functions. This can provide a speed-up and/or memory savings at training time. \n\n- **BREVITAS_VERBOSE=1** (*Default: = 0*): Enables verbose compilation of the straight-through estimator functions native extension.\n\n- **BREVITAS_IGNORE_MISSING_KEYS=1** (*Default: =0*): Ignore errors related to missing *state_dict* values when loading a pre-trained model on top of a Brevitas model.\n    This is typically enabled when re-training from a floating-point checkpoint.\n\n## F.A.Q.\n\n**Q: Pytorch supports quantization-aware training. Why should I use Brevitas?**\n\n**A:** Quantization in Pytorch is currently designed to target two specific CPU backends (FBGEMM and qnnpack).\nBrevitas is designed as a platform to target a variety of hardware backends adhering to a loose set of assumptions (i.e. uniform affine quantization), through either existing quantization algorithms, or by implementing new ones.\n\n**Q: How can I train X/Y and run it on hardware W/Z? I can't find any documentation.**\n\n**A:** Brevitas is still sparsely documented. Until the situation improves, feel free to open an issue or ask on our gitter channel.\n\n\n**Q: Training with Brevitas is slow and/or I can't fit the same batch size as with floating-point training. Why? What can I do?**\n\n**A:** Quantization-aware training involves a lot of element-wise operations, \nwhich carry low arithmetic intensity and contribute to a more involved computational graph during backpropragation. \nAs such, it typically ends up being slower and more resource-intensive than standard floating-point training. \n\nBrevitas in particular is biased towards greater flexibility, at the cost of some training-time effieciency. \nThe general principle is that it's trading off more complexity at training time for more efficiency at inference time.\n\nTo mitigate somewhat the slow-down, try enabling *BREVITAS_JIT* as reported in the *Settings* section.\n\n\n**Q: Inference with Brevitas is slow. I thought the point of QAT was to make my model faster at inference time. What I am doing wrong?**\n\n**A:** Brevitas is concerned with modelling a reduced precision data-path, it does not provide inference-time acceleration on its own. \nTo achieve acceleration, you should export your Brevitas model to a downstream toolchain / backend. \n\nBrevitas can currently export to:\n- FINN  - for dataflow acceleration on Xilinx FPGAs. \n- PyXIR (*experimental*) - for DPU acceleration on Xilinx FPGAs. \n- Standard ONNX (*experimental*) - for acceleration with e.g. onnxruntime, or any other ONNX-compliant toolchain.\n- Pytorch's *quantized.functional* operators (*experimental*) - for acceleration through Pytorch itself,\n  or any additional downstream toolchains supported by Pytorch (e.g. TVM).\n\nBecause Brevitas implements a super-set of layers and datatypes supported by various downstream toolchains and hardware platforms, \nthe result is that each export flow supports only a certain subset of features, in ways that are not necessarely obvious. \nMore examples and documentation will be released to illustrate the various restrictions imposed by each target platform.\nAs a general note though, currently FINN is the only toolchain that supports acceleration of low bit-width datatypes.\n\n**Q: My (C/G/T)PU supports float16 / bfloat16 / bfloat19 training. Can I use it to train with Brevitas?**\n\n**A:** Datatypes outside of float32 at training time have not been tested. That includes training on TPU / Pytorch-XLA.\nDo the math in terms of which reduced-precision integers can reasonably fit in a reduced-precision \nfloating-point format at training time, and use at your own risk.\n\n\n## Author\n\nAlessandro Pappalardo (@volcacius) @ Xilinx Research Labs.\nFor private communications, you can reach me at *alessand at name_of_my_employer dot com*.\n\n\n\n",
