    "description": "# B-cos Networks v2\nM. BÃ¶hle, N. Singh, M. Fritz, B. Schiele.\n\nImproved B-cos Networks.\n\nIf you want to take a quick look at the explanations the models generate, \nyou can try out the Gradio web demo on [ðŸ¤— Spaces](https://gradio.app/g/B-cos/B-cos-v2).\n\nIf you prefer a more hands-on approach, \nyou can take a look at the [demo notebook on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bdc1zdIVvv7XUJj8B8Toe6VMPYAsIT9w?usp=sharing).\nor load the models directly via torch hub as explained below.\n\n\n## Quick Start\nLoading the models via torch hub is as easy as:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# list all available models\ntorch.hub.list('B-cos/B-cos-v2')\n\n# load a pretrained model\nmodel = torch.hub.load('B-cos/B-cos-v2', 'resnet50', pretrained=True)\n```\n\nInference and explanation visualization is as simple as:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# load image\nimg = model.transform(Image.open('cat.jpg'))\nimg = img[None].requires_grad_()\n\n# predict and explain\nmodel.eval()\nexpl_out = model.explain(img)\nprint(\"Prediction:\", expl_out[\"prediction\"])  # predicted class idx\nplt.imshow(expl_out[\"explanation\"])\nplt.show()\n```\n\nSee the [demo notebook](demo.ipynb) for more details.\n\n\n\n# *Stay tuned, more info to come soon!*\n",
