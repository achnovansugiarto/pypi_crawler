    "description": "## Tidesign\n\n> Recipes for experimental designs\n\n## Quick start\n\n`tidesign` aims to ...\n\n### Installing the project\n\nUsers can install project from github using `pip`:\n\n```console\npip install tidesign@git+https://github.com/quara-dev/tidesign.git\n```\n\nConfirm that project is installed correctly by importing the version string:\n\n```python\nfrom tidesign import __version__\nprint(__version__)\n```\n\n## Developer installation\n\nRun the `install.py` script located in the `scripts/` directory with the Python interpreter of your choice. The script accepts the following arguments:\n\n- `--dev`: install extra dependencies required to contribute to development\n- `--docs`: install extra dependencies required to build and serve documentation\n- `-e` or `--extras`: a string of comma-separated extras such as `\"dev,docs\"`.\n- `-a` or `--all`: a boolean flag indicating that all extras should be installed.\n\nExample usage:\n\n- Install with build extra only (default behaviour)\n\n```console\npython3 scripts/install.py\n```\n\n- Install with dev extra\n\n```console\npython3 scripts/install.py --dev\n```\n\n- Install all extras\n\n```console\npython3 scripts/install.py --all\n```\n\n> Note: The `venv` module must be installed for the python interpreter used to run install script. On Debian and Ubuntu systems, this package can be installed using the following command: `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`. On Windows systems, python distributions have the `venv` module installed by default.\n\nThe [install.py](./scripts/install.py) script is responsible for first creating a virtual environment, then updating packaging dependencies such as `pip`, `setuptools` and `wheel` within the virtual environment. It then install the project dependencies, and finally, it installs the project in development mode within the virtual environment.\n\n> The virtual environment is always named `.venv/`\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\n### Development tasks\n\nThe file [`tasks.py`](./tasks.py) is an [invoke]() [task file](). It describes several tasks which developers can execute to perform various actions.\n\nTo list all available tasks, activate the project virtual environment, and run the command `inv --list`:\n\n```console\n$ inv --list\n\nAvailable tasks:\n\n  build         Build sdist and wheel, and optionally build documentation.\n  requirements  Generate requirements.txt file\n  check         Run mypy typechecking.\n  coverage      Serve code coverage results and optionally run tests before serving results\n  docker        Build cross-platform docker image for the project\n  docs          Serve the documentation in development mode.\n  format        Format source code using black and isort.\n  lint          Lint source code using flake8.\n  test          Run tests using pytest and optionally enable coverage.\n  wheelhouse    Build wheelhouse for the project\n```\n\n#### Build project artifacts\n\nThe `build` task can be used to build a [source distribution (`sdist`)](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/distutils/sourcedist.html), a [wheel binary package](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) by default.\n\nOptionally, it can be used to build the project documentation as a static website.\n\nUsage:\n\n- Build `sdist` and `wheel` only:\n\n```console\ninv build\n```\n\n- Build `sdist`, `wheel` and documentation:\n\n```console\ninv build --docs\n```\n\n#### Building wheelhouse\n\nThe `wheelhouse` task can be used to generate an [installation bundle](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/repeatable-installs/#using-a-wheelhouse-aka-installation-bundles) also known as a wheelhouse.\n\n> pip wheel can be used to generate and package all of a projectâ€™s dependencies, with all the compilation performed, into a single directory that can be converted into a single archive. This archive then allows installation when index servers are unavailable and avoids time-consuming recompilation.\n\nThis command does not accept any argument, and generates the wheelhouse into `dist/wheelhouse`.\n\n#### Run tests\n\nThe `test` task can be used to run tests using `pytest`.\n\nBy default, test coverage is not enabled and `-c` or `--cov` option must be provided to enable test coverage.\n\nUsage:\n\n- Run tests without coverage:\n\n```console\ninv test\n```\n\n- Run tests with coverage:\n\n```console\ninv test --cov\n```\n\n#### Visualize test coverage\n\nThe `coverage` task can be used to serve test coverage results on `http://localhost:8000` by default. Use `--port` option to use a different port.\n\nBy default, test coverage is expected to be present before running the task. If it is desired to run tests before serving the results, use `--run` option.\n\n#### Run typechecking\n\nThe `check` task can be used to run [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nBy default type checking is not run on tests and `-i` or `--include-tests` option must be provided to include them.\n\n#### Run linter\n\nThe `lint` task can be used to lint source code using [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). This task does not accept any option.\n\n> `flake8` is configured in the [setup.cfg](./setup.cfg) file.\n\n#### Format source code\n\nThe `format` task can be used to format source code using [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [`isort`](https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This task does not accept any option.\n\n> `black` is not configured in any way, but `isort` is configured in [setup.cfg](./setup.cfg).\n\n#### Serve the documentation\n\nThe `docs` task can be used to serve the documentation as a static website on <http://localhost:8000> with auto-reload enabled by default. Use the `--port` option to change the listenning port and the `--no-watch` to disable auto-reload.\n\n#### Build Docker image\n\n\nThe `docker` task can be used to build a Docker image for the project. The Dockerfile can be found at the root of the repository. By default, image is built for `linux/amd64` only. Use `--platform` argument to build image for different architectures.\n\n> Use `inv docker --help` to learn about allowed options.\n\n\n### Git flow\n\nTwo branches exist:\n\n- `next`: The development branch. All developers must merge commits to `next` through Pull Requests.\n\n- `main`: The release branch. Developers must not commit to this branch. Only merge from `next` branch with fast-forward strategy are allowed on `main` branch. \n\n> Each time new commits are pushed on `main`, semantic-release may perform a release bump according to commit messages.\n\n### Git commits \n\nDevelopers are execpted to write commit messages according to the [Convetionnal Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.\n\n> Commit messages which are not valid conventionnal commits are ignored in changelog.\n\n### Changelog\n\nChangelog is generated for each release candidate and each release according to commit messages found since last release.\n\nChangelog content is written to [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) by [@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator) plugin configured with [`conventionnalcommit`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) preset.\n\n### Contributing to the documentation\n\nProject documentation is written using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator. Documentation source files are written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). They can be found in [docs/](./docs/) directory.\n\nAside from documentation written in markdown files, Python API reference is generated from docstrings and type annotations found in source code.\n",
