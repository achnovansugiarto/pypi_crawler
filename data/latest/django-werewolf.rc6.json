    "description": "Package\n==================================\ndjango-werewolf\n\nDescription\n==================================\nItem publishing workflow for Django (fully integrated into Django admin).\n\nPrerequisites\n===================================\n- Django 1.5.+\n- Python 2.6.8+, 2.7.+, 3.3.+\n\nInstallation\n==================================\n1. Install django-werewolf into your virtual environment:\n\n    $ pip install django-werewolf\n\n2. Add `werewolf` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.\n\nThat's all. See the `Usage and examples` section for more.\n\nUsage and examples\n==================================\nIt's all about item publishing in a workflow. We have various `intermediate` statuses (work in-progress) and a\nfinal `status` which means that the item is actually published. Some users should be able to set the item status\nto `published`, some others not. This app allows you (and gives you a good working example with pre-configured\nDjango environment) to write a custom workflow for publishing your items with minimal efforts.\n\nFor a complete example of a working django-werewolf app see the\n(https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-werewolf/tree/stable/example) and read the `readme.rst` of the `news`\napp.\n\nImaginary app concept\n-----------------------------------\nThere are three user groups. All of them should be able to log into Django admin.\n\n- Writers\n- Editors\n- Chief Editors\n\nIn short, our imaginary app would work as follows.\n\n- Chief Editor creates a News item and chooses a Writer and an Editor. The status of a new News item is\n  then set to `new`.\n- Once a News item with status `new` has been created, both Writer and the Editor assigned do get an e-mail \n  notification about the fact that a News item has been assigned to them.\n- Writer is supposed to fill the assigned News item with content and once the News item is ready, change\n  its' status to `ready`.\n- The assigned Editor would get an e-mail notification about the fact that the News item has been changed to\n  `ready`.\n- The assigned Editor is supposed to check the News item  with status `ready` and if it's acceptable, change\n  the News item status to `reviewed`.\n- Once a News item status has been set to `reviewed`, the assigned Writer can no longer access it in the Django\n  admin.\n- The assigned Chief Editor would get an e-mail notification about the fact that the News item has been changed\n  to `reviewed.`\n- The assigned Chief Editor is supposed to check the News item with status `reviewed` and if it acceptable, \n  change the News item status to `published`.\n- Once a News item status has been set to `published`, the assigned Editor can no longer access it in the Django\n  admin.\n- Once a News item status has been changed to `published`, all Chief Editors in the system, as well as the\n  assigned Writer and Editor get an e-mail notification about the fact that the News item has been published.\n\nDemo\n-----------------------------------\nIn order to be able to quickly evaluate the django-werewolf, a demo app (with a quick installer) has been created\n(Debian only). Follow the instructions below for having the demo running within a minute.\n\nGrab the latest `django-werewolf-example-app-install.sh`\n\n    $ wget https://raw.github.com/barseghyanartur/django-werewolf/stable/django-werewolf-example-app-install.sh\n\nCreate a new- or switch to existing- virtual environement, assign execute rights to the installer and run\nthe `django-werewolf-example-app-install.sh`.\n\n    $ chmod +x django-werewolf-example-app-install.sh\n\n    $ ./django-werewolf-example-app-install.sh\n\nGo to the backend and test the app.\n\n- URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/admin/news/newsitem/\n- Admin username: admin\n- Admin password: test\n- Chief Editor username: chief_editor\n- Chief Editor password: test\n- Editor username: editor\n- Editor password: test\n- Writer username: writer\n- Writer password: test\n\nLet's now step-by-step review our imaginary example app.\n\nsettings.py\n----------------------------------\n>>> # Workflow statuses; order is preserved.\n>>> WEREWOLF_STATUS_CHOICES = (\n>>>     ('new', gettext('New')), # New - this is how it's assigned to a writer.\n>>>     ('draft', gettext('Draft')), # Draft - this is how the writer works on it.\n>>>     ('ready', gettext('Ready')), # Ready to be reviewed by editor.\n>>>     ('reviewed', gettext('Reviewed')), # Reviewed by editor (means positive\n>>>                                        # and ready to be published).\n>>>     ('published', gettext('Published')), # Published.\n>>> )\n>>>\n>>> # Published status.\n>>> WEREWOLF_STATUS_PUBLISHED = 'published'\n>>>\n>>> # When set to True, django-reversion is used.\n>>> WEREWOLF_USE_DJANGO_REVERSION = True\n\nnews/models.py\n----------------------------------\nIn the example below we have a basic news item model. We have Chief Editors with full access to news items, we\nhave editors with less privelleges and Writers with very little privelleges. Chief Editors create articles,\nselect an Editor and a Writer (both get notified) and let them work on the article. Writers can only set an\narticle status to `new`, `draft` and `ready` (ready to be checked). Editors review the articles with status\n`ready` and set the status to `reviewed`. Chief Editors publish articles that are `reviewed`. Your\nimplementation can be as custom as you want it. Think in Django user groups (``django.contrib.auth.models.Group``)\nand Django permissions system.\n\nNOTE: See the `Permission tuning` section.\n\n>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n>>>\n>>> from werewolf.models import WerewolfBaseModel, WerewolfBaseMeta\n>>>\n>>> _chief_editors = {'groups__name__iexact': 'Chief editors'}\n>>> _editors = {'groups__name__iexact': 'Editors'}\n>>> _writers = {'groups__name__iexact': 'Writers'}\n>>>\n>>> class NewsItem(WerewolfBaseModel): # Important!\n>>>     title = models.CharField(_(\"Title\"), max_length=100)\n>>>     body = models.TextField(_(\"Body\"))\n>>>     date_published = models.DateTimeField(_(\"Date published\"), \\\n>>>                                           default=datetime.datetime.now())\n>>>     author = models.ForeignKey(User, verbose_name=_(\"Author\"), \\\n>>>                                related_name='authors', \\\n>>>                                limit_choices_to=_writers)\n>>>     editor = models.ForeignKey(User, verbose_name=_(\"Editor\"), \\\n>>>                                related_name='editors', \\\n>>>                                limit_choices_to=_editors)\n>>>     chief_editor = models.ForeignKey(User, verbose_name=_(\"Chief editor\"), \\\n>>>                                      related_name='chief_editors', \\\n>>>                                      limit_choices_to=_chief_editors)\n>>>\n>>>     class Meta(WerewolfBaseMeta): # Important!\n>>>         verbose_name = \"News item\"\n>>>         verbose_name_plural = \"News items\"\n\nOr if you want to define custom permissions for your model as well, do extend the django-werewolf\npermissions as follows:\n\n>>> from werewolf.models import WerewolfBaseModel\n>>> from werewolf.utils import extend_werewolf_permissions\n>>>\n>>> class NewsItem(WerewolfBaseModel):\n>>>     # Your fields here\n>>>     class Meta:\n>>>         verbose_name = \"News item\"\n>>>         verbose_name_plural = \"News items\"\n>>>\n>>>         # Important!\n>>>         permissions = extend_werewolf_permissions(\n>>>             ('can_change_author', _(\"Can change author\")),\n>>>             ('can_change_editor', _(\"Can change editor\")),\n>>>             ('can_change_chief_editor', _(\"Can change chief editor\"))\n>>>         )\n\nnews/admin.py\n----------------------------------\nBasic admin for the news item model.\n\nNOTE: See the `Permission tuning` section.\n\n>>> from werewolf.admin import WerewolfBaseAdmin\n>>>\n>>> from news.models import NewsItem\n>>>\n>>> class NewsItemAdmin(WerewolfBaseAdmin):\n>>>     werewolf_protected_fields = (\n>>>         ('author', 'can_change_author'),\n>>>         ('editor', 'can_change_editor'),\n>>>         ('chief_editor', 'can_change_chief_editor')\n>>>     )\n>>>\n>>> admin.site.register(NewsItem, NewsItemAdmin)\n\nThe ``werewolf_protected_fields`` property is a list of fields that are supposed to be protected. Each item in\nthe list is a tuple of (``field_name_to_protect``, ``required_permission``). If given, django-werewolf hides\nfields listed as protected from users that do not have the permission required. In order to do so, django-werewolf\noverrides the Django's ModelAdmin ``get_field`` and ``get_fieldsets`` methods. If you happen to override that\nmethod for your own needs, make sure the it also reflects the django-werewolf concepts.\n\nNOTE: If you override the ``queryset`` method of your model's admin class, make sure to see the source code\nof `werewolf.admin.WerewolfBaseAdmin.queryset` and copy the approach from there. Otherwise, your users with\nno permission to change the `published` status will be able to chgange the status of already published items\nto non-published statuses.\n\nnews/views.py\n----------------------------------\n>>> from news.models import NewsItem\n>>>\n>>> def browse(request):\n>>>     news_items = NewsItem._default_manager.published()\n>>>     # Other code\n\nnews/werewolf_triggers.py\n----------------------------------\nIn order to perform extra tasks on status change, triggers are used. You simply make a new file in your app\ncalled `werewolf_triggers.py` and define custom classes that should be called when a ``status`` field of your\nmodel changes to a certain value. Each trigger should subclass the ``werewolf.triggers.WerewolfBaseTrigger``\nclass.\n\n>>> from werewolf.triggers import WerewolfBaseTrigger, registry\n>>>\n>>> class StatusNewTrigger(WerewolfBaseTrigger):\n>>>     \"\"\"\n>>>     News item status changed to `new`.\n>>>     \"\"\"\n>>>     def process(self):\n>>>         # Your code\n>>>\n>>> class StatusReadyTrigger(WerewolfBaseTrigger):\n>>>     \"\"\"\n>>>     News item status changed to `ready` (ready for review).\n>>>     \"\"\"\n>>>     def process(self):\n>>>         # Your code\n>>>\n>>> # Triggers status change to `new` for news.newsitem model.\n>>> registry.register('news', 'newsitem', 'new', StatusNewTrigger)\n>>>\n>>> # Triggers status change to `ready` for news.newsitem model.\n>>> registry.register('news', 'newsitem', 'ready', StatusReadyTrigger)\n\nurls.py\n----------------------------------\nIn order to have triggers autodiscovered, place the following code into your main `urls` module.\n\n>>> from werewolf import autodiscover as werewolf_autodiscover\n>>> werewolf_autodiscover()\n\nPermission tuning\n----------------------------------\nHave in mind our ``news.models.NewsItem`` model.\n\n1. Create three user groups:\n\n    a.  Chief editors (permissions listed):\n\n    - news | News item | Can add News item\n    - news | News item | Can change author\n    - news | News item | Can change chief editor\n    - news | News item | Can change editor\n    - news | News item | Can change News item\n    - news | News item | Can change status to draft\n    - news | News item | Can change status to new\n    - news | News item | Can change status to published\n    - news | News item | Can change status to ready\n    - news | News item | Can change status to reviewed\n    - news | News item | Can delete News item\n\n    b. Editors (permissions listed):\n\n    - news | News item | Can change News item\n    - news | News item | Can change author\n    - news | News item | Can change status to draft\n    - news | News item | Can change status to new\n    - news | News item | Can change status to ready\n    - news | News item | Can change status to reviewed\n\n    c. Writers (permissions listed):\n\n    - news | News item | Can change News item\n    - news | News item | Can change status to draft\n    - news | News item | Can change status to new\n    - news | News item | Can change status to ready\n\n3. Create three users:\n\n    - chief editor: Belongs to group `Chief editors`.\n    - editor: Belongs to group `Editors`.\n    - writer: Belongs to group `Writers`.\n\n4. Now log into the admin with different user and see your admin for the `News item` (created items with \n   `chiefeditor` account, then view them with `editor` and `writer`.\n\nThat's it. If somehow you don't see the new permissions (`Can change status to draft`,\n`Can change status to new`, etc) run a management command `syncww`:\n\n    $ ./manage.py syncww\n\nRunning the example project\n==================================\nA working example of a django-werewolf app is available here:\nhttps://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-werewolf/tree/stable/example\n\n1. Go to example/example directory\n\n    $ cd example/example\n\n2. Install requirements (in your virtual environment)\n\n    $ pip install -r ../requirements.txt\n\n3. Copy local_settings.example to local_settings.py\n\n    $ cp local_settings.example local_settings.py\n\n4. Create the database\n\n    $ ./manage.py syncdb\n\n5. Insert example test groups and users\n\n    $ ./manage.py news_create_groups_and_test_users\n\n6. Run the project\n\n    $ ./manage.py runserver\n\nLicense\n==================================\nGPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1\n\nSupport\n==================================\nFor any issues contact me at the e-mail given in the `Author` section.\n\nAuthor\n==================================\nArtur Barseghyan <artur.barseghyan@gmail.com>",
