    "description": "# ccfrobot\n\nThe `ccfrobot` (Cloud Code Framework Robot) is a programmable automaton for automating creative tasks that occur when working with the [Cloud Code Framework (CCF)](). It implements all CCF models, as well as skills, that are not destructive. In addition, it offers a *CLI*, as well as *HTTP-REST* APIs.\n\nIt is authored in *Python3* and is compatible with UN*X, as well as NT platforms.\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis software is licensed under the open-source copyleft *GNU Affero General Public License*. Please refer to the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file at the repository root for more information.\n\n## Support\n\nCommercial support is available through the [Innovations ON GmbH](https://inno-on.de). Innovations ON is a managed cloud provider, as well as multi-cloud consultancy, located in Germany.\n\nContact <<t.rodney@inno-on.de>>, for more information.\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\nccfrobot is being installed as a Python3 module, which can then be called e.g.  via CLI like`python3 -m ccfrobot create framework .`. There are multiple ways on how to install a Python3 module. Please refer to the [`INSTALL`](INSTALL) file for more information on standard installations.\n\nFor more information on utilization, please refer to the official documentation of [`ccfrobot`](), as well as the Cloud Code Framework specifications ([`ccfspec`]()).\n\n## Development\n\nThis project provides an *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE) for UN*X and NT platforms.\n\n### Isolated Development \n\nIsolated development does not require interfacing with other applications. If e.g. the development tasks one has to undertake requires interfacing with the `aws-cli` or `terraform`, then this is not an isolated development task. Isolated development, in most cases, is platform-agnostic, meaning that it can be done on either UN*X, or NT platform without any real means of virtualization.\n\nIsolated development can be done through `pipenv`.\n\n1. Install `pipenv` (through PyPI/pip), by executing `pip install --upgrade pipenv`.\n\n2. Install development dependencies by first creating a `.venv/` directory inside the repository base directory (not required<sup>1</sup>), then executing `pipenv install -d .`.\n\n3. For an interactive shell session, execute `pipenv shell`.\n\n> <sup>1</sup> if one creates a .venv directory, `pipenv` will install all dependencies inside said directory, instead of in a pipenv-managed directory.\n\n### Integrative Development\n\nIntegrative development. in contrast to isolated development, requires interfacing with other applications.\n\nIntegrative development can be done through `docker`.\n\n1. Build the `ccfrobot` Docker development image by executing `docker build -t local/ccfrobot-devel -f Dockerfile.devel .`\n\n2. To create an interactive<sup>1</sup> container, execute `docker run -it -v \"$( pwd ):/root\" local/ccfrobot-devel /bin/sh` on UN*X paltforms, or `docker run -it -v \"$()\":/root\" local/ccfrobot-devel /bin/sh` on NT platforms.\n\nIf you want to statically lock all integration requirements within a Docker image, create a new `Dockerfile`<sup>1</sup> that references the previously created `local/ccfrobot-devel` (`FROM local/ccfrobot-devel`) and install all integration requirements accordingly.\n\n> <sup>1</sup> mount the repository base directory to the `root`'s home directory (`/root/`), enabling one to execute the application inside the container, whilst modifying the source code on the local system.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting assures, that an application functions as intended by design. One can also use testing as a development guideline, in order to design application components (functions, classes, objects, etc.), that are isolated and self-reliant, and therefore easy to test.\n\nA testing suite is a structured collection of tests, that can be executed in an arbitrary order.\n\nA test coverage report reflects on what, and how many of the actual code execution (and therefore source code) has been tested. It is this project's goal to reach a testing coverage of at least 90%.\n\nThis project uses `tox`, `pytest`, and `pytest-cov` for testing, in accordance with the guidelines layed out by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA). \n\n### Suite\n\nTo execute the entire `ccfrobot` (unit, and integration) testing suite, execute `pipenv run tox -e unit`. This will also create *junit* compatible test-reports in XML format. Alternatively, execute the following command:\n\n```sh\npipenv run \\\n\tpytest \\\n\t\t-v \\\n\t\t--junitxml=test-reports/tox-integration.xml\n```\n\nIf you want to run a single test, e.g. `tests/model/test_framework.py::Test__init::test_pass0`, execute:\n\n```sh\npipenv run \\\n\ttox -e 'unit' -- \\\n\t\t'tests/model/test_framework.py::Test__init::test_pass0'\n```\n\n### Coverage\n\nTo generate a test-coverage report (in HTML format) for the entire Python `ccfrobot` package, execute `pipenv run tox -e coverage`. Alternatively, execute the following command:\n\n```sh\npipenv run \\\n\tpytest \\ \n\t\t-v \\\n\t\t--cov=ccfrobot \\\n\t\t--cov-report html:test-reports/coverage.html\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation gives information to developers, as well as users, on how to interact with the application. This software's documentation is authored using Restructured Text (ResT) and `sphinx` and can be exported to a number of formats, including HTML, Markdown, LaTex, as well as PDF.\n\nDocumentation can be generated through `pipenv`.\n\n1. Install `pipenv` (through PyPI/pip), by executing `pip install --upgrade pipenv`.\n\n2. Create `./docs/.venv` (not required), and change your working directory to `./docs`. Then, execute `pipenv install -d`.\n\n3. Execute `pipenv run make html`<sup>1</sup>, to generate documentation in HTML format on UN*X platforms, or `pipenv make.bat html` on NT platforms.\n\n4. The generated documentation can be found under `./build/docs`.\n\n> <sup>1</sup> On UN*X platforms, this requires `GNU make` to be installed.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe package is meant to be made available via PyPI.\n\n\n- `TWINE_USERNAME`\n- `TWINE_PASSWORD`\n\n",
