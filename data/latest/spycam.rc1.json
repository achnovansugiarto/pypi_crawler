    "description": "# SpyCam\n\nThe SpyCam system is the result of a design course assignment at the University of Cape Town in 2020. This system provides a full demonstrator and API of a low-power, Embedded Systems implementation of mechanical pan and tilt camera arm with facial detection. This project inspired us to create a high-quality yet affordable security alternative to families living within the dangerous parts of South Africa.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to achieve the correct results, we suggest you use the following equipment:\n* Raspberry Pi 3B+ or higher\n* Pimoroni Pan-Tilt Board\n* Pimoroni Dual Servo Mechanism\n* Standard Power Adapter for Raspberry Pi (A USB power cable might not work)\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install opencv.\n\n```bash\npip install opencv-contrib-python\npip install pantilthat\npip install imutils\npip install \"picamera[array]\"\n```\n* Please note that in order to reliably use the SpyCam Demonstrator and API, it is suggested you work with Python 3 and was tested on Python 3.7 on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+\n\n## Usage\nThe demonstrator currently consists of two different methods of operation:\n1. Autonomous Haar-Cascade Model Facial Detection\n2. Manual override of operation through a local webserver\n\nIf you are a beginner or would like to simply try the demonstrator of the system, use the following command line where the downloaded files have been extracted:\n\n```python\npython3 spycam.py\n```\nFor more experienced users, you can use the direct command line interface:\n```python\npython3 pan_tilt_tracking.py --cascade haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml\n```\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\nPlease make sure to update tests as appropriate.\n\n## Other notes from the Dev Team\nWe hope this helps anyone inside or outside of South Africa! This design was inspired by Adrian Rosebrock at https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ , please give it a look and support him if possible.\n\n\nChange Log\n===========\n\n0.01 (19/11/2020)\n--------------------\n- First Release",
