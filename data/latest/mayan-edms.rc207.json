Its main purpose is to store,\nintrospect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the\ncontextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,\nlabel, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest\nare its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.\n\n.. image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/raw/master/docs/_static/overview.gif\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n\nThe easiest way to use Mayan EDMS is by using the official Docker_ image.\nMake sure Docker is properly installed and working before attempting to install\nMayan EDMS.\n\nFor the complete set of installation instructions visit the Mayan EDMS documentation\nat: https://docs.mayan-edms.com/parts/installation.html\n\n.. _Docker: https://www.docker.com/\n\nThe final version of the book \"Exploring Mayan EDMS\" available now!\n\n.. image:: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/89d2fe787507c9247aa7bb406e2682b53eb7a5f9/68747470733a2f2f64313273776274773731397934732e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f696d616765732f76365270785734302f615030714b4c6a6b50694175585a6859754234352f774441554c417a4679782e6a7065673f773d353438\n    :align: center\n    :width: 300\n    :target: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nClick the image or visit: https://sellfy.com/p/um2fkx/\n\nHardware requirements\n\n- 2 Gigabytes of RAM (1 Gigabyte if OCR is turned off).\n- Multiple core CPU (64 bit, faster than 1 GHz recommended).\n\n\nImportant links\n\n- `Homepage <http://www.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Documentation <https://docs.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Contributing <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__\n- `Forum <https://forum.mayan-edms.com>`__\n- `Source code, issues, bugs <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms>`__\n- `Plug-ins, other related projects <https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Translations <https://www.transifex.com/rosarior/mayan-edms/>`__\n- `Videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJOOXHP1MJ9lVA7d8ZTlHPw>`__\n\n\n.. |donation| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/donation-PayPal-brightgreen\n   :target: https://paypal.me/MayanEDMS\n.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/mayan-edms/\n.. |builds| image:: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/badges/master/build.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/pipelines\n.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mayan-edms.svg\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mayan-edms.svg?style=flat\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/blob/master/LICENSE\n.. |docker_pulls| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_stars| image:: https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://hub.docker.com/r/mayanedms/mayanedms/\n.. |docker_layers| image:: https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/mayanedms/mayanedms.svg\n   :target: https://microbadger.com/images/mayanedms/mayanedms\n.. |commit_activity| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/mayan-edms/mayan-edms.svg\n   :target: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/\n.. |support| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Get_support-brightgreen\n   :target: https://www.mayan-edms.com/support/\n.. |store| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Online_store-black\n   :target: https://teespring.com/stores/mayan-edms\n\n\n4.4.5 (2023-03-11)\n==================\n- Merge version 4.3.6 documents app migration 80 workaround.\n  Update migration 80 of the documents app to ensure the stored size of the\n  converted document file size does not exceed the ``PositiveIntegerField``\n  database field maximum value of 2147483647\n  (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#positiveintegerfield).\n- Merges from version 4.3.7:\n\n  - GitOps improvements.\n  - Move the helper module ``version.py`` to the dependencies app.\n  - Add OCI metadata annotations.\n\n4.4.4 (2023-02-14)\n==================\n- Update image interface when generating QRCode image. Fixes OTP QRCode\n  rendering. Thanks to forum user Ken Robinson (@DocCyblade) for the report.\n- Simplify OTP QRCode generation to lower the chances of future regressions.\n- Add a custom REST API exception handler to workaround inconsistent\n  validation exception behavior in Django REST framework\n  (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/2145). Closes\n  GitLab issue #1128. Thanks to Jan Przychodniak (@janprzychodniak) for the\n  report and debug information.\n- Ensure correct index instance nodes are deleted. Don't delete all excluded\n  index instances nodes. Instead delete all the index instance nodes where\n  the document being processed is found but exclude the nodes recently\n  updated. Closes GitLab issue #1134. Thanks to Nicholas Buttigieg\n  (@nicholasbuttigieg) and Kyle Pullicino (@KPull) for the report and test\n  scenario.\n- Remove the Python Transifex client. The new Go based client is required\n  to be installed manually when working with translations\n  (https://github.com/transifex/cli).\n\n4.4.3 (2023-02-11)\n==================\n- Improve transformation views to always pass the object\n  having the transformation applied.\n- Add support to the ``Link`` class for dynamic view keyword arguments, icon,\n  resolved object, and permissions.\n- Update the transformation, decorations, and redactions links to use\n  dynamic view keyword arguments, icons, resolved objects, and permissions.\n- Move transformation and redactions links to either their own ``links.py``\n  module. In the case of the ``documents`` app, the module is named\n  ``miscellaneous_links.py``.\n- Improve permissions handling of the transformation, decorations, and\n  redactions links.\n- Improve transformation and redaction link testing.\n- Sanitize tag labels to avoid XSS abuse (CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS).\n  This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be\n  used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to\n  or removal from a document.\n\n  It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or\n  expose arbitrary information with this weakness.\n\n  Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and\n  is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors\n  to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.\n\n  It is also being incorrectly reported that this weakness can be used to\n  steal the session cookie and impersonate users. Since version 1.4\n  (March 23, 2012) Django has included the ``httponly``\n  attribute for the session cookie. This means that the session cookie data,\n  including ``sessionid``, is no longer accessible from JavaScript.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/1.4/\n\n  Mayan EDMS currently uses Django 3.2. Under this version of Django\n  The ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` defaults to ``True``, which enables the\n  ``httponly`` for the session cookie making it inaccessible to JavaScript\n  and therefore not available for impersonation via session hijacking.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#session-cookie-httponly\n\n  Django's ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` setting is not currently exposed by\n  Mayan EDMS' setting system, therefore it is not possible to disable this\n  protection by conventional means.\n\n  Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making\n  it easy to track down any bad actors.\n\n  Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is\n  very limited, if any.\n\n  There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this\n  weakness to expose or destroy data.\n- Drop support for Python 3.7 and Python 3.8. Python 3.9 is now the minimum\n  version supported. This change happened in version 4.4 but was not\n  documented. Closes GitLab issue #1137. Thanks to joh-ku (@joh-ku)\n  for the report and research.\n\n4.4.2 (2023-01-23)\n==================\n- Merge request !106. Do not show server communication modal\n  for interrupted AJAX requests. Thanks to\n  Nicholas Buttigieg (@nicholasbuttigieg) and\n  Kyle Pullicino (@KPull) for the patch.\n\n4.4.1 (2023-01-19)\n==================\n- Fix list filtering template issue caused by caching.\n- GitOps updates:\n\n  - Add makefile targets to trigger standalone builds.\n  - Increase artifact expiration.\n  - Add PIP and APT caching to documentation and python build stages.\n  - Add GitLab CI job dependencies.\n  - Reuse Python build in stages.\n  - Convert branches into literals.\n  - Remove duplicated code in jobs.\n\n- Simplify installation documentation.\n\n4.4 (2023-01-16)\n================\n- Update Docker image tags:\n\n  - Docker from 20-dind to 20.10.21-dind\n  - ElasticSearch from 7.17.0 to 7.17.7\n  - PostgreSQL from 12.11-alpine to 13.11.2-alpine\n  - Redis from 6.2-alpine to 7.0.5-alpine\n\n- Update dependencies versions:\n\n  - Celery from 5.1.2 to 5.2.7.\n  - extract msg from 0.34.3 to 0.36.4.\n  - djangorestframework from 3.13.1 to 3.14.0.\n  - drf-yasg from 1.20.0 to 1.21.4.\n  - sentry-sdk from 1.5.8 to 1.21.1.\n  - Pillow from 9.2.0 to 9.4.0.\n\n- Increase compatibility of the file caching storage usage with more S3\n  object storage implementations.\n- Add support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. Adds the new\n  ``authentication_oidc`` app.\n- Add the parent cabinet as the action object to the cabinet creation event\n  when a child cabinet is created.\n- Add the cabinet deleted event. This event is committed when a child cabinet\n  is deleted. The parent cabinet is recorded as the action object for the\n  event.\n- Fix the function interfaces when calling ``get_mayan_object_permissions``\n  to ``get_mayan_view_permissions`` to override an API view permission\n  layout.\n- Update navigation permission check to short circuit check when the\n  current user has not logged in yet.\n- Cabinet updates:\n\n  - Use the same permission layout to create parent and child cabinets from\n    the API as from the HTTP views.\n  - The create permission is now required to create parent as well as child\n    cabinets. This change replaces requiring the edit permission to create\n    child cabinets via the HTTP views.\n\n- Data from file and download content creation or examination now defaults\n  to byte format instead of unicode.\n- Include Django Storages and boto3 Python libraries by default.\n- Use the optimized version (``+=``) of the ``+`` operator.\n- Moved the document version export code to its own app called\n  ``document_exports``. Existing export events and permissions are\n  migrated automatically.\n- Improved invalid permission error handling. Instead of returning an error\n  that stop execution when an invalid permission identifier is requested,\n  the permission model will return a one line text indicating that the\n  permission name is invalid. This error message will be displayed in place\n  of the intended permission label.\n\n  This behavior was also extended to cover invalid permission\n  namespace requests.\n\n  A troubleshooting section is added explaining the possible\n  reasons for the and the solution.\n- Search refactor:\n\n  - Added search syntax pre processor and convert all backend to work with\n    it.\n  - Simplify scoped search syntax.\n  - Allow more than two operands per operator.\n  - Implement NOT operator.\n  - Improve AND and OR operators.\n  - Split search classes into separate modules.\n  - Add search field subclasses.\n  - Move instance value retrieval to search fields.\n  - Add virtual fields.\n  - Add an \"ANY field\" virtual field.\n  - All search is now conducted using an internal scope system.\n  - Move search syntax decoding to its own class and subclasses named\n    ``SearchInterpreter``.\n  - Move the search bar to the main menu top bar.\n  - Add support for data typing.\n  - Normalize data during index and search.\n\n- Testing improvement. Track test document IDs. Keep a list of the test\n  document IDs in number and string format.\n- New reusable view mixin, ``MultipleExternalObjectViewMixin``.\n- Add Hebrew to the default list of document languages.\n- Enable Docker BuildKit.\n- Add dedicated Docker build RUN cache.\n- Docker Compose file changes:\n\n  - Configurable frontend HTTP port via the .env file.\n  - Unify frontend and all_in_one profiles HTTP and Traefik configuration.\n  - Support Let's Entry TLS termination for all_in_one profile.\n  - Configurable RabbitMQ administration HTTP port via the .env file.\n  - Configurable Traefik dashboard, HTTP and HTTPS entrypoints ports via\n    the .env file.\n  - Configurable Traefik Let's Encrypt certificate volume location.\n  - Support Let's Encrypt DNS challenge.\n\n- Isolate compressed file MIME type matchin exception catching to the\n  pertinent code.\n- Download file updates:\n\n  - Associate download files to a specific users.\n  - Add delete, download, and view permissions.\n  - Add download file size column.\n\n- Support bulk document file downloads.\n- Move document file download code to the new document downloads app. Migrate\n  existing document file download permission and events.\n\n- Permission updates:\n\n  - Improve permission caching. Remove custom caching code and\n    use upstream Django caching utilities.\n  - Rename variables for clarity.\n  - Update dependent code to match class interface changes.\n\n- Short circuit the source column source object resolution code to support\n  the list template showing columns even on empty lists. Unlike models and\n  queryset, empty lists of class instances won't display any columns.\n- Download GPG keys in binary mode.\n- Show more details when a bootstrap setting parsing error occurs.\n- Add libfuse2, libsasl2-dev, and libldap2-dev to the development setup\n  makefile target.\n- Convert pagination template into a partial.\n- Add .msg file metadata drivers.\n- Convert the metadata value and the file metadata value fields from\n  character fields with a maximum length of 255 characters to text fields.\n- Improve the settings apps navigation.\n- Collapse action menus by default.\n- Split links in the list items template into action links and view (facet)\n  links.\n- Remove Docker mirror configuration from the GitLab CI file. This is up to\n  the runner to configure.\n- Show cache partitions and partition file totals. This helps determine how\n  effective is a cache maximum size value by showing how many objects and\n  files the cache size limit is able to yield.\n- Statistics updates:\n\n  - Improve statistics navigation.\n  - Add doughnut chart type statistic.\n  - Add pie chart type statistic.\n  - Add column displaying the chart type per statistic.\n  - Update chartjs from version 2.8.0 to 3.9.1.\n  - Unify chart templates.\n  - Autoload statistics modules.\n  - Unify ChartJS templates.\n  - Support passing full chart context not just plot data.\n  - Fix app URL layout.\n  - Fix app URL typo.\n  - Fix statistic queue view navigation context.\n\n- Add three document pie chart statistics: document count per document type,\n  document file count per document type, document file page count per\n  document type.\n- Add documentation directives to insert setting or setting namespace\n  instances.\n- Improve search and object storage documentation by adding automated\n  setting references.\n- Add third state to column sorting. The sorting states are now: ascending,\n  descending, none.\n- Support sorting multiple columns.\n- Add a permission count column to ACLs.\n- Add support for setting choices.\n- Add an HTML to better format setting values.\n- Fix search again view redirect. Retain the query from the previous view.\n- Rename the \"Search\" facet link to \"Basic search\".\n- Fix \"Match All\" behavior when using the \"Search again\" link.\n- Replace \"Match All\" field with a radio box to allow supporting search\n  again persistence and also the default state of the field.\n- Convert the \"Match All\" field name into a literal.\n- Split the document file creation method into smaller units. This reduces\n  the complexity of the several conditional statements.\n- Ensure the document file is created even if there are errors during the\n  uploaded file introspection.\n- Encapsulate mozilla-django-oidc settings as Mayan authentication backend\n  arguments.\n- Add support for OpenID Connect Discovery (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).\n- Add Keycloak Docker Compose service.\n- Make Docker Compose service image name configurable.\n- User interface updates:\n\n  - Collapse views and actions by default.\n  - Add collapsed views and actions icons.\n  - Move views and actions markup to their own respective partial templates.\n    This reduces duplication and improves usability of the markup.\n  - Lower the z-index of the sidebar to avoid menus to display behind it.\n  - Add simulated horizontal rulers to the body of tables.\n  - Support slim dropdown menus.\n  - Move navigation to the card footer.\n  - Fix click events passing through views and action dropdown caret icons.\n  - Make the words \"Actions\" and \"Views\" translatable.\n  - Add two new table columns. One columns for views and another the actions.\n  - Unroll single action menus to a button.\n  - Reduce table padding to increase data area.\n  - Minor spacing and margin tweaks.\n\n- Code style refactor and cleanup:\n\n  - Strip trailing commas.\n  - Sort arguments, dictionary keys and class methods.\n  - Unroll nested contexts.\n  - Separate model data and business logic code.\n  - Move add or remove code to models. Directly and as added methods to\n    external models.\n  - Pass the user to action methods instead of injecting the user as the\n    event actor. Injecting the user as the event actor will be done only\n    on immediate methods that do not allow arguments or data layer model\n    methods with well defined upstream arguments.\n  - Add keyword arguments.\n  - Rename mixins modules to be more explicit.\n  - Normalize the ``UploadWizard`` class ``step_post_upload_process`` method\n    arguments.\n  - Remove many instances of ``force_text``.\n  - Move several ``upload_to`` functions to their corresponding app's\n    ``utils`` module.\n  - Promote private ``_user`` argument to an official argument.\n\n- API views refactor:\n\n  - Remove injected objects on API views. Each API view needs to query the\n    object explicitly. This is change is less efficient but was made to\n    mirror how upstream DRF works.\n  - Pass the view object to the action object API view.\n  - Add labels to serializer fields.\n\n- Track the user when purging caches and cache partitions.\n- Create a new permission to change the type of a document.\n  When support for changing the type of a document was added, it was\n  considered a property and controlled via the document property edit\n  permission.\n\n  Since changing the type of a documents now causes a cascade of other\n  changes, it was isolated as an individual class of event along\n  with its own permission.\n\n  The new document change type permission is required for the document being\n  changed and for the document type to which the document will be changed\n  into.\n- Update the file metadata model ``verbose_name`` attribute to be the\n  ``help_text`` attribute.\n- Update the document parsing ``verbose_name`` attribute to be the\n  ``help_text`` attribute.\n- Update the document version OCR ``verbose_name`` attribute to be the\n  ``help_text`` attribute.\n- Update the search API to provide a dummy model serializer during Swagger\n  introspection.\n- Update the sources actions API to provide a dummy serializer during Swagger\n  introspection.\n- Fix Swagger schema model definition introspection. Updated REST API views\n  to behave like user interface views and returning querysets either via\n  the ``source_queryset`` property or the ``get_source_queryset`` method.\n  This prevents API views from overriding the queryset return methods and\n  allows the ``SchemaInspectionAPIViewMixin`` mixin to work in all\n  instances.\n- Add support for platform client backends to register tool links.\n- Lower the default Sentry client sample rate from 0.05 to 0.01.\n- Add new setting to disable automatic upload after dragging files to the\n  DropZone widget. The setting is named ``VIEWS_SHOW_DROPZONE_SUBMIT_BUTTON``\n  and defaults to ``False``.\n- Raise an ``ImproperlyConfigured`` exception when a model is registered for\n  error logging more than once.\n- Move error logging registration of document models to the documents app.\n- OCR updates:\n\n  - Move error logging from the document version to the document version\n    page.\n  - Add OCR backend ``_execute`` to avoid subclasses from calling the super\n    class.\n  - The base class now prepares the image to be processed and passes the\n    file object to the subclass.\n  - Move OCR finished event commit from the task to the manager.\n\n- Restore object event attributes when the event is ignored.\n- Error log registration now register error log permissions too by default.\n- Improve base settings initialization:\n\n  - Replace ``os.path`` with ``pathlib.Path`` to do path manipulation.\n  - Use the default secret key value only if the secret key file is not\n    found.\n  - Don't obscure errors when reading the secret key file.\n\n- Remove the ``home_view`` setting from the default Template context.\n  Template instances need to include their own context using the new\n  ``context`` argument.\n- Add templating support to bootstrap settings. Template names are the same\n  as the bootstrap setting but include the ``SETTING_TEMPLATE_`` prefix.\n  Environment variables, Python global and config file values are available\n  to the template.\n- Remove deprecated management commands:\n\n  - ``checkdependencies`` replaced by ``dependencies_check``.\n  - ``checkversion`` replaced by ``dependencies_check_version``.\n  - ``createautoadmin`` replaced by ``autoadmin_create``.\n  - ``generaterequirements`` replaced by ``dependencies_generate_requirements``.\n  - ``initialsetup`` replaced by ``common_initial_setup``.\n  - ``installdependencies`` replaced by ``dependencies_install``.\n  - ``mountindex`` replaced by ``mirroring_mount_index``.\n  - ``performupgrade`` replaced by ``common_perform_upgrade``.\n  - ``platformtemplate`` replaced by ``platform_template``.\n  - ``preparestatic`` replaced by ``appearance_prepare_static``.\n  - ``purgelocks`` replaced by ``lock_manager_purge_locks``.\n  - ``purgepermissions`` replaced by ``permissions_purge``.\n  - ``purgeperiodictasks`` replaced by ``task_manager_purge_periodic_tasks``.\n  - ``purgestatistics`` replaced by ``statistics_purge``.\n  - ``revertsettings`` replaced by ``settings_revert``.\n  - ``savesettings`` replaced by ``settings_save``.\n  - ``showsettings`` replaced by ``settings_show``.\n  - ``showversion`` replaced by ``dependencies_show_version``.\n\n- Update the makefile to enable the Sentry client if the ``SENTRY_DSN``\n  value is passed to the ``runserver``, ``runserver-plus``, or\n  ``staging-frontend`` targets.\n- Add new setting to disable logging message ANSI color codes. The setting\n  is named ``LOGGING_DISABLE_COLOR_FORMATTER`` and defaults to ``False``.\n- Standardize management command testing.\n- Move management command names to the ``literals`` module of each app.\n- GitOps updates:\n\n  - Add configurable remote branch for GitOps.\n  - Support a local environment config file names ``config-local.env``.\n    This file is ignored by Git and meant to override values of ``config.env``.\n\n4.3.7 (2023-09-10)\n==================\n- Merge changes from version 4.2.14:\n\n  - GitOps improvements.\n  - Support a local environment config file names ``config-local.env``.\n  - Split GitLab CI targets into their own makefile.\n  - Move the helper module ``version.py`` to the dependencies app.\n  - Convert branches into literals.\n  - Add OCI metadata annotations\n\n- OCI metadata change. Don't remove the 'T' from the image date label.\n\n4.3.6 (2023-02-19)\n==================\n- Update migration 80 of the documents app to ensure the stored size of the\n  converted document file size does not exceed the ``PositiveIntegerField``\n  database field maximum value of 2147483647\n  (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#positiveintegerfield).\n- Sanitize tag labels to avoid XSS abuse (CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS).\n  This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be\n  used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to\n  or removal from a document.\n\n  It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or\n  expose arbitrary information with this weakness.\n\n  Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and\n  is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account.

Closes\n  GitLab issue #1128. Thanks to Jan Przychodniak (@janprzychodniak) for the\n  report and debug information.\n\n4.3.5 (2023-01-10)\n==================\n- Fix error when deleting a user form the user interface.

Thanks to friki67 (@friki67) for the report and\n  Jan Przychodniak (@janprzychodniak) for the additional debug information.\n\n4.3.4 (2022-12-19)\n==================\n- Merge fixes from version 4.2.13.\n- Fix reference to ``ocr_errors`` in\n  ``mayan.apps.ocr.tasks.task_document_version_ocr_finished``. Closes GitLab\n  issue #1131. Thanks to  Olivier D. (@odelseth) for the report and debug\n  information.\n- Fix click events passing through views and action dropdown caret icons.\n  Activating the dropdown menu by clicking on the menu's caret no longer\n  select the document file or version card.\n\n4.3.3 (2022-11-15)\n==================\n- Fixes from version 4.2.12.\n- Add a patch for Python's CVE-2007-4559\n  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559).\n\n  This is a language level vulnerability which exposed older versions\n  of Mayan EDMS only when downloading JavaScript dependencies from the NPM\n  registry.\n\n  Exploiting this vulnerability requires compromising an existing package\n  hosted on the NPM registry and adding Python code specifically targeting\n  Mayan EDMS. As part of the project's design philosophies, dependencies\n  are only downloaded from authoritative locations and each dependency is\n  pinned to a specific version to guarantee immutable releases.\n\n  Due to all these factors, surface of attack of this vulnerability is\n  very limited for older versions of Mayan EDMS, it is also very improbable,\n  very difficulty to accomplish and very difficult to remain undetected.\n\n  There are no known actual or theoretical attacks for Mayan EDMS\n  exploiting this vulnerability.\n\n  Thanks to the TrellixVulnTeam for the pull request which lead to this\n  Mayan EDMS specific patch.\n\n4.3.2 (2022-11-12)\n==================\n- Use the correct icon for the document type file metadata\n  setup link.\n- Merge bugfix version 4.2.11 and 4.2.12.\n- Update translation files.\n- Fix response structure of the search model API view.\n  Ensure the search fields are displayed.\n- Fix hardcoded list mode argument.\n\n4.3.1 (2022-08-21)\n==================\n- Fixes and improvements merged from version 4.2.9 and 4.2.10.\n- Fix the function interfaces when calling ``get_mayan_object_permissions``\n  to ``get_mayan_view_permissions`` to override an API view permission\n  layout.\n\n4.3 (2022-07-27)\n================\n- Partials navigation updates:\n\n  - Streamline JavaScript partials navigation code.\n  - Make the AJAX response redirect code configurable. New setting\n    ``APPEARANCE_AJAX_REDIRECTION_CODE`` added.\n  - Remove repeated AJAX redirection middleware.\n\n- Add white outline to favicon.\n- Add support for optional ``get_mayan_object_permissions`` and\n  ``get_mayan_view_permissions`` methods to allow API views to customize\n  how required permissions are calculated.\n- Added support for form fieldsets.\n- Added fieldsets to the following forms:\n\n    - document file properties\n    - document type deletion policies\n    - metadata type\n    - user\n\n- Remove usage of flat ``values_list`` queryset in metadata managers module.\n- Prefix all test objects with an underscore to avoid clashes with test\n  methods.\n- ``PartialNavigation.js`` improvements.\n\n  - Clean URL query on form submit and use form data as the URL query.\n  - Remove dead code.\n  - Use constants where appropriate.\n\n- Search updates:\n\n  - Add filtering support to list views. All list view that show instances of\n    models with a corresponding defined search model, will show a text box\n    for filtering the list. The syntax is the same as the standard simple\n    search.\n  - Empty list views now show the toolbar for cases where the list is empty\n    due to a filtering term.\n  - Define the ``q`` URL query key as an internal literal named\n    ``QUERY_PARAMETER_ANY_FIELD``.\n\n- Support AJAX request cancellation. This avoid the user interface from\n  appearing to unresponsive when the backend is overloaded.\n- Support AJAX request throttling. Prevents users from requesting too many\n  consecutive page loads. Defaults to a maximum of 10 requests in 5 seconds\n  of less. This applies only to the user interface. The AJAX throttling\n  resets when a pending request is completed. Added the settings\n  ``APPEARANCE_THROTTLING_MAXIMUM_REQUESTS`` and\n  ``APPEARANCE_THROTTLING_TIMEOUT``. Display a message notifying users when\n  throttling is in effect.\n- ``BaseBackend`` class improvements.\n\n  - Selectable identifier via the ``_backend_identifier`` property. Defaults\n    to ``backend_class_path`` for compatibility.\n  - Update ``.get_all`` to return a list and not a dictionary.\n  - Add property ``backend_id`` that returns the value of the class\n    ``_backend_identifier`` property.\n\n- Convert document file actions from hardcoded logic to an extensible class\n  using the ``BaseBackend`` class. Available classes will be loaded from the\n  ``document_file_actions`` module. The id of the class defaults to the\n  existing literal values for compatibility.\n- Add API endpoint called ``document_file_actions`` to list the available\n  actions and their properties. API endpoint URL: /api/v4/document_file_actions/\n- Add document version modification backend. Convert the document version\n  page reset and append functions into document version modication backends.\n  Update document version views and API endpoints to use document version\n  modification backends.\n  Adds new API endpoints:\n\n    - /api/v4/documents/{ ID }/versions/{ ID }/modify/\n    - /api/v4/document_version_modification_backends/\n\n- Add workflow action to send user messages.\n- Update ``WorkflowAction`` to use ``common.classes.BaseBackend``.\n- Pagination refactor:\n\n  - Remove ``django-pure-pagination`` package.\n  - Use Django's 3.2 new ``get_proper_elided_page_range`` for paging.\n  - Remove duplicate URL query string manipulation.\n  - Remove duplicated pagination template.\n  - Make pagination argument configurable. Added the setting\n    ``VIEWS_PAGING_ARGUMENT``. Defaults to ``page`` for compatibility.\n\n- Update the default pagination size from 40 items to 30.\n- Support hyphenated text when using the ElasticSearch backend.\n- Add support for supplying files to source backend via the API. Add the\n  ``accept_files`` property to ``SourceBackendAction`` which dynamically add\n  a ``file`` serializer field for the corresponding action.\n- Add an ``upload`` action to the web form source. This allows using web form\n  sources to upload documents from the API.\n- Support REST API list filtering. Filtering is done using similar logic\n  to that of the user interface list filtering. However, the API list\n  filtering also support filtering by any field and not just using the\n  special \"any field\" ``q`` query key.\n- Merge fixes from version 4.2.2.\n- Move the ``purgeperiodictasks`` command from the common app to the\n  task_manager app.\n- Drop support for Python 3.6.\n- Dependencies update:\n\n  - ElasticSearch from 7.16.0 to 7.17.0.\n  - Debian from 11.2-slim to 11.3-slim.\n  - PostgreSQL from 12.9-alpine to 12.10-alpine.\n  - RabbitMQ from 3.9-alpine to 3.10-alpine.\n  - amqp from 5.0.9 to 5.1.0.\n  - pip from 21.3.1 to 22.2.\n  - psycopg2 from 2.9.2 to 2.9.3.\n  - redis from 4.0.2 to 4.2.0.\n  - FontAwesome from 5.6.3 to 5.15.4.\n  - urijs from 1.19.7 to 1.19.10.\n  - bleach from 4.0.0 to 4.1.0.\n  - django-solo from 1.1.5 to 2.0.0.\n  - jstree from 3.3.11 to 3.3.12.\n  - PyYAML from 5.4.1 to 6.0.\n  - django-model-utils from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.\n  - django-mptt from 0.12.0 to 0.13.4.\n  - pycountry from 20.7.3 to 22.3.5.\n  - requests from 2.26.0 to 2.27.0.\n  - devpi-server from 6.2.0 to 6.5.0.\n  - django-debug-toolbar from 3.2.2 to 3.2.4.\n  - django-extensions from 3.1.3 to 3.1.5.\n  - django-rosetta from 0.9.7 to 0.9.8.\n  - django-silk from 4.1.0 to 4.3.0.\n  - flake8 from 3.9.2 to 4.0.1.\n  - ipython from 7.26.0 to 7.32.0.\n  - transifex-client from 0.14.3 to 0.14.4.\n  - twine from 3.4.2 to 3.8.0.\n  - wheel from 0.37.0 to 0.37.1.\n  - Pillow from 8.3.1 to 9.2.0.\n  - node-semver from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1.\n  - packaging from 21.0 to 21.3.\n  - python_gnupg from 0.4.7 to 0.4.8.\n  - elasticsearch from 7.16.0 to 7.17.1.\n  - django-activity-stream from 0.10.0 to 1.4.0.\n  - chart.js from 2.7.3 to 2.8.0.\n  - python-magic from 0.4.24 to 0.4.26.\n  - gevent from 21.8.0 to 21.12.0.\n  - sentry-sdk from 1.4.1 to 1.5.8.\n  - whitenoise from 5.3.0 to 6.0.0.\n  - cropperjs from 1.5.2 to 1.5.12.\n  - django-cors-headers from 3.8.0 to 3.10.0.\n  - djangorestframework from 3.12.4 to 3.13.1.\n  - jsonschema from 3.2.0 to 4.4.0.\n  - swagger-spec-validator from 2.7.3 to 2.7.4.\n  - dropzone from 5.9.2 to 5.9.3.\n  - pycryptodome from 3.10.1 to 3.10.4.\n  - celery from 5.1.2 to 5.2.3.\n  - django-formtools from 2.2 to 2.3.\n  - django-widget-tweaks from 1.4.9 to 1.4.12.\n  - furl from 2.1.2 to 2.1.3.\n  - Sphinx from 3.5.4 to 4.5.0.\n\n- Silence warning about unordered object pagination for:\n\n  - Announcements\n  - Document index instance nodes\n  - Workflow transition triggers\n  - File caches\n  - Quotas\n\n- Convert API search model names to lowercase to revert backward incompatible\n  change in version 4.2. Search model names via the API can now be specified\n  in either lowercase (version 4.2) or hybrid case (version <4.2).\n- ``mkdtemp`` now accepts a ``dir`` argument like the upstream version.\n  However the ``dir`` value is appended to the system wide value of\n  ``STORAGE_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY``.\n- Staging folder updates:\n\n  - Support inclusion regular expression.\n  - Support exclusion regular expression.\n  - Support subfolders.\n  - Update scan code to use ``pathlib.Path``.\n  - Support pagination.\n\n- Add support for workflow escalation. This feature allows moving a workflow\n  forward after the workflow has remained in a certain state after a\n  pre-determined amount of time. Multiple escalations are supported for\n  each state. Conditions using the templating language are supported.\n- Move model based classes to the databases app. Move the classes:\n\n  - ``ModelQueryFields``\n  - ``ModelAttribute``\n  - ``ModelProperty``\n  - ``ModelField``\n  - ``ModelFieldRelated``\n  - ``ModelReverseField``\n  - ``QuerysetParametersSerializer``\n\n- Convert the OCR app to the new error log system. The permission\n  \"View error log\" is now required to view the document version OCR error\n  log.\n- Convert the document parsing app to the new error log system. The\n  permission \"View error log\" is now required to view the document file\n  parsing error log.\n- Remove the Python package ``mock``. This package is now available as\n  unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onward.\n- Unify and remove repeated workflow API views code using parent resolution\n  mixins.\n- Support adding help text to search model fields. By default the help text\n  from the model fields will be used.\n- Increase the document type label size from 96 characters to 196.\n- Update the document type label field help text.\n- Search updates:\n\n  - Rename search model instances from \"...search\" to \"search_model...\".\n  - Add support for removing search fields from third party apps. The method\n    is called ``.remove_search_field(search_field=)`` and requires the\n    search field instance obtained from the method ``.get_search_fields()``.\n  - Remove the ``search_fields`` list and use the ``search_fields_dict``\n    instead for both purposes. The canonical method to obtain the search\n    field of a search model is now using the method ``.get_search_fields()``.\n\n- Update the ElasticSearch backend default settings to match those of the\n  official Python client.\n- Don't introspect document file MIME type at download. Instead pass the\n  stored values.\n- Support empty ranges for ``parse_range``.\n- Add ``group_iterator`` to group iterators in to lists of tuples.\n- Refactor bulk object search indexing:\n\n  - Rename ``mayan.apps.dynamic_search.tasks.task_index_search_model`` to\n    ``mayan.apps.dynamic_search.tasks.task_index_instances``.\n  - Index only objects that exists instead of using blind ranges.\n  - Update ``search_index_objects`` management command to trigger multiple\n    ``task_index_instances`` tasks instead of just one.\n\n- Add date manipulation template tags. The new tags are ``date_parse`` to\n  convert a string into a datetime object and ``timedelta`` to apply time\n  transformations to a datetime object.\n- Add a ``size`` field to the document file model. Since this value is not\n  expected to change, it is now a persistent model field and not calculated\n  on demand by querying the storage layer. This change also improves document\n  mirroring performance by removing one disk access per document and using\n  the database stored size value which is immutable.\n- Support searching messages. Make the ``subject``, ``body``, ``date_time``\n  fields searchable.\n- Error logging updates:\n\n  - Add error log entry delete permission.\n  - Add support deleting individual error log entries or the complete error\n    log of an object.\n  - Add the error log entry delete event.\n  - Support subscribing to the error log entry delete event of an object.\n  - Add API views. Support added to view the error log of objects.\n\n- Migrations code style cleanup.\n\n  - Rename code migrations functions prefix from ``operation_`` to ``code_``.\n  - Add keyword arguments.\n  - PEP8 code style cleanups.\n\n- Add support for cabinet mirroring.\n- Remove ``django-colorful``. Use HTML5 color field instead.\n- Add support to randomize the tag color.\n- Document parsing updates. Closes GitLab issue #957. Thanks to\n  LeVon Smoker (@lsmoker) for the report and initial suggestions.\n\n  - Pass the original document file to parsers instead of attempting to\n    pre-processing the document file to PDF.\n  - Add parsing support for office document files and text files.\n\n- Rename test file literals for uniformity.\n- Rename management commands to include the app name where they are defined.\n  Add a stub command for backwards compatibility.\n\n  - ``checkdependencies`` replaced by ``dependencies_check``.\n  - ``checkversion`` replaced by ``dependencies_check_version``.\n  - ``createautoadmin`` replaced by ``autoadmin_create``.\n  - ``generaterequirements`` replaced by ``dependencies_generate_requirements``.\n  - ``initialsetup`` replaced by ``common_initial_setup``.\n  - ``installdependencies`` replaced by ``dependencies_install``.\n  - ``mountindex`` replaced by ``mirroring_mount_index``.\n  - ``performupgrade`` replaced by ``common_perform_upgrade``.\n  - ``platformtemplate`` replaced by ``platform_template``.\n  - ``preparestatic`` replaced by ``appearance_prepare_static``.\n  - ``purgelocks`` replaced by ``lock_manager_purge_locks``.\n  - ``purgepermissions`` replaced by ``permissions_purge``.\n  - ``purgeperiodictasks`` replaced by ``task_manager_purge_periodic_tasks``.\n  - ``purgestatistics`` replaced by ``statistics_purge``.\n  - ``revertsettings`` replaced by ``settings_revert``.\n  - ``savesettings`` replaced by ``settings_save``.\n  - ``showsettings`` replaced by ``settings_show``.\n  - ``showversion`` replaced by ``dependencies_show_version``.\n\n- Split the document indexing models module. Module is split into index\n  template and instance models.\n- Show item count even if the list is empty. This change prevents the list\n  toolbar from \"jumping\" visually when there are no results.\n- Simplify how the view title is copied to the window title. Escaping is now\n  performed by jQuery.\n- Add icons to all views. Every view now has a corresponding icon to be\n  displayed with the title.\n- Normalize icon, link and view names. Follow the pattern\n  object_sub_object_action.\n- Add warning message when user attempting to delete their own accounts.\n- Add support for Whoosh bulk indexing using the ``BufferedWriter`` class.\n  When reindexing the search indexes, for every lock obtained, a group of\n  object will be written as a single operation. The number of objects\n  written concurrently is controlled by the settings\n  ``SEARCH_INDEXING_CHUNK_SIZE``.\n- Split converter app views into separate modules.\n- Add support for transformation argument forms.\n- Improve transformation argument column display.\n- Fix argument handling for the transformation\n  ``TransformationDrawRectangle``.\n- Check and reject negative percent values for the zoom transformation.\n- Fix asset transformations hash calculation.\n- Use a lower layer that the redaction layer to allow seeing the entire\n  document when editing redactions. This is more natural as it gives the\n  impression the redaction is actually being edited by being moved instead\n  of showing two redactions (old in the image plus the interactive one).\n- Add transparency support to the ``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent``\n  transformation.\n- Unify the ``TransformationDrawRectangle`` and\n  ``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent`` transformations.\n- Move transformation mixins to their own module.\n- Allow classes using ``APIImageViewMixin`` to specify the stream MIME type\n  via ``get_stream_mime_type``.\n- Fix repeated model manager definition in the ``DocumentFilePage`` model.\n- Support easier test document stub creation via the new\n  ``auto_create_test_document_stub``. It is mutually exclusive with\n  ``auto_create_test_document_stub`` and requires settings\n  ``auto_upload_test_document`` to False.\n- Add first name and last name fields to the test case user.\n- Generalize image transformations into reusable mixins:\n  ``ImagePasteCoordinatesAbsoluteTransformationMixin``,\n  ``ImagePasteCoordinatesPercentTransformationMixin``,\n  ``ImageWatermarkPercentTransformationMixin``.\n- Add support for signature capture. The signature capture app allows\n  capture of handwritten signatures. The original point data as well as\n  an SVG version of the signature is store. The point data represents the\n  raw signature primitives that allows reloading them into the signature\n  pad library. The SVG version allows for rendering as an image for preview.\n  A transformation is added to allow pasting a signature as a page image.\n- Remove trailing new lines from the MIME type and encoding returned by the\n  ``MIMETypeBackendFileCommand``.\n- Make ``MIMETypeBackendFileCommand`` the default MIME backend.\n- Fix sorting and grouping of permissions in the workflow action to grant\n  or revoke document access.\n- Remove ``SearchModel`` unused class method and improve result sorting.\n- Navigation updates:\n\n  - Add support for extra HTML attributes.\n  - Improve HTML data by allowing the entries to be resolved against the\n    context.\n  - Support empty URL values. When empty, the link is rendered without a\n    href attribute.\n\n- Add link to make staging folder file selection easier. Closes GitLab\n  issue #341. Thanks to Leroy Förster (@gersilex) for the report and\n  initial idea.\n- Modernize Python syntax:\n\n  - Pass generators instead of lists to ``sorted``.\n  - Update string formatting to use ``.format``.\n  - Remove creating of sets using the set factory and use instead the set\n    literal.\n\n- New workflow events: ``workflow instance created`` committed when a new\n  workflow is launched for a document and\n  ``workflow instance transitioned`` committed when a workflow instance is\n  transitioned to a new state, either manually or automatically.\n- Track the user when a new workflow instance is created or transitioned.\n- Optimize the document indexing by reusing the index instance node if it\n  already exists.\n- Add support for document index event triggers. Historically document\n  indexes used hard coded signals to trigger an index update. The indexing\n  app was updated to now use events to trigger these updates. This has the\n  additional benefits of allowing runtime configuration of the index event\n  triggers, disabling the ones not relevant for an index to improve\n  performance. New document indexes default to update on all available\n  document events. Existing indexes will me automatically migrated and\n  updated to update on all available document events. Index updates now\n  support more events like adding or removal from cabinets.\n  Closes GitLab issue #631. Thanks to Tobias Huhn (@twhuhn) for the request.\n- Convert the staging folder file selection input to a Select2 widget\n  supporting text filtering.\n- Move the transformations ``TransformationDrawRectangle`` and\n  ``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent`` to the decorations layer.\n- Add retry backoff maximum delay to the search tasks.\n- Add per user object event subscription view.\n- Add support for permission filtering to the notification views. This moves\n  the access filtering of notification from the class to the view. The\n  advantage of this change is that notifications are restricted when the\n  access control is modified, even if the notification already exists.\n- Normalize how the search \"Match all\" parameter is evaluated.\n- Fix evaluation of \"Match all\" when using a single level scoped search.\n- Discard non supported images contained in MPO images files.\n- Use the ElasticSearch count API (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat-count.html)\n  to obtain accurate search model status information.\n- Delete existing indexes when calling the ElasticSearch backend initialize\n  method.\n- Wrap search backend errors into a general exception with a short\n  explanation.\n- Documentation updates:\n\n  - Set the Docker Compose installation method as the main method.\n  - Add warning notes for the deprecated installation methods.\n  - Expand the requirements section.\n  - Move the requirements to their on chapter.\n  - Update the features part.\n\n- Add management command ``common_generate_random_secret_key`` to provide\n  random values suitable for use as ``SECRET_KEY``.\n- Refactor initial setup and upgrade commands:\n\n  - Consolidate management command code.\n  - Move command code to a separate class.\n  - Convert code to use pathlib.\n\n- Add support for disabling use of the media folder. Add the bootstrap\n  setting ``COMMON_DISABLE_LOCAL_STORAGE`` to disable use of the local\n  ``media`` folder. When using this setting, all apps must be also configured\n  via their respective storage backend settings to use alternate persistence\n  methods.\n- When serving images using ``APIImageViewMixin``, detect the MIME type of\n  the data before sending the stream. This ensures the image will load\n  correctly in all browsers that require a MIME type value in the header of\n  the stream.\n- Change the ``UUID`` field to ElasticSearch field mapping, from ``Keyword``\n  to ``Text`` to avoid search indexing error when processing document\n  containers with more than 910 documents. ElasticSearch's ``Keyword`` field\n  is limited to 32766 bytes and attempting to index a container with more\n  than 910 documents would exceed this limit.\n- Update the ElasticSearch backend search query configuration to be more\n  strict and lower the number of hits matched. Change the ``match`` query to\n  ``match_phrase`` and remove the ``fuzzy`` query.\n- Ensure document version pages point to an existing content object when\n  exporting. Otherwise they are skipped.\n- Improve document version export code to skip invalid pages. The page loop\n  will skip pages with no content object and regard the first page found\n  with a content object as the first exported page.\n- Don't assume all storages have a preset mode attribute. Such is the case\n  with the ``S3Boto3Storage`` when used for shared uploaded files. Instead\n  introspect the mode and fallback to a safe default valur of ``'rb'``.\n- Disable the settings edit link when local storage is disabled.\n- Display a warning message in the setting edit view when local storage is\n  disabled.\n\n4.2.14 (2023-03-09)\n===================\n- Merge changes from version 4.1.11:\n\n  - Removal of the Transifex Python client.\n  - Support a local environment config file names ``config-local.env``.\n  - Support multi `psycopg2` versions for testing. Upgrade testing now uses\n    ``PYTHON_PSYCOPG2_VERSION_PREVIOUS`` for the previous version when testing\n    against PostgreSQL.\n  - Move the helper module ``version.py`` to the dependencies app.\n\n- GitOps improvements and backports:\n\n  - Add configurable remote branch for GitOps.\n  - Add makefile targets to trigger standalone builds.\n  - Reuse Python build in stages.\n  - Convert branches into literals.\n  - Remove duplicated code in jobs.\n  - Split GitLab CI targets into their own makefile.\n  - Increase artifact expiration.\n  - Add PIP and APT caching to documentation and python build\n    stages.\n  - Add GitLab CI job dependencies.\n  - Enable Buildkit builds.\n  - Use APT proxy and cache in more places.\n  - Cache Alpine APK packages.\n  - Clean up cache directory definitions.\n  - Update APT cache to be at ``.cache/apt``.\n  - Add multi cache support.\n  - Add GitLab CI cache template tags.\n  - Update deployment stages.\n  - Don't push to the master branch on nightly or testing releases.\n  - Load config.env in all jobs.\n  - Move common SSH initialization to its own template tags.\n  - Convert YAML triple ''' quotes to a single quote.\n\n- Sanitize tag labels to avoid XSS abuse (CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS).\n  This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be\n  used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to\n  or removal from a document.\n\n  It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or\n  expose arbitrary information with this weakness.\n\n  Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and\n  is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors\n  to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.\n\n  It is also being incorrectly reported that this weakness can be used to\n  steal the session cookie and impersonate users. Since version 1.4\n  (March 23, 2012) Django has included the ``httponly``\n  attribute for the session cookie. This means that the session cookie data,\n  including ``sessionid``, is no longer accessible from JavaScript.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/1.4/\n\n  Mayan EDMS currently uses Django 3.2. Under this version of Django\n  The ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` defaults to ``True``, which enables the\n  ``httponly`` for the session cookie making it inaccessible to JavaScript\n  and therefore not available for impersonation via session hijacking.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#session-cookie-httponly\n\n  Django's ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` setting is not currently exposed by\n  Mayan EDMS' setting system, therefore it is not possible to disable this\n  protection by conventional means.\n\n  Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making\n  it easy to track down any bad actors.\n\n  Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is\n  very limited, if any.\n\n  There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this\n  weakness to expose or destroy data.\n- Add a custom REST API exception handler to workaround inconsistent\n  validation exception behavior in Django REST framework\n  (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/2145).\n\n4.2.13 (2022-12-18)\n===================\n- Fix document file and document version print form submit button.\n- Fix tagged document list view permission filtering. The permission\n  layout remains the same. Only the method in which the permissions is\n  checked was updated.\n- Fix metadata add action actor assignment. This assignment is not\n  currently used by either the view or the API which assign the actor\n  directly themselves.\n- Silence Docker Compose warning \"MAYAN_WORKER_CUSTOM_QUEUE_LIST variable\n  is not set\". Closes GitLab issue #1129. Thanks to GR Buck (@graybuck)\n  for the report.\n\n4.2.12 (2022-11-13)\n===================\n- Fixes from version 4.1.10.\n- Add a subclass of ``Path`` that adds the method ``is_relative_to`` for\n  Python versions lower than 3.9.\n- Add a patch for Python's CVE-2007-4559\n  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559).\n\n  This is a language level vulnerability which exposed older versions\n  of Mayan EDMS only when downloading JavaScript dependencies from the NPM\n  registry.\n\n  Exploiting this vulnerability requires compromising an existing package\n  hosted on the NPM registry and adding Python code specifically targeting\n  Mayan EDMS. As part of the project's design philosophies, dependencies\n  are only downloaded from authoritative locations and each dependency is\n  pinned to a specific version to guarantee immutable releases.\n\n  Due to all these factors surface of attack of this vulnerability is\n  very limited for older versions of Mayan EDMS, it is also very improbable,\n  very difficulty to accomplish and very difficult to remain undetected.\n\n  There are no known actual or theoretical attacks for Mayan EDMS\n  exploiting this vulnerability.\n\n  Thanks to the TrellixVulnTeam for the pull request which lead to this\n  Mayan EDMS specific patch.\n\n4.2.11 (2022-11-05)\n===================\n- Update Django from version 3.2.14 to 3.2.16.\n\n4.2.10 (2022-08-20)\n===================\n- Make file improvements. Don't require a local ``psql`` client to\n  launch the PostgreSQL development container. Don't require a local\n  Redis client to launch the Redis development container. Fix the\n  staging targets.\n- Display exception errors to console when Celery fails to initialize.\n- Use the ``DownloadFile`` filename attribute if available when performing\n  the actual download action. Fall back to the previous logic of the\n  string representation of the download file if the filename attribute\n  is not set.\n- Ensure cabinet document is added using the correct method when using the\n  upload wizard. Closes GitLab issue #1118. Thanks to\n  haithoum (@haithembenammar) for the report.\n- Improve cabinet, metadata, and tag app tests.\n- Ensure document tag is attached using the correct method when using the\n  upload wizard. Same issue to GitLab issue #1118. Thanks to\n  haithoum (@haithembenammar) for the initial report.\n\n4.2.9 (2022-08-04)\n==================\n- Add permission filtering to the source switch links. The permission\n  filtering will be the same as the views: document create permission for the\n  source links during document uploads and document file new permissions\n  for the source links in the new document file upload view.\n- Don't cache the impersonation and the settings app templates. This ensures\n  the impersonation banner and settings change banner are triggered\n  correctly in all edge cases where multiple frontend processes or load\n  balancers are used.\n- Add make file development targets ``setup-dev-operating-system-packages``\n  and ``setup-dev-python-libraries``.\n\n4.2.8 (2022-07-22)\n==================\n- Fix the permission requirement of the recently created documents dashboard\n  widget. The widget should filter by document view and not document type\n  view permission. Thanks to forum user LeVon Smoker (@lsmoker) for\n  the report.\n- Update Django from version 3.2.13 to 3.2.14.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/3.2.14/\n- Update Pillow from version 8.3.1 to 8.3.2.\n- Update cryptodome from version 3.10.1 to 3.10.4.\n- Remove the package ``firefox-geckdriver`` from the make file target\n  ``setup-dev-environment`` as it is no longer available in recent OS LTS\n  releases.\n- Update the GitLab CI file to support releasing testing build of the\n  Python library and the Docker image separately.\n- Update Docker Debian base image from debian:11.3-slim to to\n  debian:11.4-slim. https://www.debian.org/News/2022/20220709\n- Update PyPDF2 from version 1.26.0 to 1.28.4.

This allows accessing the page\n  to fix the transformation error. Closes GitLab issue #1101. Thanks to\n  Munzir Taha (@munzirtaha) for the report.\n- Backport search fixes from 4.3:\n\n  - Normalize how the search \"Match all\" parameter is evaluated.\n  - Fix evaluation of \"Match all\" when using a single level scoped search.\n  - Improve extraction of URL search query parameters.\n\n4.2.6 (2022-06-25)\n==================\n- Backport document content parsing template method. This fix\n  allows accessing the parsed content of a document directly\n  in a template.\n- Backport permission form widget choice grouping and sorting improvements.\n\n4.2.5 (2022-05-21)\n==================\n- Remove unused authentication view.\n- Task manager app updates:\n\n  - Add backend Celery queue deduplication to the ``CeleryQueue``.\n  - Enable app tests.\n  - Add and improve tests.\n  - Add support for runtime removal of queues.\n\n- Remove unused event link.\n- Make document version OCR submit view messages translatable.\n- Make file caching purge view messages translatable.\n- Make document file metadata submit view messages translatable.\n- Fix asset transformations hash calculation.\n- Fix asset image API view docstring.\n- Fix repeated model manager definition in ``DocumentFilePage``\n  models.\n- Transformation improvements:\n\n  - Fix wrong parameter in the ``ImageDraw.Draw`` usage of the\n    ``TransformationDrawRectangle`` transformation.\n  - Add sanity check to reject negative zoom values for the\n    ``TransformationZoom`` transformation.\n\n- Add warning message when users attempting to delete their own accounts.\n- Convert the signal handler that triggers search indexing on many to many\n  fields changes into a background task. Solves user interface blocking\n  when changing the document type to index template association on large\n  installations.\n- Update Django from version 3.2.12 to 3.2.13.\n- Retry search indexing task when the object is not found. There are\n  situations where the broker will route the message to the workers faster\n  than the database can commit the data.\n- Fix favorite document links reacting to favorite documents beyond the\n  active user. Closes GitLab issue #1104. Thanks to\n  Biel Frontera (@bielfrontera) for the report and initial implementation.\n\n4.2.4 (2022-04-29)\n==================\n- Fix the documentation paths to the OTP backends.

Thanks to Matthias Löblich (@startmat) for the\n  report.\n- Fix Docker pull counter.\n- Remove repeated Whoosh backend line of code from merge.\n- Add portainer installation files and documentation.\n- Remove hardcoded search model variable name from ``search_box.html``\n  template.\n- Fix the search model API URL reference. Closes GitLab issue #1098. Thanks\n  to Bastian (@Basti-Fantasti) for the report.\n- Use the ``SEARCH_MODEL_NAME_KWARG`` instead of hard coding the search model\n  API URL reference.\n- Filter trashed documents from the tag document count column.\n- Filter trashed documents from the cabinet document retrieval method. This\n  brings code parity with tags which work in a very similar way.\n- Improve Python 3.10 compatibility. Add a compatibility module to\n  encapsulate import of the ``Iterable`` class. Improves GitLab issue #1083.\n  Thanks to Bw (@bwakkie) for the report and code samples.\n- Type cast LUT values when masking an asset for pasting via Pillow's\n  ``point()``.\n- Document metadata edit form validation updates:\n\n  - Remove ``disabled`` attribute from the metadata type label field to\n    avoid having its value removed when there is a validation error.\n  - Remove the ``required`` flag from the value field when there is a\n    required metadata for a document. The previous behavior cause the tabular\n    form to display \"(required)\" in column title confusing users and causing\n    them to think that all metadata type fields were required.\n  - Raise validation error for specific required metadata entries and no for\n    the entire form. This help users better understand which metadata field\n    needs to be corrected.\n  - Improve the required metadata validation logic to take into account\n    existing values and empty forms when data was entered into the field\n    but the update checkbox was left unchecked.\n\n- Bulk object search indexing updates:\n\n  - Retry failed bulk indexing tasks.\n  - Add max retry value to ``task_index_search_models``.\n  - Improve tasks error logging.\n\n- Update the Debian Docker image from version 11.2-slim to 11.3-slim.\n- Downgrade the Python Docker image from version 3.11-slim to 3.10-slim.\n- Pin Jinja2 version to workaround Sphinx bug. Sphinx Jinja2 dependency is\n  not pinned or immutable, and causes the installation of an incompatible\n  version breaking builds.\n\n4.2.3 (2022-04-01)\n==================\n- Add restart policy to the Traefik container definition.\n- Remove duplicated ``Document.get_label`` method.\n- Fix an issue where a staging folder would not tag uploaded\n  documents.\n\n4.2.2 (2022-03-21)\n==================\n- Ensure the object copy permission is required for the object copy link.\n- Migrate old workflow ``EmailAction`` instances instead of sub-classing\n  for backwards compatibility. Improves commit\n  ``b522dac80f7f6cfb8c5db8a74d6d2d22bc8b281a`` and avoids a double entry in\n  the workflow state action selection downdown list.\n- Ensure new document and file links access works like their respective\n  views. The links will be active when the access is granted for the source\n  as well as the document/document type.\n- Filter unread message count badge by message read permission.\n- Update document metadata model field label from \"Metadata type value\"\n  to \"Metadata value\".\n- Fix document file signature serializer label.\n\n4.2.1 (2022-02-16)\n==================\n- Merge improvements from version 4.1.6.\n\n  - Append the text \"signed\" to the label of a signed document file instead\n    of using the temporary filename used during signing.\n  - Ensure the signed document file is used when the file downloaded is\n    requested and when calculating the signed document file checksum.\n    Solves issue in forum post 6149. Thanks to forum user @qra for the report\n    and debug information.\n  - Update IMAP source ``store commands`` to be optional.\n  - Update email sources ``SSL`` checkbox to be optional.\n  - Undo POP3 source context manager changes from commit\n    c19040491e20c9a783ae6191613bc8c5f7acb038. It seems Python's email libraries\n    do not have feature parity. ``imaplib`` was updated to support context\n    managers but ``poplib`` was not.\n\n- Update requirements to specify Python version 3.6 to 3.9.\n- Update Django version 3.2.11 to 3.2.12.\n\n4.2 (2022-02-12)\n================\n- Update Django to version 3.2.11.\n- Update django-widget-tweaks from version 1.4.8 to 1.4.9.\n- File staging sources updates:\n\n  - Use ``StreamingHttpResponse`` to serve previews.\n  - Support office document files for preview.\n  - Fix extra brackets in the encoded and cached filenames.\n  - Simplify image generation.\n  - Use context manager to ensure preview images are always closed.\n\n- Hide all links that depend on users being authenticated.\n- Add support for return binary content in batch API requests as a base64\n  string.\n- Add support for dynamic field API serialization. This feature adds the\n  URL query keys ``_fields_only`` and ``_fields_exclude``. Nested serializers\n  are supported using the double underscore (``__``) separator.\n- Refactor ``ResolverRelatedManager``.\n- Move Docker templates to their own folder.\n- Move the ``docker-dockerfile-update`` target to the Docker makefile.\n- Update Docker image tags:\n\n  - Postgresq from 10.18-alpine to 12.9-alpine.\n  - Python from 3.8-slim to 3.11-slim.\n\n- Update psycopg2 from version 2.8.6 to 2.9.2.\n- Update redis client from version 3.5.3 to 4.0.2.\n- Reduce the Sentry client default ``traces_sample_rate`` from 0.25 to 0.05.\n- Add the ``run_initialsetup_or_performupgrade`` command to the Docker\n  entrypoint.\n- Docker Compose updates:\n\n  - Add a Redis profile.\n  - Default to RabbitMQ a broker.\n  - Change default RabbitMQ image from 3.9-alpine to 3.9-management-alpine.\n  - Improve Traefik configuration.\n  - Add a dedicated network for Traefik.\n\n- Completed the Whoosh backend and made it the default search backend.\n\n    - Ensure all test models are deleted, including intermediate many\n      to many models created automatically.\n    - Update ``DetailForm`` usage for the new interface.\n    - Move `flatten_list` to the common app.\n    - ResolverPipeline updates:\n\n      - Support ``resolver_extra_kwargs``.\n      - Add queryset exclusion support to ``ResolverRelatedManager``.\n\n    - Update related field resolution using pure Django\n    - Solve all search indexing edge cases.\n    - Models are indexed using smaller tasks to improve scalability.\n    - Refactor ``ResolverRelatedManager``.

Authentication backends are\n    able to control and customize the entire login process, including\n    the forms presented to the user. Authentication backends can use mixins\n    and can be subclassed to mix and expand their capabilities.\n    Included authentication mixins: ``AuthenticationBackendRememberMeMixin``\n    Included authentication backends:\n    ``AuthenticationBackendModelDjangoDefault``,\n    ``AuthenticationBackendModelEmailPassword``,\n    ``AuthenticationBackendModelUsernamePassword``.\n    Apps define authentication backends in the module\n    ``authentication_backends.py``.\n  - Removed the now unused ``EmailAuthBackend`` class.\n  - New settings:\n\n    - ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND`` which must be the dotted path\n      to the backend used to process user authentication.\n    - ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` which is an optional YAML\n      structure to pass to the authentication backend.\n\n- Add Time based One Time Password (TOTP) support. To enable set the\n  setting ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND`` to\n  ``mayan.apps.authentication_otp.authentication_backends.AuthenticationBackendModelUsernamePasswordTOTP``\n  for username and TOTP login. For email and TOTP logins use\n  ``mayan.apps.authentication_otp.authentication_backends.AuthenticationBackendModelEmailPasswordTOTP``.\n  New management commands to support OTP:\n\n    - ``authentication_otp_disable``: disables OTP for a user\n    - ``authentication_otp_initialize``: initializes the OTP state data for\n      all users. This command is for debuging and maintenance in case the\n      database migration does not correctly initialize the OTP state data\n      for existing users.\n    - ``authentication_otp_status``: display the OTP status for a user\n\n- Add URL links to the document file and document version first pages\n  to the document serializer in the API.\n- Convert the download file deletion interval into a setting named\n  ``DOWNLOAD_FILE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL`` which defaults to 2 days.\n- Convert the shared uploaded file deletion interval into a setting named\n  ``SHARED_UPLOADED_FILE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL`` which defaults to 7 days.\n- Don't display API URL links to indexing instance and template parents that\n  are also root nodes as these are not accessible.\n- Register more models using ``DynamicSerializerField`` to display the\n  canonical serializer of the model when referenced by other objects.\n- For object that have children objects or that support nesting, the parent\n  object ID is now added to the serializer. The layout is\n  ``{parent object name}_id``. A few objects already provided the parent ID\n  but with a different schema. These objects also now have the parent ID\n  field with the new schema even if it displays a duplicate value. The old\n  ID field is now deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0.\n- Added a workflow state column displaying all created actions labels\n  separated by a comma.\n- Added the mailing profile created and edited events.\n- User menu and views updates:\n\n  - Reorganize all user links under a single \"User details\" link.\n  - Allow editing the locale profile of users.\n  - Allow editing the theme settings of users.\n  - Unify user data related views.\n  - Add \"User theme edited\" and \"User locale profile edited\" events.\n\n- Update the Django debug view CSS and layout to match Django's original\n  appearance.\n- Support Django debug JavaScript code.\n- Minor CSS optimization to the Django debug view.\n- Add Docker Compose password randomizer.\n- Include LDAP libraries and Python modules.\n- Events app updates:\n\n  - Use the correct attribute for fetching event types. Use ``id`` instead of\n    ``name``.\n  - Cache the event type instance in the StoredEvent model.\n  - An incorrect event type ID will now return a KeyError instead of masking\n    the exception and returning an error message. It is now up to the calling\n    code which action to take when the event type ID is not correct.\n  - The previous unknown event error message is now available as a literal\n    named ``literals.TEXT_UNKNOWN_EVENT_ID``.\n\n- Add workflow template transition trigger API. Closes GitLab\n  issue #1044. Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for\n  the request and research.\n- Fine tune workflow template permissions to require the view permission\n  instead of the edit permission when applicable.\n- Error log updates:\n\n    - Added a global error log list to the tools menu.\n    - Error log partitions now link to their underline object via content type\n      too.\n    - Error log partitions are now retrieve or created on demand.\n    - Added cascade permission support to error log partitions and entries.\n\n- Update the ``ObjectActionAPIView`` view to allow passing extra context to\n  serializers.\n- Add support for launching workflows from the API.\n- Refactor language activation to work with Django 3.2.\n- Added the mailing profile created and edited events.\n- Remove workflow instance exception usage. Current state property is now\n  inspected.\n- Remove menu proxy inclusions. Model proxies are now included by default.\n- Add menu proxy exclusions.\n- Update the subject and body fields of the document email workflow action\n  to be optional.\n- Redirect to current user to user detail view after password change.\n- Support two different ``psycopg2`` versions for upgrade testing.\n\n4.1.11 (2023-03-08)\n===================\n- Install OS and Python dependencies as separate makefile targets.\n- Remove the Python Transifex client. The new Go based client is required to\n  be installed manually when working with translations\n  (https://github.com/transifex/cli).\n- Sanitize tag labels to avoid XSS abuse (CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS).\n  This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be\n  used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to\n  or removal from a document.\n\n  It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or\n  expose arbitrary information with this weakness.\n\n  Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and\n  is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors\n  to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.\n\n  It is also being incorrectly reported that this weakness can be used to\n  steal the session cookie and impersonate users. Since version 1.4\n  (March 23, 2012) Django has included the ``httponly``\n  attribute for the session cookie. This means that the session cookie data,\n  including ``sessionid``, is no longer accessible from JavaScript.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/1.4/\n\n  Mayan EDMS currently uses Django 3.2. Under this version of Django\n  The ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` defaults to ``True``, which enables the\n  ``httponly`` for the session cookie making it inaccessible to JavaScript\n  and therefore not available for impersonation via session hijacking.\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#session-cookie-httponly\n\n  Django's ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` setting is not currently exposed by\n  Mayan EDMS' setting system, therefore it is not possible to disable this\n  protection by conventional means.\n\n  Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making\n  it easy to track down any bad actors.\n\n  Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is\n  very limited, if any.\n\n  There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this\n  weakness to expose or destroy data.\n- Pin Jinja2 version to workaround Sphinx bug. Sphinx Jinja2 dependency is\n  not pinned or immutable, and causes the installation of an incompatible\n  version breaking builds.\n- Support a local environment config file names ``config-local.env``.\n  This file is ignored by Git and meant to override values of ``config.env``.\n- Support multi `psycopg2` versions for testing. Upgrade testing now uses\n  ``PYTHON_PSYCOPG2_VERSION_PREVIOUS`` for the previous version when testing\n  against PostgreSQL.\n- Improve Python 3.10 compatibility. Add a compatibility module to\n  encapsulate import of the ``Iterable`` class.\n- Move ``SearchModel.flatten_list`` to the common app ``utils.py`` module.\n- Move the helper module ``version.py`` to the dependencies app.\n- GitOps improvements and backports:\n\n  - Add configurable remote branch for GitOps.\n  - Add makefile targets to trigger standalone builds.\n  - Reuse Python build in stages.\n  - Convert branches into literals.\n  - Remove duplicated code in jobs.\n  - Split GitLab CI targets into their own makefile.\n  - Increase artifact expiration.\n  - Add PIP and APT caching to documentation and python build\n    stages.\n  - Add GitLab CI job dependencies.\n  - Enable Buildkit builds.\n  - Use APT proxy and cache in more places.\n  - Cache Alpine APK packages.\n  - Clean up cache directory definitions.\n  - Update APT cache to be at ``.cache/apt``.\n  - Add multi cache support.\n  - Add GitLab CI cache template tags.\n  - Update deployment stages.\n  - Don't push to the master branch on nightly or testing releases.\n\n- Add a custom REST API exception handler to workaround inconsistent\n  validation exception behavior in Django REST framework\n  (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/2145).\n\n4.1.10 (2022-11-13)\n===================\n- Fixes from version 4.0.23.\n\n4.1.9 (2022-04-24)\n==================\n- Remove hardcoded search model variable name from ``search_box.html``\n  template.\n\n4.1.8 (2022-04-23)\n==================\n- Fix the search model API URL reference.

Improves commit\n  ``b522dac80f7f6cfb8c5db8a74d6d2d22bc8b281a`` and avoids a double entry in\n  the workflow state action selection dropbox.\n- Partials navigation updates:\n\n  - Streamline JavaScript partials navigation code.\n  - Make the AJAX response redirect code configurable. New setting\n    ``APPEARANCE_AJAX_REDIRECTION_CODE`` added.\n  - Remove repeated AJAX redirection middleware.\n\n- Add keyword arguments to zip file calls.\n- ``PartialNavigation.js`` improvements.\n\n  - Clean URL query on form submit and use form data as the URL query.\n  - Remove dead code.\n  - Use constants where appropriate.\n\n- Backport new document link condition logic. Ensure new document and file\n  links access works like their respective views. The links will be active\n  when the access is granted for the source as well as the document/document\n  type.

Thanks to forum user @qra for the report\n  and debug information.\n- Update IMAP source ``store commands`` to be optional.\n- Update email sources ``SSL`` checkbox to be optional.\n- Undo POP3 source context manager changes from commit\n  c19040491e20c9a783ae6191613bc8c5f7acb038. It seems Python's email libraries\n  do not have feature parity. ``imaplib`` was updated to support context\n  managers but ``poplib`` was not.\n- Update requirements to specify Python version 3.5 to 3.9.\n- Update Django version 2.2.24 to 2.2.27.\n\n4.1.5 (2022-02-03)\n==================\n- Fix CAA document links. Closes GitLab issue #1068. Thanks to\n  Matthias Löblich (@startmat) for the report.\n- Remove superfluous apostrophe character in sort heading markup.\n- Fix email sources processing a single message but performing cleanup on\n  multiple messages. The intended behavior is restore which processed one\n  message and cleans up the processed message only.\n- Fix reference to ``shared_uploaded_files`` before the variable being\n  available.\n- Use context managers for the IMAP and POP3 sources to remove the\n  possibility of orphaned descriptors.\n- Create error log entries for objects that existed before the last error\n  log changes. Fix GitLab issue #1069. Thanks to Will Wright (@fireatwill)\n  for the report.\n- Expose the workflow template ``auto_launch`` field via the REST API.\n  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.\n- Add ``EmailAction`` subclass for backwards compatibility with existing\n  workflow state actions.\n- Expose the checkout datetime, expiration datetime and user fields via the\n  REST API.

Thanks to Will Wright (@fireatwill)\n  for the report and the patch.\n- Add libjpeg and libpng to the dev setup target.\n- Fix editing OCR content via the API.\n- Fix the ``AdvancedSearchViewTestCaseMixin`` class. It had\n  ``GenericViewTestCase`` as a base class when it is supposed to be a mixin\n  and not have any.\n- Add ``AutoHelpTextLabelFieldMixin``. This mixin tries to extract the\n  label and help text from the model field when the serializer field does\n  not specify any.\n- Add filtering to the ``parent`` field of the index template node\n  serializers. Restrict options to the current index template and allows\n  removing the now redundant validation.\n- Add ``index_template_root_node_id`` field to the index template\n  serializer. Closes GitLab issue #1061. Thanks to\n  Ludovic Anterieur(@lanterieur) for the report and initial implementation.\n- Fix responsive menu close button triggering home navigation. Closes\n  GitLab issue #1057. Thanks to Raimar Sandner (@PiQuer) for the report and\n  debug information.\n- JavaScript optimizations:\n\n  - Cache argument length when in ``.fn.hasAnyClass``.\n  - Configure fancybox just once.\n  - Set converter image functions as ``async``.\n  - Remove jQuery's ``one`` usage.\n\n- Remove the error logger model locking and cache the model value instead\n  at the time of registration. Closes GitLab issue #1065. Thanks to\n  Will Wright (@fireatwill) for the report and debug information.\n- Rename ``ErrorLog`` model to ``StoredErrorLog``. This change follow the\n  normal paradigm when a service is provided by a model and a runtime class.\n- Make the ``StoredErrorLog`` name field unique to ensure ``get_or_create``\n  works in an atomic way.\n- Create the error log partition when the model instance is created.\n- Normalize the error log partition name format using a static method.\n- Delete the error log partition on model instance deletion and not just the\n  error log partition entries.\n- Ensure a memory database is used when running the tests.\n\n4.1.3 (2021-11-02)\n==================\n- Vagrant updates\n\n  - Load installation value from ``config.env`` file.\n  - Update supervisord during installation.\n  - Setup the APT proxy during installation.\n  - Change how APT and PIP proxies are defined to match the Docker build\n    target.\n  - Add makefile for vagrant.\n  - Move devpi targets to the main makefile.\n\n- Sentry client backend updates:\n\n  - Add more SDK options.\n  - Add typecasting to options.\n  - Add debug logging.\n  - Add Celery integration.\n  - Add Redis Integration.\n  - Lower the default value of ``traces_sample_rate`` from 1 to 0.25.\n    This value is better suited for production deployments. Increase to 1\n    for full debug information capture during development or testing.\n\n- File staging sources updates:\n\n  - Use ``StreamingHttpResponse`` to serve previews.\n  - Support previews for office document files.\n  - Fix extra brackets in the encoded and cached filenames.\n  - Simplify image generation.\n  - Use context manager to ensure preview images are always closed.\n\n- Sources app updates:\n\n  - Don't assume all source backends provide an upload form.\n  - Improve SANE scanner error handling.\n  - Fix logging of non interactive source errors.\n  - Show interactive source processing as a message.\n\n- Fix the copying of the bootstrap alert style.\n- Optimize the copying of the boostrap alert style by executing it only\n  in the root template. This runs the code just once instead of running it\n  on each page refresh. The element ``#div-javascript-dynamic-content`` was\n  also remove and it is now created and destroyed dynamically once just.\n- Ensure that the ``resolved_object`` is injected into the context before\n  passing the context to the link's ``check_condition`` method. Suspected\n  cause of the GitLab issue #1052 and #1049. Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur\n  (@lanterieur) and Johannes Bornhold (@joh5) for the reports and debug\n  information.\n- Converter updates:\n\n  - Fix duplicate asset display. Closes GitLab issue #1053. Thanks to\n    Ryan Showalter (@ryanshow) for the report.\n  - Split the transformation ``cache_hash`` method to allow subclasses to\n    modify how the cache hash is calculated.\n  - Include the asset image hash into the asset transformation hash\n    calculation. This change invalidates all cached page images that\n    use an asset if the asset image is modified.\n  - Improve the way the absolute coordinates of the percentage asset paste\n    transformation are calculated.\n\n- Use redirection instead of the ``output_file`` argument to allow the SANE\n  scanner source to work with more SANE scanner versions.\n\n4.1.2 (2021-10-27)\n==================\n- Don't insert the value ``ORGANIZATIONS_URL_BASE_PATH`` in the path\n  then it is ``None``.\n- Fix ``ModelTemplateField`` not displaying the ``initial_help_text``\n  for the specific usage instance. The ``initial_help_text`` was\n  being removed from the ``kwargs`` in the ``ModelTemplateField``\n  as well as the super class.\n- Workflows improvements.\n\n  - Use the templating widget for the workflow document properties\n    modification and the HTTP request actions.\n  - Consolidate the workflow action help text.\n\n- Fix issue when attempting to create a Document version page OCR update\n  workflow action. Instead of the model class, the template form field now\n  passes the ``app_label`` and the ``model_name`` of the model via the\n  widget attributes to avoid Django's attribute template to attempt\n  getting a string representation of the model.\n\n4.1.1 (2021-10-26)\n==================\n- Move Docker Compose variables to the correct file. Move\n  ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` and ``COMPOSE_PROFILES`` to the\n  .env file.\n- Fix asset image generation. Closes GitLab issue #1047 for series 4.1.\n  Thanks to Ryan Showalter (@ryanshow) for the report and debug information.\n- Improve sidebar menu heading display logic.\n- Fix leftover HTML markup in the server error dialog window.\n- Remove redundant close button for the server error dialog window.\n- Merged fixes and improvements from versions 4.0.17 and 4.0.18.\n- Update PIP from version 21.2.4 to 21.3.1.\n- Remove MySQL upgrade CD/CI testing pipeline stage until support is properly\n  re-implemented for version 8.0.\n- Add CD/CI triggers for local testing.\n- Exclude all migration tests by tagging automatically at the\n  ``MayanMigratorTestCase`` subclass definition.\n- Support multiple environments per dependency.\n- Update the ``wheel`` library to be a dependency of the ``build`` and the\n  ``documentation`` environments to workaround a bug in PIP that causes\n  ``\"error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'\"``.\n\n4.1 (2021-10-10)\n================\n- Add support for editing the document version page OCR content.\n  Closes GitLab issue #592.

Remove PseudoFile and SourceUploaded\n    classes. Each source backend is now responsible for providing\n    a list of shared uploaded files.\n\n- Multiform improvements:\n\n  - Support multi form extra kwargs.\n  - Move the dynamic part of the multi form method to the end\n    of the name.\n  - Add a white horizontal ruler to separate the form\n    instances.\n\n- Consolidate the image generation task:\n\n  - Remove document file, version, converter asset, and workflow template\n    preview image generation.\n  - Remove converter literal `TASK_ASSET_IMAGE_GENERATE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove workflow literals `TASK_GENERATE_WORKFLOW_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove `document_states_fast` queue.\n  - Remove documents literals\n    `DEFAULT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY` and\n    `DEFAULT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n  - Remove settings\n    `DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY` and\n    `DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`.\n\n- Search updates\n\n  - Remove `TASK_RETRY_DELAY` and use `retry_backoff`.\n  - Add the tag color as a search field\n  - Improve and simplify query cleaning up by doing so after the\n    scopes are decoded.\n  - Fix Whoosh reindexing after m2m fields perform a remove.\n  - Fix Whoosh search for related m2m fields with multiple\n    values.\n  - Improve tests for edge cases.\n  - Fix document version API tests module.\n  - Variables renamed for clarity and to specify their purpose.\n  - Process the 'q' parameter at the class and not in the\n    backend.\n  - Ignore invalid query fields.\n  - Index for search on m2m signal.\n  - Return empty results on an empty query.\n  - Produce an empty scope 0 on an empty query.\n  - Improve tests.\n  - Add UUID field for all document child objects.\n\n- Add detail view for groups.\n- Show total permission when running the `purgepermissions` command.\n- Add detail for file partitions.\n- Add placeholder absolute links for announcements, workflow templates, quotas.\n- Add detail view for stored permissions.\n- Rename role setup views.\n- Load user management first to allow patching\n- Register ACL events when enabling ACLs. Objects that are registered to\n  support ACLs will also be registered for ACL events to allow subscribing to\n  ACL changes of the object.\n- Allow bind either the events links, the subscription link, both or none.\n- Improve workflow app navigation.\n- Improve sidebar navigation.\n- Improve clarity of the action dropdown sections.\n- Make the index instance node value field an unique field among its own tree\n  level.

Does not rely anymore of importing an event\n    for it to become recognized.\n  - Allow loading events by their name. Avoid doing direct imports when\n    there circular dependencies.\n  - Move the events app to the top of the installed apps to allow it to\n    preload all events.\n  - Only show the event clear and export links for object whose events\n    that can be cleared and exported.\n\n- ACLs apps updates:\n\n  - The ACL edited event is now triggered only once when all permissions are\n    changed.\n  - The action object of the ACL edited event is now the content object and\n    not the permission.\n\n- Enable event subscriptions for workflow states, workflow state actions,\n  and workflow transitions.\n- Support deleting multiple roles in a single action.\n- OCR app updates:\n\n  - Use ``MultipleObjectDeleteView`` for the delete view.\n  - Rename single and multiple delete view names.\n  - Improve tests.\n\n- Document comments app API updates:\n\n  - Modernize code to use latest internal interfaces.\n  - Exclude trashed documents.\n  - Reduce serializers.\n  - Return error 404 on insufficient access.\n\n- Document indexing API updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents.\n  - Split tests.\n  - Add event checking to remaining tests.\n\n- Events app API updates:\n\n  - Return error 404 on insufficient permissions.\n  - Modernize `APIObjectEventListView` to use latest interfaces\n    and mixins.\n\n- Document parsing app updates:\n\n  - Update API to latest internal interfaces.\n  - Add testing for multiple document file content delete views.\n  - Speed up tests.\n  - Add event checking to tests.\n  - Use `MultipleObjectDeleteView` for the file content delete view.\n  - Improve text string of the `DocumentFileContentDeleteView` view.\n\n- Document signatures app updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from the API.\n  - Add event checking to tests.\n  - Track user when uploading signature files.\n\n- Workflows app updates:\n\n  - Split API views.\n  - Add trashed document test.\n  - Code style updates.\n\n- Smart link app refactor:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from API.\n  - Improve existing tests.\n  - Add additional tests.\n  - Rebuild the resolved smart link API and serializer.\n  - Add a new permission to view resolved smart links. This permission needs\n    to be granted for the smart link and for the document/document type.\n  - Update API to return error 404 on insufficient access.\n  - Remove unused test mixins.\n  - Split view and API test modules.\n\n- Documents app updates:\n\n  - Exclude trashed documents from all API views.\n  - New `valid` model managers for recently accessed, recently created, and\n    favorite documents. These managers exclude trashed documents at the model\n    level. The 'objects' manager for these model returns the unfiltered\n    queryset.\n  - Trashed document delete API now returns a 202 code instead of 204. The\n    delete method now runs in the background in the same way as the trashed\n    document delete view works in the UI. The return code was updated to\n    reflect this internal change.\n  - Track the user for the trashed document delete, restore and for the\n    trash can empty methods.\n  - Add event checking for some remaining tests.\n  - Add additional tests.\n\n- Add ``BackendDynamicForm``, a dynamic form for interacting with backends.\n- Add a reusable backend class named ``mayan.apps.databases.classes.BaseBackend``.\n\n- Refactor mailer app:\n\n  - Allow sending document files and document versions as attachments.\n  - Update the ``UserMailer`` model to work with the ``BackendModelMixin``\n    mixin.

Removes\n    dynamic form schema from the views.\n  - Use ``BackendDynamicForm`` and remove dynamic form code from the forms\n    module.\n  - Generalize document file and document version to support any type of\n    object.\n  - Update workflow action to send links to documents or attach the active\n    versions.\n  - Use the reusable ``BaseBackend`` class and remove explicit backend\n    scaffolding.\n\n- Improve test open file and descriptor leak detection.\n- Close storage model file after inspection as Django creates a new\n  file descriptor on inspection.\n- Ensure the name and not the path is used. Compressed files can include\n  path references, these are now scrubbed and only the filename of the file\n  in the compressed archive is used.\n- File handling was improved. Context managers are now used for temporary\n  files and directories. This ensure file descriptors are closed and freed up\n  in all scenarios.\n- Add detached signature deleted event.\n- Document signature app general improvements. Renamed links, icons and\n  view for clarity. Split tests modules.\n- Metadata API updates:\n\n  - Unify document type metadata type serializers.\n  - Update the permission layout to match the one of the views.\n    The edit or view permission is now required for the document\n    type as well as the metadata type.\n\n- Add ``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` to control how many times\n  the image regeration task will retry lock errors.\n- Add support for appending all document file pages as a single document\n  version.\n- Moved signals, hooks and events outside of the document file creation\n  transaction.\n- Capture the user for the document version page reset and remap action\n  events.\n- Add conditions to the favorite document links.\n- Update mailing icons.\n- Remove submit button label and submit button icons.\n- The ``performupgrade`` command won't try to hide critical errors and\n  instead raise any exception to obtain the maximum amount of debug\n  information.\n- Add support to filter the add/remove choice form.\n- Dependencies app updates:\n\n  - Move the link to check for the latest version to the tools\n    menu.\n  - Checking for updates now required the view dependencies\n    permission.\n\n- Unify request resolution for navigation classes.\n- Support retrieving a list of ``SourceColumn`` by name.\n- Dashboard app updates:\n\n  - Extend dashboard widget interfaces.\n  - Add list dashboard widget.\n  - Move dashboard CSS from the appearance app to the dashboards app.\n  - Add dashboard list and detail views.\n  - Add setting to select the default dashboard.\n  - Add template tag to display the default dashboard in the home\n    view.\n\n- Refactor ``SourceColumn.get_for_source``.\n- Add ``RecentlyAccessedDocumentProxy`` to allow adding a column with the\n  creation date time.\n- Navigation refactor:\n\n  - Rewritten link to source matching code.\n  - Rewritten menu resolution.\n  - Pass the ``resolved_object`` to link conditions.\n\n- Don't trigger the settings change flag on user language changes.\n- Add settings to allow changing the default and the maximums\n  REST API page size.\n- Add support for service client backends to the platform app.\n- Add Sentry.io service client backend.\n- Support overriding form buttons.\n- Improve metadata type form tab order. Disables metadata type name field\n  to skip them during tabbing.\n- Support step rewinding for the sources wizard.\n- Add support for recoding email Message ID. The email source can now record\n  an email Message ID from the header as it is processed into a documents.\n  All documents created from the same email will have the same Message ID.\n  Thanks to forum user qra (@qra) for the request.\n\n- Improve `BaseBackend` class\n\n  - Add deterministic parent base backend class detection.\n  - Register backend class only to their respective parent base\n    backend classes.\n\n- Render main menu icons properly. The change in\n  bbbb92edb85f192987fdfb4efc574bd79221b6ed removed literal CSS icon\n  support. A single reference to the old CSS icon render was left behind\n  which cause the icon object Python memory location to be rendered\n  inline with the menu HTML. This cause the same menu to have different\n  hashes when rendered by the different Gunicorn workers. Solved GitLab\n  issue #1038. Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for the report.\n- Add setting to change the menu polling interval. Values specified in\n  milliseconds. Use `None` to disable.\n- Enforce ``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` setting and add logging\n  message when the maximum retires are exhausted.\n- Messaging app updates:\n\n  - Add API views.\n  - Exclude superusers and staff users from being message recipients.\n  - Add dedicated create message form.\n  - Use Select2 for the user selection field.\n  - Add message edit permission. This permission is required in order to\n    change the message read status.\n\n- Add ``get_absolute_api_url`` method to download files, document versions\n  and users. These URL are used to determine the message sender's API URL.\n- Test view mixin updates:\n\n  - Add a default ordering to the ``TestModel`` to silence warning.\n  - Fix ``TestModel.save()`` method.\n  - Support multiple test views per test case.\n  - Allow subclasses to supply their own ``urlpatterns``.\n  - Support passing arguments to ``add_test_view``.\n\n- Add batch API request support.\n- Adjust event registrations:\n\n  - Register cabinet document add and remove events to the Document model too.\n  - Register document file parsing events to the Document model too.\n  - Rename label of the document parsed content deleted event.\n  - Replace the ``DownloadFile`` content object registration from the\n    ``Document`` model to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n  - Register the document file created, edited events to the ``Document``\n    model too.\n  - Register the document version created, edited events to the ``Document``\n    model too.\n  - Register the document trashed event to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Remove the document file created event from the ``DocumentFile`` model.\n  - Remove the document version created event from the ``DocumentVersion``\n    model.\n  - Register the document version page deleted event to the\n    ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n  - Remove the document version page deleted event from the\n    ``DocumentVersionPage`` model.\n  - Register the tag attached, removed events to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Register the web link navigated event to the ``Document`` model too.\n  - Remove the document version page OCR edited event from the ``Document``\n    model.\n  - Register the document version OCR submitted, finished, content deleted\n    events to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.\n\n- Sort object and list facet links when using the list item view.\n- Rename environment variable ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_JITTER`` to\n  ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_REQUESTS_JITTER``.\n- Support changing the operating system user when creating the supervisord\n  file using the environment variable ``MAYAN_OS_USERNAME``.\n- Reorder the Gunicorn arguments.\n- Make the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable an alias of\n  ``MAYAN_SETTINGS_MODULE`` in the supervisord file.\n- Add ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY`` to the gunicorn invocation in\n  the ``run_frontend.sh`` batch file.\n- Frontend updates:\n\n  - Ensure list groups use <ul> and <li> instead of plain <div>.\n  - Move ``mayan_image.js`` to the converter app.\n  - Update ``afterBaseLoad`` to work by defining a list of callbacks. This\n    allows defining callbacks from different apps.\n  - Set JavaScript callbacks and setup method to run in async mode.\n  - Move static inline app CSS to individual CSS files.\n- Fix workflow template API description text. Closes GitLab issue #1042.\n  Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for the report.\n- Add document template state action API endpoints. Closes GitLab issue #1043\n  Thanks to Ludovic Anterieur (@lanterieur) for the request.\n- Pin jsonschema to version 3.2.0 to avoid errors with\n\n4.0.23 (2022-11-13)\n===================\n- Add help text to the `SEARCH_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS` setting.\n- Backport an object storage documentation chapter fix\n  from version 4.4dev0.\n- Don't tag Docker images as ``latest`` for minor releases. As per Docker's\n  specifications, the ``latest`` tag is applied to the latest image built\n  if no tag is specified. It is not meant to represent the latest version\n  of an project, just the last image that has been built. However users\n  commonly (and mistakenly) have come to expect the ``latest`` tag to\n  represent the latest version of the project. The GitLab CI file is\n  updated to fulfill this expectation.\n- Fixes from version 3.5.12.\n- Pin ``importlib-metadata`` to version 4.13.0 to workaround a dependency\n  bug in Kombu.\n- Update tox from version 3.14.6 to 3.27.0.\n- Update Debian container from tag 10.10-slim to 10.13-slim\n\n4.0.22 (2022-04-22)\n===================\n- Filter unread message count badge by message read permission.\n- Remove usage of flat values list in document checkout manager.\n- Remove usage of flat ``values_list`` queryset in metadata managers module.\n- Ensure the object copy permission is required for the object copy link.\n- Update signature view permission label from\n  \"View details of document signature\" to \"View document signatures\".\n- Update document metadata model field label from \"Metadata type value\"\n  to \"Metadata value\".\n- Fix document file signature serializer label.\n- Add restart policy to the Traefik container definition.\n- Remove duplicated ``Document.get_label`` method.\n- Add Docker Compose file port comment to remove when using Traefik.\n- Print the path when failing to access the configuration file.\n- Expose the workflow template ``auto_launch`` field via the REST API.\n  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.\n- Cleanup markup of the confirmation form.\n- Remove redundant modal close button.\n- Fix search proxies method decorator.\n- Reorganize converter office MIME type list.\n- Improve metadata validation error message.\n- Don't display API URL links to indexing instance and template parents that\n  are also root nodes as these are not accessible.\n- Remove repeated partition file close call.\n- Update Django version 2.2.24 to 2.2.28.\n\n4.0.21 (2021-11-29)\n===================\n- Perform more strict cleanup of test models.\n- Clean up the test model app config cache after the test\n  end not before the test model is created.\n- Improve lock manager test cases.\n- Add standalone Celery beat container.\n- Backport transformation ``cache_hash`` method split.\n  Moved to two functions to allow subclasses to modify\n  how the cache hash is calculated.\n- Backport asset image cache invalidation.\n- Backport asset duplication fix.\n- Backport asset percentage position calculation fix.\n- Add an explicit default value for ``MEDIA_URL``.

Remove MySQL test delays.\n- Standardize a class for the widgets of the class ``SourceColumn`` named\n  ``SourceColumnWidget``.\n- The cabinet view permission is now required for a document, to be able to\n  view which cabinets contain that document. This change mirrors the\n  permission layout of the metadata and tag apps.\n- File caching now uses the same lock for all file methods. This ensures that\n  a cache file that is being deleted or purge is not open for reading and\n  vice versa.\n- A method decorator was added to the lock manager app to ease usage of the\n  same lock workflow in methods of the same class.\n- The error handling of the ``CachePartitionFile`` methods was improved.\n  This ensures proper clean up of stray storage files on model file creation\n  error. The model now avoids accessing the model file for clean up on model\n  file creation error, which would raise a hard to understand and diagnose\n  missing file entry error. The model now avoids updating cache size on\n  either model or storage file creation error.\n- Support disabling form help texts via ``form_hide_help_text``.\n- Docker image tagging layout has been updated. Images are tagged by version\n  and series. Series have the 's' prefix and versions have the 'v' prefix.\n- Added API endpoints for the Assets model.\n- Added cached image generation for assets.\n- Added asset detail view with image preview.\n- Added a detail view for the cache model.\n- Added the ``image_url`` field to the Workflow template serializer.\n- Added retry support for the workflow preview generation task.\n- Updated the autoadmin app to use the login template ``login_content``\n  template hook. This allows the autoadmin app to show login information\n  without directly modifying the login template.\n- Update tags app to improve user event tracking on view and API.\n- Support deleting multiple document files.\n- Track document file deletion event user in views.\n- Rename ``setting_workflowimagecache_storage`` to\n  ``setting_workflow_image_cache_storage_backend``.\n- Support collapsing the options of the menus \"list facet\" and \"object\" when\n  in list view mode. This behavior is controlled with the new settings:\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_LIST_FACET`` and\n  ``COMMON_COLLAPSE_LIST_MENU_OBJECT``. Both default to ``False``.\n- Added a check to the task manager app to ensure all defined tasks are\n  properly configure in their respective ``queues.py`` modules.\n- ACL apps updates: Add ACL deleted event, track action actor in API and\n  views. Simply API views using REST API mixins. Update API views to return\n  404 errors instead of 403, move global ACL list to the setup menu,\n  model that are registered for ACLs are now also automatically register\n  events in order to receive the ACL deleted event, improve tests and add more\n  test cases.\n- Update AddRemoveView to only call the underlying add or remove methods only\n  if there are objects to act upon instead of calling the method with an\n  empty queryset which would trigger unwanted events.\n- Add ``ExternalContentTypeObjectAPIViewMixin`` to the REST API app. This\n  mixin simplifies working with models that act upon another object via\n  their Content Type, such as the ACLs.\n- Update the ACL app to support multiple foreign object permission\n  inheritance. Support for ``GenericForeignKey`` non default ``ct_field``,\n  and ``fk_field`` was also added.\n- Added support to export the global events list, object events list and\n  user events list.\n- Registering a model to receive events will cause it to have the object\n  event view and object event subscription links bound too. This can\n  be disabled with the `bind_links` argument. The default menu to bind the\n  links is the \"List facet\". This can be changed via the ``menu`` argument.\n- Change the format of the ``file_metadata_value_of`` helper. The driver\n  and metadata entry are now separated by a double underscore instead of a\n  single underscore. This allows supporting drivers and entries that might\n  contain an underscore themselves.\n- Add ``databases`` app to group data and models related code.\n- Add class support for scoped searches. GitLab issue #875.\n- Add sorting support to the API.\n- Updated how the user interface column sorting works. The code was\n  simplified by using a single query variable. The code was expanded\n  to support multiple fields in the future. The URL query key used for\n  column sorting was changed to match the API sorting.a\n- Added the ``databases`` app. This app groups data and models related code.\n- Added a patch for Django's ``Migration`` class to display time delta for\n  each migration during development.\n- Docker Compose updates:\n\n    - Use profiles for extra containers.\n    - Converted to use extensions to remove duplicated markup.\n    - A new container was added to mount an index.\n    - Added support for Traefik.\n    - Added sample .env file.\n    - Update required Docker Compose to version 1.28.\n\n- Add a third document filename generator that used an UUID plus the original\n  filename of the uploaded file. This generator has the advantage of producing\n  unique filename while also preserving the original filename for reference.\n- Add support for the \"Reply To\" field for sending documents via email and\n  for the mailing workflow actions. Closes GitLab issue #864. Thanks to\n  Kevin Pawsey (@kevinpawsey) for the request.\n- Allow customization of the error condition when generating document images.\n  This allows displaying more icons in addition to the generic document\n  image error with additional contextual information and popup messages\n  explaining the actual error condition.\n- Add key attributes to the document signature serializers. Forum topic 5085.\n  Thanks to forum user @qra for the request.\n- Added key attributes to the document signature model as calculated\n  properties.\n- Move detached signature upload from the created endpoint to a\n  new /uploaded endpoint.\n- Added document signature events.\n- Refactored the workflows app.\n\n    - Rebalance permissions needed to transition a workflow instance.\n      The workflow instance transition permission is now needed for\n      the document and for either the transition or the workflow.\n    - Add more tests including trashed document tests.\n    - Split API tests into instance and template tests.\n    - Add `workflow-instance-log-entry-detail` end point.\n    - Add parent URL fields to serializers.\n    - Allow passing extra data when transitioning a workflow via the API.\n    - Limit state options to workflow when using the API. This matches\n      the UI behavior.\n\n- Renamed the AddRemove view ``main_object_method_add`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_name`` and ``main_object_method_remove`` to\n  ``main_object_method_add_remove_name``.\n- Add ``has_translations`` flag to MayanAppConfig to indicate if the app\n  should have its translation files processed or ignored. Defaults to\n  ``True``.\n- Dependency version upgrades:\n\n  - coverage from 5.1 to 5.5.\n  - Django to 2.2.23.\n  - django-debug-toolbar to 3.2.\n  - django-extensions to 3.1.2.\n  - django-rosetta to 0.9.4.\n  - django-silk to 4.1.0.\n  - flake8 to 3.9.0.\n  - ipython to 7.22.0.\n  - pycounty to 20.7.3.\n  - requests to 2.25.1.\n  - Sphinx to 3.5.4.\n  - sh to 1.14.1.\n  - sphinx-autobuild to 2021.3.14.\n  - sphinx-sitemap to 2.2.0.\n  - sphinxcontrib-spelling to 7.1.0.\n  - tornado to 6.1.\n  - tox from 3.14.6 to 3.23.1.\n  - transifex-client to 0.14.2.\n  - twine to 3.4.1.\n  - wheel to 0.36.2.\n\n- Fix sub workflow launch state action.\n- Convert the workflow instance creation to a background task.\n- File caching app updates\n\n  - Add cache partition purge event.\n  - Use new event decorator.\n  - Use related object as the cache partition purge event action object.\n  - Allow cache prune to retry on LockError.\n  - Add maximum cache prune failure counter.\n  - Remove possible cache file lock name collision.\n\n- Add locking to the duplicated document scan code to workaround race\n  condition in Django bug #19544 when adding duplicated documents via\n  the many to many field ``.add()`` method.\n- Remove the default queue. All tasks must now be explicitly assigned to an\n  app defined queue.\n- Update file cache to use and LRU style eviction logic.\n- Only prune caches during startup if their maximum size changed.\n- Add detection of excessive cache pruning when cache size is too small for\n  the workload.\n- Detect and avoid duplicated queue names.\n- Add a fourth class of worker.\n- Re-balance queues.\n- Rename workers from ``fast``, ``medium``, and ``slow`` to ``A`` (fast),\n  ``B`` (new workers), ``C`` (medium), ``D`` (slow).\n- Add support for passing custom nice level to the workers when using the\n  Docker image ``run_worker`` command. The value is passed via the\n  ``MAYAN_WORKER_NICE_LEVEL`` environment variable. This variable defaults to\n  ``0``.\n- Avoid adding a transformation to a layer for which it was\n  not registered.\n- Add LayerError exception.\n- Fix redaction ACL support.\n- Add support for typecasting the values used to filter the ACL object\n  inherited fields.\n- Rename the ``mayan_settings`` directory, which is used to allow custom\n  setting modules, to the more intuitive ``user_settings``.\n\n\n",
