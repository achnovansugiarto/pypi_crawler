    "description": "atlas\n===\n\n![banner](documentation/banner.png)\n\n**atlas** is a totally **open-source**, **self-hosted**, **interoperable** assistant written in Python 3. It uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with third party skills.\n\nEver wanted to build your own Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant and host it yourself? That's why **atlas** has been created!\n\nIt manages dialog states with the help of the [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions) library and parses natural language with [snips](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu). If snips doesn't fit your needs, you can subclass the `Interpreter` class and make your own üòâ\n\nHave a look at the [üìö documentation folder](documentation).\n\n![PWA Screenshot](pwa_screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n### PIP\n\n`pip install atlas-core` or `pip install atlas-core[snips]` to already include the snips backend.\n\n### Docker\n\n- Build the image with `docker build . -t atlas`\n- Run `docker run --rm -it -v <a folder containing an atlas.yml file>:/atlas -p 5000:5000 atlas`\n\n### Source\n\n`git clone` this repository and run `python setup.py install`.\n\n### NLU backends\n\nOnce installed, **atlas** will not have any dependency with a NLU backend (unless you use `pip install atlas-core[snips]`) . So you may want to install it yourself. Once done, don't forget to use the appropriated interpreter in the `atlas.yml` configuration file.\n\nFor example, if you use [snips-nlu](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu), you must install it with `pip install snips-nlu` and use\n\n```yml\ninterpreter: \n  type: 'atlas.interpreters.snips_interpreter.SnipsInterpreter'\n```\n\nin the atlas configuration file.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è As of now, the PWA exposed at `<server.url>` lacks offline support.\n\nStarts with the prebuilt [sample](example) or make your own by reading below.\n\nThose quick steps use Snips as the NLU backend.\n\n- Once installed, you must configure it using a [configuration file](documentation/CONFIGURATION.md).\n- Drop your training files (appropriate for your backend) into the `<loader.training_path>`, you may use a tool such as [tracy](https://github.com/YuukanOO/tracy) or [chatito](https://github.com/rodrigopivi/Chatito) to generates it.\n- Drop your configuration files into the `<loader.env_path>`.\n- Drop some skills scripts inside `<executor.path>`, each one should be in its own subfolder with an `atlas` file containing the command to run to executes your skill\n- Start a MQTT broker, such as [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)\n- Start atlas with `atlas -c <your_configuration_file_path>.yml`\n- Go to the `<server.url>` in your favorite browser to access the exposed PWA! (you may use another channel if you prefer). By default it uses the `en-US` language, if you want to change it, just add a query parameters such as `http://localhost:5000?lang=fr-FR`\n- That's it!\n\nI encourage you to read the [architecture overview](documentation/OVERVIEW.md) if you want to know how it works alltogether.\n\n## Deploying\n\nIf you want the exposed PWA to work on your mobile device, you will have to use a valid certificate since this is required by web browsers for the Web Speech API to use your mic.\n\nPlease note that the Web Speech API used by the PWA only works in Chrome as far as I know.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! \n\nYou're a developer or just want to know where this project is heading to? Have a look at the [extended TODO](TODO.md) file.\n\nYou want to support **atlas** by giving some money?
