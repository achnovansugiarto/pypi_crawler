    "description": "# Quantum Network Explorer ADK\r\n\r\nThe QNE-ADK is a Quantum Network Explorer - Application Development Kit that allows you to create your own applications and experiments and run them on a simulator.\r\n\r\n## Local development\r\n\r\nWith the ADK you can create your own application from scratch using the ``qne application create`` command\r\n(see section 'Commands' below for more information about the individual commands). An application directory is created with all the necessary files for you to configure.\r\nWhen configuring an application, you specify the different roles and what types of inputs your\r\napplication uses. In addition, you write the functionality of your application using the NetQASM library.\r\n\r\nAfter creating and configuring an application, you can create an experiment for it using the ``qne experiment create``\r\ncommand. A separate experiment directory is created with all the necessary files. When configuring your experiment\r\nyou can give values to the inputs that were specified when creating your application. You also choose which channels\r\nand nodes you use in your network and which role is linked to which node. A network consists of channels and each\r\nchannel consists of two nodes. The nodes can communicate with each other using the channel between them.\r\n\r\nOnce your experiment is configured you are ready to run it using the ``qne experiment run`` command. Your experiment\r\nis parsed and sent to the NetSquid simulator. After some time your experiment run will be finished and a results\r\ndirectory will be generated in which all the results of your experiment are stored. An alternative is to use the\r\n``qne experiment results`` command to show the results on screen.\r\n\r\n## Publishing applications\r\n\r\nWhen your application is finished and you want to share it with the world, an application can be uploaded and\r\npublished after which it can be selected by other users on the QNE platform. After uploading the application\r\n``qne application upload`` a remote experiment must be created ``qne experiment create --remote`` and run\r\n``qne experiment run`` first on the QNE simulator backend successfully before the application can be\r\npublished ``qne application publish``. After the application is published successfully, it can be used by others.\r\nFor commands interacting with the remote QNE server you must log in first ``qne login``.\r\n\r\nInstead of starting from scratch an existing QNE application can be cloned using the ``qne application clone`` command.\r\nA copy of a working application is made to your application directory and can be used as starting point\r\nfor application development.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n- A modern Linux or macOS (10 or 11) 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you donâ€™t have Linux or macOS you could run it via virtualization, e.g. using VirtualBox. If you have Windows 10 or 11 you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) subsystem.\r\n- A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) should be created and activated before creating an application.\r\n- Python version 3.8 or higher.\r\n- NetQASM makes use of SquidASM for which you need credentials in order to use it. These credentials can be obtained by registering on the forum of [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo install all the required packages, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install qne-adk\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installing the qne-adk, you can install SquidASM. Replace '{netsquid-user-name}' and '{netsquid-password}' with the credentials you registered on [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/):\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install squidasm --extra-index-url=https://{netsquid-user-name}:{netsquid-password}@pypi.netsquid.org\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow everything should be setup and ready in order to create your own applications and experiments and run them on the simulator!\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\nThe QNE-ADK uses various commands to create and run your applications and experiments. All the commands are listed below:\r\n\r\n<!--- QNE APPLICATION LIST --->\r\n<details closed>\r\n<summary><b>qne application list</b></summary>\r\nShow a list of all applications and relevant information for each of them.\r\nFor listing remote applications, the user must be logged in.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n```\r\nqne application list [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --remote  List remote applications  [default: False]\r\n  --local   List local applications  [default: False].\r\n  --help    Show this message and exit.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n  qne application list --remote\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!--- QNE APPLICATION INIT --->\r\n<details closed>\r\n<summary><b>qne application init</b></summary>\r\nInitialize an existing application in the current path which is not already registered to QNE-ADK.\r\nThis is needed for applications not created with QNE-ADK, for example when the files come from a\r\nrepository or are directly copied to the file system.\r\nTwo subdirectories <b>src</b> and <b>config</b> will be created when not already there.\r\nWhen application files are in the root directory, but belong to one of the subdirectories, they are moved.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n```\r\nqne application init [OPTIONS] APPLICATION_NAME\r\n\r\n  ./application_name is taken as application directory\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n  APPLICATION_NAME  Name of the application  [required]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --help    Show this message and exit.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n  qne application init application_name\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!--- QNE APPLICATION CREATE --->\r\n<details closed>\r\n<summary><b>qne application create</b></summary>\r\nCreate a new application in your current directory containing all the files that are needed to write your application.\r\nThe application directory name will be based on the value given to <b>application_name</b>.\r\nTwo subdirectories <b>src</b> and <b>config</b> will be created, along with the default files.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n```\r\nqne application create [OPTIONS] APPLICATION_NAME ROLES...\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n  APPLICATION_NAME  Name of the application  [required]\r\n  ROLES...
