    "description": "# Yodel\nYodel is a python library that uses WIFI hardware for remote control purposes. Because it does not rely on wifi hotspots it has a far greater range than simple wifi based remote control solutions at the cost of bandwidth. Yodel is it's own protocol that sits under 80211. Yodel was designed specifically with Raspberry PI robotics in mind however it should work with any linux computer with an appropriate wifi interface.\n\n## Setup and Config\nYodel is not currently on Pypi so to use it you will have to download the code and place your projects in the same directory as the library source. Next, you will need a system with a wifi interface on it that supports Monitor mode and packet injection, if your built in card does not support it look for a USB wifi dongle that supports monitor mode and packet injection. \nI have had a lot of luck with:https://www.amazon.com/Wifi-Antenna-Raspberry-Pi-Instructions/dp/B00H95C0A2/ but many others that will work just fine also exist.\nwhen looking for a wifi dongle it only needs to support 2.4ghz, i would also recommend getting one with an external antenna to improve range. \nOnce you have a supported wifi interface on your system you for the most part are good to go, you probably want 2 computers with supported hardware as without this you will only be able to talk with yourself. \nyou will need to get the interface id for the wifi interface you would like to use, this can be done with the \"iw dev\" command. \nthis will be needed in the \"yodel.setInterface\" function call in your code.\n\n## Documentation:\n\n### RADIO CONFIGURATION:\n\n  #### yodel.setInterface(str)\n\n    set the interface that yodel should operate on, will auto configure that interface.\n    interfaces need to support monitor mode and packet injection. \n    (a list of valid interfaces can be found by using the \"iw dev\" command)\n  #### yodel.setChannel(int):\n\n    set what radio channel is being used.\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels\n    using something in the 2.4ghz band (channels 1-11) will give best results.\n    some leakage between channels will occur, in other words, if you are sending on channel 1  \n    some of your messages can still be picked up by a robot listening on channel 2\n    increasing the distance between the channels will reduce this.\n  #### yodel.setPower(int (dBm))\n\n    set transmission power, using this may damage your wifi hardware.\n    wifi interfaces usually sit somewhere between 2000dbm and 3000dbm.\n    currently a limit of 3500 dBm is hardcoded to reduce odds of damaging hardware.\n    this is hardcoded around line 70 in config.py.\n   ** check local laws before adjusting your interfaces power. **\n\n\n### SENDING AND RECEIVING:\n\n  #### yodel.listen()\n\n    returns messages sent to your robot.\n    actual receiving is being taken care of by another thread so yodel.listen is non blocking.\n\n  #### yodel.send(bytearray/int/string, name=str, group = str)\n\n    send data defined by first parameter to a robot with a given name and/or who is a member group\n\n    examples:\n    yodel.send(\"Hello Yodler\", name=\"Yodler\")\n    yodel.send(\"Hello group of Yodlers\", group=\"Yodlers\")\n    yodel.send(\"Hello Yodler who is a member of the the group of yodlers\", name=\"Yodler\", group=\"Yodlers\")\n### MESH NETWORKING:\n\n  #### yodel.enableRelay(bool)\n\n    enable or disable mesh networking.\n    True: mesh networking is enabled\n    False: mesh networking is disabled\n    mesh networking is disabled by default.\n\n\n### GROUP MANAGEMENT:\n\n  #### yodel.addGroup(str)\n\n    Add robot to new group defined by str\n\n  #### yodel.deleteGroup(str)\n\n    Leave group defined by str\n\n  #### yodel.getGroups()\n\n    Get a list containing all groups the robot is a member of\n\n  #### yodel.clearGroups()\n\n    Leave all groups\n\n\n### GENERAL:\n\n  #### yodel.setRepeats(int)\n\n    set retransmission count\n\n  #### yodel.setName(str)\n\n    set robot name used when receiving messages\n\n  #### yodel.getName()\n\n    returns the current name\n\n# Example Code\n\n## Sender\n``` python\nimport yodel\nfrom time import sleep\n\nyodel.startRadio(\"wlx00c0caa5efb2\") #initiate radio on interface wlx00c0caa5efb2 (the interface name will differ on your system)\n\nwhile True:\n\n    yodel.send(\"this is a message\", name=\"listener\",group=\"group_of_robots\") #send data to robots named \"listener\" who are a member of group_of_robots\n    sleep(0.1) #sleep for .1 seconds(this is also just here as a convenience)\n\n```\n\n\n## Receiver\n``` python\n\n\nimport yodel\nfrom time import sleep\n\nyodel.startRadio(\"wlx00c0caa5efb2\") #initiate radio on interface wlx00c0caa5efb2 (the interface name will differ on your system)\nyodel.setName(\"listener\")  #set the robot's name to listener\nyodel.addGroup(\"group_of_robots\")  #add robot to the group \"group_of_robots\"\n\n\nwhile True:\n\n    sleep(0.1) #sleep for .1 seconds, this is just a convenience\n    data = yodel.listen() #listen for all data sent to robots named \"listener\" and/or who are a member of \"group_of_robots\"\n    if data: \n        print(data.payload) #if data is found print it\n\n\n\n\n\n",
