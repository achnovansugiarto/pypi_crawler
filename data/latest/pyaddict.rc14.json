It implements many useful features such as optional chaining, schema validation, type casting, safe indexing and default values.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\npip install pyaddict\n```\n\n## Usage\n```python\nfrom pyaddict import JDict, JList\nfrom pyaddict.schema import Object, String, Integer, Array\n\njdict = JDict({\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"cars\": [\n        {\"model\": \"BMW 230\", \"mpg\": 27.5},\n        {\"model\": \"Ford Edge\", \"mpg\": 24.1}\n    ]\n})\n\n# dicts\nprint(jdict.ensure(\"name\", str))  # John\nprint(jdict.ensure(\"age\", int))  # 30\nprint(jdict.ensure(\"age\", str))  # \"\"\nprint(jdict.ensureCast(\"age\", str))  # \"30\"\nprint(jdict.optionalGet(\"age\", str)) # None\nprint(jdict.optionalCast(\"age\", str))  # \"30\"\nprint(jdict.optionalGet(\"gender\", str)) # None\nprint(jdict.optionalCast(\"gender\", str)) # None\nprint(jdict.ensure(\"gender\", str)) # \"\"\n\n# lists\ncars = jdict.ensureCast(\"cars\", JList)\nprint(cars.assertGet(1, dict))  # {'model': 'Ford Edge', 'mpg': 24.1}\nprint(cars.assertGet(2, dict))  # AssertionError\n\n# iterators\nfor car in cars.iterator().ensureCast(JDict):\n    print(car.ensureCast(\"model\", str)) # BMW 230, Ford Edge\n\n# chaining\nchain = jdict.chain()\nprint(chain.ensureCast(\"cars[1].mpg\", str))  # \"24.1\"\nprint(chain.ensureCast(\"cars[2].mpg\", str))  # \"\"\n# or via direct access (returns Optional[Any]!)\nprint(chain[\"cars[2].mpg\"])  # IndexError\nprint(chain[\"cars[2]?.mpg\"])  # None\n\n# schema validation\nschema = Object({\n    \"name\": String(),\n    \"age\": String().coerce(),\n    \"dogs\": Array(String()).min(1).optional()\n}).withAdditionalProperties()\nprint(schema.error(dict)) # None\n\nbadSchema = Object({\n    \"name\": String().min(5),\n    \"age\": Float(),\n    \"cars\": Object()\n})\nprint(badSchema.error(dict)) # ValidationError(expected 4 to be greater than or equal to 5, name: min)\n```\n\nThe library is fully typed and thus can be used with mypy & pylint. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/dxstiny/pyaddict/wiki) for more information.\n\n## When to use\nWhen working with json data, it is common to have to deal with missing keys, wrong types, etc. This library provides a simple way to deal with these issues. Additionally, it provides easy-to-use typing support for mypy and pylint and detailed documentation.\nStarting with version 1.0.0, pyaddict includes a schema validation feature inspired by [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). It is especially useful when validating user input, e.g. in web applications.\n\n## License\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n## Author\n[dxstiny](https://github.com/dxstiny)\n",

License Grants and Conditions --------------------------------  2.1. Grants  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.  2.2. Effective Date  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

Versions of the License ---------------------------  10.1. New Versions  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.
