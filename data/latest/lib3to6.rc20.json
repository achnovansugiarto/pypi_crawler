Nonetheless, for development it is a\ngood idea to use the newest interpreter you can and ideally you can\nuse the newer type annotation features to type-check your code, but\nellide these annotations in the distribution, since they are not\nneeded at runtime.\n\nIf your existing project uses Python2.7, it may not be possible to\ndedicate a substantial block of time to update all of your code and\nthen flip a switch to start running on Python3. To make matters worse,\nyou may continue to write code only for Python2.7, since that is what\nyour production code will actually run on. With `lib3to6` you can\nstart to use Python3 for development and integration (ensuring forward\ncompatibility) and still maintain backward compatibility while you\nhave to deploy for Python2.\n\n\n## Python Versions and Compatibility\n\nThe compiled output is tested using:\n\n- Python 3.9\n- Python 3.8\n- Python 3.7\n- Python 3.6\n- Python 3.5\n- Python 2.7\n- PyPy 3.6\n- PyPy 3.5\n\nThe test-suite for the transpiler is run using:\n\n- Python 3.9\n- Python 3.8\n- Python 3.7\n- Python 3.6\n- PyPy 3.6\n\nThe compiled output may work with other versions of python, such as `<=2.6` or `>=3.0 <=3.4`, but these are not tested.\n\n\n## Usage Caveats\n\n`lib3to6` does not add any runtime dependencies of its own, but it does inject code, such as temporary variables and imports from the standard library (`itertools` and `builtins` in particular). Any changes will only add a constant `O(1)` overhead.\n\n`lib3to6` does optimistic ast transformations, with the assumption that you're not doing anything too crazy in your code. An example of such a transformation is the support for [PEP3102 - Keyword-Only Arguments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/). `lib3to6` will change the function signature to use `**kwargs` and add locals extracted from `kwargs`.\n\n```\n$ cat kwonly_args_demo.py\ndef compare(a, b, *, key=None):\n    ...\n```\n\n```\n$ lib3to6 kwonly_args_demo.py\ndef compare(a, b, **kwargs):\n    key = kwargs.get('key', None)\n    pass\n```\n\nThis means that the function signature you can get using the `inspect` module may not be what you expect for the output of `lib3to6`.\n\n\n## Per-File Opt-In/Opt-Out\n\nSince `lib3to6==v202008.1042` there is support to selectively enable/disable transpilation on a per-file basis.\n\nAny file which starts with a `# lib3to6: disabled` comment, will not be transpiled. For these, you will have to take care of forward/backward compatibility yourself.\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# lib3to6: disabled\n\"\"\"A module written to work both with Python2 and 3.\n\nThis module doesn't need to be transpiled by lib3to6.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n...\n\nimport sys\n\nPY3 = sys.version_info[0] > 2\n\nif PY3:\n    ...\nelse:\n    ...\n```\n\nInstead of opt-out, you can also take an opt-in approach. You will have to switch the `default_mode` argument:\n\n```python\n# setup.py\npackage_dir = {\"\": \"src\"}\n\nif any(arg.startswith(\"bdist\") for arg in sys.argv):\n    import lib3to6\n    package_dir = lib3to6.fix(package_dir, default_mode='disabled')\n```\n\nThis will leave all files untouched, except for those marked with a `# lib3to6: enabled` comment.\n\n```python\n# lib3to6: enabled\n\"\"\"A module written to work both with Python2 and 3.\n\nThis module doesn't need to be transpiled by lib3to6.\n\"\"\"\n\nname: str = \"Wörld\"\nprint(f\"Hello {world}!\")\n```\n\n\n## Integration using `setup.py`\n\nThe cli command `lib3to6 <filename>` is nice for demo purposes, but for integration with your project, you may prefer to use it in your `setup.py` file. Contributions for other kinds of integration are most welcome.\n\n```python\n# setup.py\n\nimport sys\nimport setuptools\n\npackages = setuptools.find_packages(\".\")\npackage_dir = {\"\": \".\"}\n\ninstall_requires = ['typing;python_version<\"3.5\"']\n\nif any(arg.startswith(\"bdist\") for arg in sys.argv):\n    import lib3to6\n    package_dir = lib3to6.fix(\n        package_dir,\n        target_version=\"2.7\",\n        install_requires=install_requires,\n        default_mode='enabled',\n    )\n\nsetuptools.setup(\n    name=\"my-module\",\n    version=\"0.1.0\",\n    packages=packages,\n    package_dir=package_dir,\n    install_requires=install_requires,\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Programming Language :: Python\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 2\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n        ...\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nWhen you build you package, the contents of the resulting distribution\nwill be the code that was converted by lib3to6.\n\n\n```bash\n~/my-module $ python setup.py bdist_wheel --python-tag=py2.py3\nrunning bdist_wheel\n...\n~/my-module$ ls -1 dist/\nmy_module-201808.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\n\n~/my-module$ python3 -m pip install dist/my_module-201808.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nProcessing ./dist/my_module-201808.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: my-module\nSuccessfully installed my-module-201808.1\n\n~/my-module$ python2 -m pip install dist/my_module-201808.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nProcessing ./dist/my_module-201808.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: my-module\nSuccessfully installed my-module-201808.1\n```\n\nWhen testing, make sure you're not importing `my_module` from your local\ndirectory, which is probably the original source code. Instead you can\neither manipulate your `PYTHONPATH`, or simply switch directories...\n\n```bash\n~/$ python3 -c \"import my_module\"\n/home/user/my-module/my_module/__init__.py\nHello 世界 from 3.6.5!\n\n~/my-module$ cd ..\n~/$ python3 -c \"import my_module\"\n/home/user/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/my_module/__init__.py\nHello 世界 from 3.6.5!\n\n~$ python2 -c \"import my_module\"\n/home/user/envs/py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/my_module/__init__.py\nHello 世界 from 2.7.15!\n```\n\n\n## Automatic Conversions\n\nNot all new language features have a semantic equivalent in older\nversions. To the extent these can be detected, an error will be\nreported when these features are used.\n\nNote that a fix is not applied if the lowest version of python that\nyou are targeting already supports the newer syntax. The conversions\nare ordered by when the feature was introduced.\n\n\n### PEP 572: Assignment Expressions (aka. the walrus operator)\n\n```python\n# Since 3.8\nif match1 := pattern1.match(data):\n    result = match1.group(1)\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.7\nmatch1 = pattern1.match(data)\nif match1:\n    result = match1.group(1)\n```\n\nSome expressions nested expressions in a condition are not so easy,\nin which case lib3to6 will bend over backwards.\n\n```python\n# Since 3.8\nwhile (block := f.read(4096)) != '':\n    process(block)\n\n# For [2.7 - 3.7]\n__loop_condition = True\nwhile __loop_condition:\n    block = f.read(4096)\n    __loop_condition = block != ''\n    if __loop_condition:\n        process(block)\n```\n\n\n### PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Annotations\n\n```python\n# Since 3.7\nclass SelfRef:\n    def method(self) -> SelfRef:\n        pass\n\n# From 3.0 to 3.6\nclass SelfRef:\n    def method(self) -> 'SelfRef':\n        pass\n```\n\nNote that this is not a stupid conversion that is applied to all\nannotations, it is only applied to annotations that are forward\nreferences. Backward references are left as is.\n\n\n```python\n# Since 3.7\nclass BackRef:\n    def method(self) -> ForwardRef:\n        pass\n\nclass ForwardRef:\n    def method(self) -> BackRef:\n        pass\n\n\n# From 3.0 to 3.6\nclass BackRef:\n    def method(self) -> 'ForwardRef':\n        pass\n\nclass ForwardRef:\n    def method(self) -> BackRef:\n        pass\n```\n\nIf you're supporting python 2.7, the annotation will of course be elided.\n\n\n### PEP 498: formatted string literals.\n\n```python\n# Since 3.6\nwho = \"World\"\nprint(f\"Hello {who}!\")\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.5\nwho = \"World\"\nprint(\"Hello {0}!\".format(who))\n```\n\nThe fixer also converts the newer `{var=}` syntax, even if you use\nlib3to6 on a Python version older than 3.8.\n\n```python\n# Since 3.6\nwho = \"World\"\nprint(f\"Hello {who=}!\")\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.5\nprint(\"Hello who={0}!\".format(who))\n```\n\n\n### Eliding of Annotations\n\n```python\n# Since 3.0\ndef foo(bar: int) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# In 2.7\ndef foo(bar):\n    pass\n```\n\n\n### PEP 515: underscores in numeric literals\n\n```python\n# Since 3.6\nnum = 1_234_567\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.5\nnum = 1234567\n```\n\n\n### Unpacking generalizations\n\nFor literals...\n\n```python\n# Since 3.4\nx = [*[1, 2], 3]\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.3\nx = [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nFor varargs...\n\n```python\n# Since 3.4\nfoo(0, *a, *b)\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.3\nfoo(*([0] + list(a) + list(b))\n```\n\nFor kwargs...\n\n```python\n# Since 3.4\nfoo(**x, y=22, **z)\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.3\nimport itertools\nfoo(**dict(itertools.chain(x.items(), {'y': 22}.items(), z.items())))\n```\n\nNote that the import will only be added to your module once.\n\n\n### Keyword only arguments\n\n\n```python\n# Since 3.6\ndef kwonly_func(*, kwonly_arg=1):\n    ...\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.5\ndef kwonly_func(**kwargs):\n    kwonly_arg = kwargs.get('kwonly_arg', 1)\n    ...\n```\n\n\n### Convert class based typing.NamedTuple usage to assignments\n\n\n```python\nimport typing\n\n# Since 3.5\nclass Bar(typing.NamedTuple):\n    x: int\n    y: str\n\n# From 2.7 to 3.4\nBar = typing.NamedTuple('Bar', [('x', int), ('y', str)])\n```\n\n\n### New Style Classes\n\n```python\n# Since 3.0\nclass Bar:\n  pass\n\n# Before 3.0\nclass Bar(object):\n  pass\n```\n\n\n### Future Imports\n\nAll `__future__` imports applicable to your target version are\nprepended to every file.\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# This file is part of the <X> project\n# ...\n\"\"\"A docstring.\"\"\"\n\nx = True\n```\n\nWith `target-version=27` (the default).\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# This file is part of the <X> project\n# ...\n\"\"\"A docstring.\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom __future__ import division\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\n\nx = True\n```\n\nWith `target-version=3.7`\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# This file is part of the <X> project\n# ...\n\"\"\"A docstring.\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nx = True\n```\n\nNote that `lib3to6` works mostly at the ast level, but an exception is\nmade for any comments that appear at the top of the file. These are\npreserved as is, so your shebang, file encoding and licensing headers\nwill be preserved.\n\n\n### Not Supported Features\n\nAn (obviously non-exhaustive) list of features which are **not\nsupported**, either because they involve a semantic change, or\nbecause there is no simple ast transformation to make them work\nacross different python versions:\n\n - PEP 492 - `async`/`await`\n - PEP 465 - `@`/`__matmul__` operator\n - PEP 380 - `yield from` syntax\n - PEP 584 - union operators for `dict`\n - ordered dictionary (since python 3.6)\n\n\n### Modules with Backports\n\nSome new modules have backports, which lib3to6 will point to:\n\n - typing\n - pathlib -> pathlib2\n - secrets -> python2-secrets\n - ipaddress -> py2-ipaddress\n - csv -> backports.csv\n - lzma -> backports.lzma\n - enum -> enum34\n\nFor a full list of modules for which these warnings and errors apply,\nplease review [`MAYBE_UNUSABLE_MODULES` in\nsrc/lib3to6/checkers_backports.py](https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/blob/master/src/lib3to6/checkers_backports.py)\n\nFor some modules, the backport uses the same module name as the original\nmodule in the standard library. By default, lib3to6 will only warn about\nusage of such modules, since it cannot detect if you're using the module\nfrom the backported package (good) or from the standard library (bad if\nnot available in your target version). If you would like to opt-in to hard\nerror messages, you can whitelist modules for which you have the\nbackported package as a dependency.\n\nA good approach to adding such backports as dependencies is to\nqualify the requirement with a [dependency\nspecification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/), so that\nusers with a newer interpreter use the builtin module and don't\ninstall the backport package that they don't need.\n\nThese work as arguments for `install_requires` and also in\n`requirements.txt` files.\n\n```python\nimport setuptools\n\nsetuptools.setup(\n    name=\"my-package\",\n    install_requires=['typing;python_version<\"3.5\"'],\n    ...\n)\n```\n\nFor testing, you can also pass these as a space separated parameter\nto the `lib3to6` cli command:\n\n```shell\n$ lib3to6 my_script.py > /dev/null\nWARNING - my_script.py@1: Use of import 'enum'.\n    This module is only available since Python 3.5,\n    but you configured target_version=2.7.\nWARNING - my_script.py@2: Use of import 'typing'.\n    This module is only available since Python 3.5,\n    but you configured target_version=2.7.\n\nimport enum\nimport typing\n...\n\n$ lib3to6 `--install-requires='typing'` my_script.py > /dev/null\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  ...\n  File \"/home/user/.../lib3to6/src/lib3to6/checkers_backports.py\", line 134, in __call__\n    raise common.CheckError(errmsg, node)\nlib3to6.common.CheckError: my_script.py@1 - Prohibited import 'enum'.\n    This module is available since Python 3.4,\n    but you configured target_version='2.7'.\n    Use 'https://pypi.org/project/enum34' instead.\n\n$ lib3to6 `--install-requires='typing enum34'` my_script.py\nimport enum\nimport typing\n...\n```\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe main motivation for this project is to be able to use `mypy`\nwithout sacrificing compatibility to older versions of python.\n\n```python\n# my_module/__init__.py\ndef hello(who: str) -> None:\n    import sys\n    print(f\"Hello {who} from {sys.version.split()[0]}!\")\n\n\nprint(__file__)\nhello(\"世界\")\n```\n\n\n```bash\n$ pip install lib3to6\n$ python -m lib3to6 my_module/__init__.py\n```\n\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom __future__ import division\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\n\n\ndef hello(who):\n    import sys\n    print('Hello {0} from {1}!'.format(who, sys.version.split()[0]))\n\n\nprint(__file__)\nhello('世界')\n```\n\n\nFixes are applied to match the semantics of python3 code as\nclose as possible, even when running on a python2.7 interpreter.\n\nSome fixes that have been applied in the above:\n\n    - PEP263 magic comment to declare the coding of the python\n      source file. This allows the string literal `\"世界\"` to\n      be decoded correctly.\n    - `__future__` imports have been added. This includes the well\n      known print statement -> function change. The unicode_literals\n    - Type annotations have been removed\n    - `f\"\"` string -> `\"\".format()` conversion\n\n\n### Compatibility Matters\n\nI've seen a common gut reaction to lib3to6, which is that we shouldn't care about older versions of Python, Python 2.7 in particular. I would humbly suggest you consider the position of people other than developers who have full control over their development environment and only use CPython. As of this writing (August 2020), the most recent language version supported by alternative interpreters is the following:\n\n| Interpreter | Version |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Stackless   |     3.7 |\n| PyPy        |     3.6 |\n| MicroPython |     3.4 |\n| IronPython  |     2.7 |\n| Jython      |     2.7 |\n\nNotice that even Stackless Python, which has the least effort to keep up with new language features, is nonetheless lagging behind CPython. And even if all you care about is CPython, be aware that the most recent interpreter may not be available on platforms that users care about. For example on PythonAnywhere.com, the most recent version of CPython is 3.5 and of PyPy is 2.7.\n\nIf you are writing a library and it doesn't **need** any of the newer **runtime** features, such as async/await or ordered dictionaries, then I would humbly suggest you do not unnecessarily prevent users of such platforms from using your library.\n\nFrom a users perspective, only supporting the newest versions of Python might be interpreted as arrogance, but your time as a maintainer isn't free, and you don't owe users of your library anything. Lib3to6 exists to minimize your effort to maintain backward compatibility. If you have difficulties integrating lib3to6 into your packaging process, please report an issue: [gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/-/issues](https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/-/issues).\n\n\n### On Testing your Project\n\nProjects that use lib3to6 should have a test-suite that is executed\nwith the oldest python version that you want to support, using the\nconverted output generated by lib3to6. While you can develop using a\nnewer version of python, you should not blindly trust lib3to6 as it is\nvery easy to introduce backward incompatible changes if you only test\non the most recent interpreter. The most obvious example is that\nlib3to6 cannot do much to help you if a library produces `bytes` on\nPython 2 but `str` on Python 3.\n\nThe easiest way I have found to test a project, is to create a\ndistribution using `python setup.py bdist_wheel` with the above\nmodifications to the `setup.py`, install it and run the test-suite\nagainst the installed modules.\n\n\n## How it works\n\nThis project works at the level of the python abstract syntax\ntree (AST). The AST is transformed so that is only uses\nconstructs that are also valid in older versions of python. For\nexample it will translate f-strings to normal strings using the\n``str.format`` method.\n\n```python\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.version_info\n'3.6.5'\n>>> import lib3to6\n>>> py3_source = 'f\"Hello {1 + 1}!\"'\n>>> cfg = {\"fixers\": [\"f_string_to_str_format\"]}\n>>> py2_source = lib3to6.transpile_module(cfg, py3_source)\n\n>>> print(py3_source)\nf\"Hello {1 + 1}!\"\n>>> print(py2_source)\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"Hello {0}!\".format(1 + 1)\n```\n\nAt a lower level, this translation is based on detection of the\n`ast.JoinedStr` node, which is translated into and AST that can be\nserialized back into python syntax that will also work on older\nversions.\n\n```python\n>>> print(lib3to6.parsedump_ast(py3_source))\nModule(body=[Expr(value=JoinedStr(values=[\n    Str(s='Hello '),\n    FormattedValue(\n        value=BinOp(left=Num(n=1), op=Add(), right=Num(n=1)),\n        conversion=-1,\n        format_spec=None,\n    ),\n    Str(s='!'),\n]))])\n>>> print(lib3to6.parsedump_ast(py2_source))\nModule(body=[Expr(value=Call(\n    func=Attribute(\n        value=Str(s='Hello {0}!'),\n        attr='format',\n        ctx=Load(),\n    ),\n    args=[BinOp(left=Num(n=1), op=Add(), right=Num(n=1))],\n    keywords=[]\n))])\n```\n\n### Checker Errors\n\nOf course this does not cover every aspect of compatibility.\nChanges in APIs cannot be translated automatically in this way.\n\nAn obvious example, is that there is no way to transpile code\nwhich uses `async` and `await`. In this case, `lib3to6`\nwill simply raise a CheckError. This applies only to your source\ncode though, so if import use a library which uses `async` and\n`await`, everything may look fine until you run your tests\non python 2.7.\n\nA more subtle example is the change in semantics of the builtin\n`open` function.\n\n```bash\n$ cat open_example.py\nwith open(\"myfile.txt\", mode=\"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as fobj:\n    fobj.write(\"Hello Wörld!\")\n$ python2 open_example.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function\n```\n\n\nUsually there are alternative ways to write equivalent code that\nworks on all versions of python. For these common\nincompatibilities lib3to6 will raise an error and suggest an\nalternative, such as in this case using `io.open` instead.\n\n```bash\n$ lib3to6 open_example.py\nTraceback (Most recent call last):\n11  lib3to6      <module>         --> sys.exit(main())\n764 core.py      __call__         --> return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n717 core.py      main             --> rv = self.invoke(ctx)\n956 core.py      invoke           --> return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\n555 core.py      invoke           --> return callback(*args, **kwargs)\n55  __main__.py  main             --> fixed_source_text = transpile.transpile_module(cfg, source_text)\n260 transpile.py transpile_module --> checker(cfg, module_tree)\n158 checkers.py  __call__         --> raise common.CheckError(msg, node)\nCheckError: Prohibited keyword argument 'encoding' to builtin.open. on line 1 of open_example.py\n```\n\n\nHere `lib3to6` you will give you a `CheckError`, however it\nremains your responsibility to write your code so that this\nsyntactic translation is semantically equivalent in both python3\nand python2.\n\n`lib3to6` uses the python `ast` module to parse your code. This\nmeans that you need a modern python interpreter to transpile from\nmodern python to legacy python interpreter. You cannot transpile\nfeatures which your interpreter cannot parse. The intended use is\nfor developers of libraries who use the most modern python\nversion, but want their libraries to work on older versions.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe most basic contribution you can make is to provide minimal,\nreproducible examples of code that should either be converted or\nwhich should raise an error.\n\nThe project is hosted at\n[gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6](https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6),\nmainly because that's where the CI/CD is configured. GitHub is only\nused as a copy/backup (and because that seems to be where many people\nlook for things).\n\nYou can get started with local development in just a few commands.\n\n```shell\nuser@host:~/ $ git clone https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6.git\nuser@host:~/ $ cd lib3to6/\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ make help\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ make conda     # creates conda environments\n...\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ ls ~/miniconda3/envs/\nuser@host:~/lib3to6_pypy35 lib3to6_py27 lib3to6_py36 lib3to6_py37 lib3to6_py38\n```\n\nThe targets in the makefile are set up to use the virtual environments.\n\n```shell\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ make fmt\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\n21 files left unchanged.\n\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ make lint mypy devtest\nisort ... ok\nsjfmt ... ok\nflake8 .. ok\nmypy .... ok\n...\n```\n\nFor debugging you may wish to activate a virtual environment anyway.\n\n\n```shell\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master $ source activate\nuser@host:~/lib3to6/ ⎇master (lib3to6_py38) $ ipython\nPython 3.8.2 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Apr 24 2020, 08:20:52)\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\nIPython 7.14.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.

I've been using this library for over two years on a few projects\nwithout much incident. Examples of such projects are:\n\n- [BumpVer](https://pypi.org/project/bumpver/).\n- [markdown-katex](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-katex/)\n- [markdown-svgbob](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-svgbob/)\n- [markdown-aafigure](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-aafigure/)\n- [pylint-ignore](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-ignore/)\n- [pretty-traceback](https://pypi.org/project/pretty-traceback/)\n- [backports.pampy](https://pypi.org/project/backports.pampy/)\n\n\n## Future Work\n\nIn an ideal world, the project would cover all cases documented on\nhttp://python-future.org and either:\n\n 1. Transpile to code that will work on any version\n 2. Raise an error, ideally pointing to a page and section on\n    python-future.org or other documentation describing\n    alternative methods of writing backwards compatible code.\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.X/whatsnew/ also contains much info on\nAPI changes that might be checked for, but checks and fixers for\nthese will only be written if they are common enough, otherwise\nit's just too much work (patches are welcome though).\n## Alternatives\n\nSince starting this project, I've learned of the\n[py-backwards](https://github.com/nvbn/py-backwards) project, which is\nvery, very similar in its approach. I have not evaluated it yet, to\ndetermine for what projects it might be a better choice.\n\nSome features that might be implemented\n\n- PEP 380 - `yield from gen` syntax might be supported in a basic form\n  by expanding to a `for x in gen: yield x`. That is not semantically\n  equivalent though and I don't know if it's worth\n  [implementing it properly](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#formal-semantics)\n- PEP 465 - `@` operator could be done by replacing all cases\n  where the operator is used with a `__matmul__` method call.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n - Q: Isn't the tagline \"Compatibility Matters\" ironic,\n   considering that python 3.6+ is required to build a wheel?\n - A: The irony is not lost. The issue is, how to parse source\n   code from a newer version of python than the python\n   interpreter itself supports. You can install lib3to6 on\n   older versions of python, but you'll be limited to the\n   features supported by that version. For example, you won't be\n   able to use f\"\" strings on python 3.5, but most annotations\n   will work fine.\n\n - Q: Why keep python2.7 alive? Just let it die already!\n - A: Indeed, and lib3to6 can help with that. Put yourself in the\n   shoes of somebody who is working on an old codebase. It's not\n   realistic hold all other development efforts while the\n   codebase is migrated and tested, while everything else waits.\n\n   Instead an incremental approach is usually the only option.\n   With lib3to6, individual modules of the codebase can be\n   migrated to python3, leaving the rest of the codebase\n   untouched. The project can still run in a python 2.7\n   environment, while developers increasingly move to using\n   python 3.\n\n   Additionally, lib3to6 is not just for compatibility with\n   python 2.7, it also allows you to use new features like f\"\"\n   strings and variable annotations, while still maintaining\n   compatibility with older versions of python 3.\n\n - Q: Why not `lib3to2`?\n - A: I can't honestly say much about `lib3to2`. It seems to not\n   be maintained and looking at the source I thought it would be\n   easier to just write something new that worked on the AST level.\n   The scope of `lib3to6` is more general than 3to2, as you can\n   use it even if all you care about is converting from python 3.6\n   to 3.5.\n\n\n[repo_ref]: https://github.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6\n\n[github_build_img]: https://github.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/workflows/CI/badge.svg\n[github_build_ref]: https://github.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/actions?query=workflow%3ACI\n\n[gitlab_build_img]: https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/badges/master/pipeline.svg\n[gitlab_build_ref]: https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/pipelines\n\n[codecov_img]: https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/badges/master/coverage.svg\n[codecov_ref]: https://mbarkhau.gitlab.io/lib3to6/cov\n\n[license_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg\n[license_ref]: https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n[mypy_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/mypy-checked-green.svg\n[mypy_ref]: https://mbarkhau.gitlab.io/lib3to6/mypycov\n\n[style_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-%20sjfmt-f71.svg\n[style_ref]: https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/straitjacket/\n\n[pypi_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-wheels-green.svg\n[pypi_ref]: https://pypi.org/project/lib3to6/#files\n\n[downloads_img]: https://pepy.tech/badge/lib3to6/month\n[downloads_ref]: https://pepy.tech/project/lib3to6\n\n[version_img]: https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=CalVer&message=v202107.1047&color=blue\n[version_ref]: https://pypi.org/project/bumpver/\n\n[pyversions_img]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/lib3to6.svg\n[pyversions_ref]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lib3to6\n\n\n\n# Changelog for https://github.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6\n\n## v202107.1045\n\n - Fix type annotations with list arguments\n\n\n## v202107.1044\n\n - Fix type annotations with attribute access\n\n\n## v202101.1043\n\n - Fixes for Python 3.9 and mypy 0.800\n\n\n## v202009.1042\n\n - New #6: per-file opt-in/opt-out using `# lib3to6: disabled`/`# lib3to6: enabled`\n\n\n## v202006.1041\n\n - New: Lots more documentation.\n - New #5: Add detection of invalid imports and point to available backports.
