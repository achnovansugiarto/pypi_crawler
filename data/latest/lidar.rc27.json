In traditional\nhydrological modeling, surface depressions in a DEM are commonly treated\nas artifacts and thus filled and removed to create a depressionless DEM,\nwhich can then be used to generate continuous stream networks. In\nreality, however, surface depressions in DEMs are commonly a combination\nof spurious and actual terrain features. Fine-resolution DEMs derived\nfrom Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can capture and represent\nactual surface depressions, especially in glaciated and karst\nlandscapes. During the past decades, various algorithms have been\ndeveloped to identify and delineate surface depressions, such as\ndepression filling, depression breaching, hybrid breaching-filling, and\ncontour tree method. More recently, a level-set method based on graph\ntheory was proposed to delineate the nested hierarchy of surface\ndepressions. The **lidar** Python package implements the level-set\nmethod and makes it possible for delineating the nested hierarchy of\nsurface depressions as well as elevated terrain features. It also\nprovides an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users\nto run the program with minimal coding.\n\n## Statement of Need\n\nThe **lidar** package is intended for scientists and researchers who\nwould like to integrate surface depressions into hydrological modeling.\nIt can also facilitate the identification and delineation of\ndepressional features, such as sinkholes, detention basins, and prairie\npotholes. The detailed topological and geometric properties of surface\ndepressions can be useful for terrain analysis and hydrological\nmodeling, including the size, volume, mean depth, maximum depth, lowest\nelevation, spill elevation, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis\nlength, elongatedness.\n\n## State of the Field\n\nCurrently, there are a few open-source Python packages that can perform depression filling on digital elevation data, such as [RichDEM](https://richdem.readthedocs.io/) and [whitebox](https://github.com/giswqs/whitebox-python), the Python frontend for [WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools). However, there are no Python packages offering tools for delineating the nested hierarchy of surface depressions and catchments as well as simulating inundation dynamics. The **lidar** Python package is intended for filling this gap.\n\n## Key Features\n\n-   Smoothing DEMs using mean, median, and Gaussian filters.\n-   Extracting depressions from DEMs.\n-   Filtering out small artifact depressions based on user-specified minimum depression size.\n-   Generating refined DEMs with small depressions filled but larger depressions kept intact.\n-   Delineating depression nested hierarchy using the level-set method.\n-   Delineating mount nested hierarchy using the level-set method.\n-   Computing topological and geometric properties of depressions, including size, volume, mean depth, maximum depth, lowest elevation,\n    spill elevation, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, elongatedness, eccentricity, orientation, and area-bbox-ratio.\n-   Exporting depression properties as a csv file.\n\n## Installation\n\n**lidar** supports a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows,\nmacOS, and Linux operating systems. Note that you will need to have\n**Python 3.x** (&lt; 3.9) installed. Python 2.x is not supported.\n**lidar** is available on both [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lidar) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lidar).\nlidar has a [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) dependency, which can be challenging to install using pip on Windows.\nTherefore, it is highly recommended to install lidar from the conda-forge channel.\nIf you encounter any errors, please check the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below.\n\n### Install from PyPI\n\nTo install **lidar** from PyPI, run this command in your terminal:\n\n```console\npip install lidar\n```\n\n### Install from conda-forage\n\nIf you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\ninstalled on your computer, you can create a fresh conda environment to install lidar:\n\n```console\nconda create -n py38 python=3.8\nconda activate py38\nconda install lidar -c conda-forge\n```\n\n### Upgrade lidar\n\nIf you have installed lidar before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```console\npip install -U lidar\n```\n\nIf you use conda, you can update lidar to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```console\nconda update lidar -c conda-forge\n```\n\nTo install the development version from GitHub directly using Git, run the following code:\n\n```console\npip install git+https://github.com/giswqs/lidar\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nlidar's Python dependencies are listed in its [requirements.txt](https://github.com/giswqs/lidar/blob/master/requirements.txt) file. In\naddition, lidar has a C library dependency: GDAL &gt;=1.11.2. How to\ninstall GDAL in different operating systems will be explained below.\nMore information about GDAL can be found [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).\n\n#### Linux\n\n##### Debian-based Linux\n\nThe following commands can be used to install GDAL for Debian-based\nLinux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint).\n\n```console\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev\n```\n\nIf you encounter any compiling errors, try the following commands.\n\n```console\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential\nsudo apt-get install python3-dev\npip install wheel\n```\n\n##### Pacman-based Linux\n\nThe following commands can be used to install GDAL for Pacman-based\nLinux distributions (e.g., Arch Linux, Manjaro). You might need to use\n**sudo** if you encounter permission errors.\n\n```console\nsudo pacman -S yaourt --noconfirm\nyaourt -S gdal --noconfirm\nyaourt -S python-gdal --noconfirm\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\nFor a Homebrew based Python environment, do the following.\n\n```console\nbrew update\nbrew install gdal\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install GDAL binaries from [kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete). You will\nthen need to add the installed location\n`/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs` to your system path.\n\n#### Windows\n\nThe instruction below assumes that you have installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Open\n**Anaconda Prompt** and enter the following commands to create a conda\nenvironment and install required packages\n\n```console\nconda create -n py38 python=3.8\nconda activate py38\nconda install lidar -c conda-forge\n```\n\nWhen installing the **lidar** package, if you encounter an error\nsaying `Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required`, please follow the steps\nbelow to fix the error and reinstall **lidar**. More information can\nbe found at this link [Fix Python 3 on Windows error - Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required](https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c++-14-required/).\n\n-   Download [Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15)\n-   Double click to install the downloaded installer - **Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017**.\n-   Open **Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017**\n-   Select **Workloads --> Visual C++ build tools** and click the install button\n\n## Usage\n\nLaunch the interactive notebook tutorial for the **lidar** Python\npackage with **Google Colab** now:\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giswqs/lidar/blob/master/examples/lidar_colab.ipynb)\n\n### A quick example\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pkg_resources\nfrom lidar import *\n\n# identify the sample data directory of the package\npackage_name = 'lidar'\ndata_dir = pkg_resources.resource_filename(package_name, 'data/')\n\n# use the sample dem.
