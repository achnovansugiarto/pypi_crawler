    "description": "# uAPI - A micropython API framework\n\nThis project is meant to make programming APIs on micropython supported microcontrollers easier. The general design is inspired by [tiangolo/fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), one of my favorite python frameworks which I personally use a lot.\n\nIf you have any questions, it is recommended to check the [examples directory](/examples) first.\n\n## Usage\n\nGenerally there are two possibilities to use this framework in your project:\n\n- **prebuild (recommended):** You can go to the releases page and check for the latest .mpy file. You can simply add this file on your controller and it will be used just as the sourcecode itself.\n- **source code:** You can also add the entire `uAPI/` subdirectory on your controller and develop with it as with any other local module. This is only recommended if you want to experiment on something or contribute to the project.\n\n## Features\n\n- Safe typing for headers\n\n## Building\n\nThe two sections below describe how to build the framework either manually or with Docker.\n\n### Manually\n\nFirst of all make sure you have the latest version of the mpy-cross, the open source micropython cross compiler. For that visit the offical [micropython github page](https://github.com/micropython/micropython).\n\nThen you can simple aggregate all the python files in the `uAPI/` subdirectory to a single `uAPI.py` file which will be stored in `build/`, using the provided script `create_single_file.py`.\n\nThis file can already be used as your module. It is recommended to use the precompiled version though, reducing the space and also the runtime. Therefore simply use the mpy-cross command after merging the files:\n```bash\nmpy-cross -O[3] ./build/uAPI.py\n```\n\n`-O[3]` will indicate mpy-cross to use the highest level of compression, read more about these in the mpy-cross documentation.\n\n### Docker(-Compose)\nTo build using the docker compose simply use, (don't forget to add `--build` if running the first time):\n```bash\ndocker-compose up uapi-build\n```\n\nIf you do not want to run with docker-compose but still want to use docker, you can do so by mounting the directories into the image on run:\n```\ndocker build . -t uapi-build\ndocker run \\\n    -v $(pwd)/uAPI:/uAPI \\\n    -v $(pwd)/build:/build \\\n    uapi-build\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to this project!\n\n### Compiling and Testing\nTo validate whether your changes would compile you can call the [micropython unix port](https://github.com/micropython/micropython#the-unix-version) from the offical repository.\n\nYou can check your compile by:\n```\nmicropython -X compile-only <your changed file>\n```\n\n#### TODO TESTING\n\n### Formatting\nWe use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to check our formatting, to use it you can simply install it by (you may need an sudo install to get it as an recognized command in your shell):\n```\n(sudo) pip3 install black\n```\n\nYou can simply use it as `black .` to automatically format the whole project or with the `--check --diff` flags to see if black would require you to do any changes without actually writing on your files.\n\n\n### Hooks\nYou should setup a pre-commit hook on your machine, that handles the format and syntax checks automatically and helps you to keep your worktree clean. Note that not well formatted code (and of course unfunctional one) will not be accepted to the codebase.\n```\ngit config --local core.hooksPath ./.githooks/\n```\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.",
