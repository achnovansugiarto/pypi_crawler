To free up space and remove it again use the following command:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\npip uninstall en_core_web_trf\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n\r\nStart the program using the command line:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\naliasify\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternativelly (e.g. in an environment with blocked executables) start the program from a python session:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport aliasify\r\naliasify.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the program has started, you can use the following workflow:\r\n\r\n- Copy a text into your clipboard.\r\n- Press F9 to replace all entities in the text with placeholders.\r\n- Use the text in chatGPT, e.g. ask ChatGPT to shorten it.\r\n- Copy the response into your clipboard.\r\n- Press F10 to restore the orginal entities in the modified text.\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n\r\nCopy the following text:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nSubject: Invitation to attend the International Conference on Climate Change\r\n\r\nDear Dr. James Smith,\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Maria Perez, and I am writing to invite you to the International Conference on Climate Change, which will be held in Geneva, Switzerland from May 1-4, 2023.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed your research on climate change and the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, and believe that your insights and expertise would make a valuable contribution to our conference. We are particularly interested in your recent paper on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, which was published in the Journal of Environmental Science last year.\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together leading experts, scientists, and policymakers from around the world to discuss the latest research and innovations in the field of climate change. This year's theme is \"Innovative Solutions for a Sustainable Future\", and we believe that your research aligns well with this focus.\r\n\r\nIn addition to presenting your research, you will have the opportunity to network with other experts in your field, attend panel discussions, and participate in workshops. The conference will also feature a keynote address from Dr. Rajesh Sharma, the director of the Climate Change Division at the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWe would be delighted if you could join us in Geneva for this important event. Please let us know if you are able to attend, and we will provide you with further details and instructions for registration.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMaria Perez\r\n\r\nConference Coordinator\r\n\r\nInternational Conference on Climate Change\r\n\r\nGeneva, Switzerland\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, with the running aliasify program, press F9 and paste the text into chatGPT:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nSubject: Invitation to attend <<EVENT_000018>>\r\n\r\nDear Dr. <<PERSON_000019>>,\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well.
