Currently, *r-lint* is assuming the following project structure:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            .\n            ├── data\n            │   └── input_data   // A collection of input data\n            |   └── ...\n            ├── Dockerfile       // Docker container recipe\n            ├── environment.yml  // Conda environment recipe\n            └── scripts\n                └── example.R    // A collection of R scripts\n                └── ...\n        \n        Start the linting of a project directoy with:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ r-lint lint /path/to/project\n         \n        The linting will report warnings and failures by default. **Failure** events are recorded, if you did not provide:\n        \n        - A file named ``Dockerfile``, the receipe for the Docker container \n        - A file named ``environment.yml``, the **Conda configuration file**\n        \n        There a **warnings** raised, if you did not provide:\n        \n        - A folder named ``data``, with the input data for the R analysis\n        - A folder named ``scripts``, with the R scripts themselves\n        \n        Dockerfile \n            For the ``Dockerfile`` some things are mandatory, like:\n                \n            - ``LABEL name`` - The name of the container. Needs to match the regex ``(Q|q)[a-zA-Z0-9]{4}-ranalysis``, for example **qtest-ranalysis**\n            - ``LABEL maintainer`` - The name of the container maintainer with email, for example **Sven Fillinger <sven.fillinger@qbic.uni-tuebingen.de>**\n            - ``LABEL version`` - The 3-digit numeric version string following the `semantic version standard`__\n            - ``LABEL organization`` - The organization's name\n            - ``LABEL github`` - The link to the GitHub repository\n        \n        __ semantic_\n        .. _semantic: https://semver.org/\n        \n        \n        The subcommand <build>\n        ----------------------\n        \n        The subcommand ``build`` is a small helper tool, that is able to parse ``sessionInfo`` output from R and extracts the package names with versions.\n        \n        It then takes these and checks on `Anaconda cloud`__ if these are available in one of the pre-defined channels `[default, r, bioconda]`. If successful, it will automatically add the corresponding conda package with version in the `environment.yml`. If a package cannot be found, a warning is printed on the command-line. If a specified version of a package is not found, it prints the available versions on the command-line.\n        \n        To start the build, be sure you have an active internet connection and run it with:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n            \n            $ r-lint build <R package list> environment.yml\n        \n        The ``R package list`` can be obtained from inside your active R session, that was used to run your R analysis successfully. From within your R console, just type:\n        \n        .. code-block:: R\n        \n            > sessionInfo()$otherPkgs\n            \n        This is your R package list, which is needed for r-lint build to work properly.\n        \n        __ anaconda_\n        .. _anaconda: https://anaconda.org/\n        \nKeywords: R,linting,lint,Docker,container\nPlatform: UNKNOWN\n",
