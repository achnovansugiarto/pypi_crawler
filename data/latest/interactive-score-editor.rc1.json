    "description": "# Interactive Score Editor\nA python library that combines score editing tools with audio output.<br>\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Status%22)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=Y3YYB6AYD1)](https://codecov.io/gh/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor)\n![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-brightgreen)\n![image](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor)\n\n## Overview\n\nInteractive Score Editor is a python library that helps bridge a music notation library (such as Lilypond via Abjad(https://abjad.github.io/index.html) to an audio player (such as pydub). The goal is to resolve the following: \"Abjad provides no audio output beyond LilyPondâ€™s built-in MIDI functionality\" (https://abjad.github.io/first_steps/audience.html). Using LilyPond's MIDI is will take longer and be more complicated than a built in feature to play notes directly.\n\nA successful implementation will be helpful both for individuals creating music-composition tools / applications, as well as individuals looking to play around with music composition and sound in a notebook, and will cut the time from starting a music project to hearing actual sound (an element which has been a personal annoyance).\n\n# Installation\n\nPrerequisites:\n* Python >=3.7,\n* lilypond, portaudio\n* numpy, pyaudio, midiutil, ipython, pygame\n\nTo install python packages:\n```bash\n$ pip install numpy\n$ pip install pyaudio\n$ pip install midiutil\n$ pip install ipython\n$ pip install pygame\n```\n\nLilypond (https://lilypond.org) and portaudio (http://www.portaudio.com) can be installed from their websites, with brew\n```\n$ brew install lilypond\n$ brew install portaudio\n```\nor with apt\n```\n# sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio\n# sudo apt install -y lilypond\n```\n\nEnsure that lilypond runs from the command line by running \n```bash\n$ lilypond --version\n```\n\n# Quick start example\n\nFor now, ensure you have a folder named `temp` in the current directory in order to ensure functinality of getScore() (this will be amended in a future release)\n```python\nimport importlib  \nise = importlib.import_module(\"interactive-score-editor.src.Base\")\nPiece = ise.Piece\np1 = Piece(60, \"3/4\")\np1.addVoice(\"e' f' g'\", 4)\np1.addVoice(\"c'4 d'4 e'4 f'4 g'4 a'4 b'4 c''4 b'4 c''2.\")\np1.play()\np1.getScore()\n```\n\nThe above example demonstrates the primary functionality of the piece object; the ability to play and display notes using the same object.\n\n# Contributions\nSee the guidelines for [Contributing](https://github.com/sadigulcelik/interactive-score-editor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n",
