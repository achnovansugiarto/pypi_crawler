This can be as simple as running::\r\n\r\n$ touch ~/pysemantic.conf\r\n\r\nAfter installing pysemantic, you should have a command line script called\r\n``semantic``. Try it out by running::\r\n\r\n$ semantic list\r\n\r\nThis should do nothing. This means that you don't have any projects regiestered\r\nunder pysemantic. A _project_ in pysemantic is just a collection of _datasets_.\r\npysemantic manages your datasets like an IDE manages source code files in that\r\nit groups them under different projects, and each project has it's own tree\r\nstructure, build toolchains, requirements, etc. Similarly, different\r\npysemantic projects group under them a set of datasets, and manages them\r\ndepending on their respective user-defined specifications. Projects are\r\nuniquely identified by their names.\r\n\r\nFor now, let's add and configure a demo project called, simply,\r\n\"pysemantic_demo\". You can create a project and register it with pysemantic\r\nusing the ``add`` subcommand of the ``semantic`` script as follows::\r\n\r\n$ semantic add pysemantic_demo\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this does not fit the supported usage of the ``add`` subcommand.\r\nWe additionally need a file containing the specifications for this project.\r\n(Note that this file, containing the specifications, is referred to throughout\r\nthe documentation interchangeably as a *specfile* or a *data dictionary*.)\r\nBefore we create this file, let's download the well known Fisher iris datset,\r\nwhich we will use as the sample dataset for this demo. You can download it\r\n`here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motherbox/pysemantic/master/pysemantic/tests/testdata/iris.csv>`_.\r\n\r\nOnce the dataset is downloaded, fire up your favourite text editor and create a\r\nfile named ``demo_specs.yaml``. Fill it up with the following content.\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: yaml\r\n\r\n    iris:\r\n      path: /absolute/path/to/iris.csv\r\n\r\nNow we can use this file as the data dictionary of the ``pysemantic_demo``\r\nproject. Let's tell pysemantic that we want to do so, by running the following\r\ncommand::\r\n\r\n$ semantic add pysemantic_demo /path/to/demo_specs.yaml\r\n\r\nWe're all set. To see how we did, start a Python interpreter and type the\r\nfollowing statements::\r\n\r\n>>> from pysemantic import Project\r\n>>> demo = Project(\"pysemantic_demo\")\r\n>>> iris = demo.load_dataset(\"iris\")\r\n\r\nVoila! The Python object named ``iris`` is actually a pandas DataFrame containing\r\nthe iris dataset! Well, nothing really remarkable so far. In fact, we cloned\r\nand installed a module, wrote two seemingly unnecessary files, and typed three\r\nlines of Python code to do something that could have been achieved by simply\r\nwriting::\r\n\r\n>>> iris = pandas.read_csv(\"/path/to/iris.csv\")\r\n\r\nMost datasets, however, are not as well behaved as this one. In fact they can\r\nbe a nightmare to deal with. Pysemantic can be far more intricate and far\r\nsmarter than this when dealing with mangled, badly encoded, ugly data with\r\ninconsistent data types. Check the IPython notebooks in the examples to see how to use Pysemantic for\r\nsuch data.",
