    "description": "# <center>Mouth-to-Ear Latency Measurement</center>\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this software is to measure the mouth-to-ear (M2E) latency of a \npush-to-talk network. M2E latency characterizes the time between speech input \ninto on communications device and its output through another. M2E latency has \nbeen identified as a key metric of quality of experience (QoE) in communications. \nNIST's PSCR group developed this software to measure and quantify the M2E latency \nof Push To Talk (PTT) devices.\n\n## OBTAINING SOFTWARE\n\n- Mouth-to-ear latency measurement software available at:  https://github.com/usnistgov/mouth2ear\n- MCV QoE GUI software available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe\n- Core MCV QoE library available at : https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base\n\n## MORE INFORMATION\n- Data available at: https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1422492\n- Paper available at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8206\n\n## Hardware Requirements\n* 2 computers able to run Python (only one needed for one location measurements)\n* 2 audio interfaces (only one needed for one location measurements)\n* 2 timecode generators with IRIG-B outputs (not needed for one location measurements)\n* QoE hardware\n* 2 push-to-talk communications devices for testing\n* Cables to connect test devices and timecode generators (if used) to audio interfaces\n\n## Installation and Software\nTo install this package run\n```\npip install mcvqoe-mouth2ear\n```\n\nAlternatively, to install the `mcvqoe-mouth2ear` package, clone this repository and run the \nfollowing from the root of the git repository:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\nThe `mcvqoe-base` package is required for install, it can be found at https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base.\n\nIt is also recommended to install the `mcvqoe` package which has the measurement GUI to make measurements easier and more intuitive to run. It can be found at https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe.\n\n## Mouth-to-Ear 1 Location\n\nTo run the test, simply enter `m2e-measure` in a terminal opened to the top level directory. To learn about the defaults, and various arguments you can add to the test, please run `m2e-measure --help`\n\n### Example\n\n```\nm2e-measure --audio-files testfile.wav --trials 120 --overplay 1.2\n```\n\n* `-a testfile.wav` runs the program with \"testfile.wav\" as the test sound file \n* `--trials 120` runs 120 trials (default is 100)\n* `--overplay 1.2` adds 1.2 seconds of silence after the audio is played (default is 0.1 seconds)\n\n#### Simulation\n\nOne location tests can also be simulated using the `m2e-simulate` entry point.\nFor example, the following is a simulation of the above example :\n\n```\nm2e-simulate --audio-files testfile.wav --trials 120 --overplay 1.2\n```\n\n## Mouth-to-Ear 2 Location\n\n### Transmitter side\nTo run the Tx portion of the test, simply use `m2e-measure --testtype m2e_2loc_tx` in a terminal opened to the top level directory. Please enter `m2e-measure --help` to learn more. Once the side is started, the test will begin imminently, so start the Rx side before the Tx side to make sure that all the data gets captured.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nm2e-measure --testtype m2e_2loc_tx\n```\n\n* `--testtype m2e_2loc_tx` runs the Mouth to Ear 2 location transmitter side test (default is m2e_1loc)\n\n### Receiver side\nTo run the Rx portion of the test, simply use `m2e-measure --testtype m2e_2loc_rx` in a terminal opened to the top level directory. Please enter `m2e-measure --help` to learn more.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nm2e-measure --testtype m2e_2loc_rx\n```\n\n* Press any key on the receiving side to stop the recording when the test finishes on the transmit side.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**Much of the included software was developed by NIST employees for that software the following disclaimer applies:**\n\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
