    "description": "# mapactionpy_controller_dependencies\n This is a pseudo package to force the install of dependencies for [`mapaction_controller`](https://github.com/mapaction/mapactionpy_controller) via pip on Windows, even for those which don't support pip.\n\nThere are a number of third party packages which are bundled here. These are stored in the\nfolder `dependency_wheels` and are included purely to simplify the experience of those installing `mapactionpy_controller` via `pip`. We are grateful for the excellent of these projects and do not claim either copyright or credit for their work. \n\nNor do we claim any endorsement from their authors for `mapactionpy_controller`.\n\nThe wheel files used are sourced from Christoph Gohlke's excellent [\"Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages\"](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). They come with the following disclaimer:\n> \"The files are provided \"as is\" without warranty or support of any kind.
