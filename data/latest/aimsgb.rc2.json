    "description": "Introduction\n============\naimsgb, an efficient and open-source Python library for generating atomic coordinates in periodic grain boundary models. It is designed to\nconstruct various grain boundary structures from cubic and non-cubic initial\nconfigurations. A convenient command line tool has also been provided to enable\neasy and fast construction of tilt and twist boundaries by assigining the degree\nof fit (Σ), rotation axis, grain boundary plane and initial crystal structure.\naimsgb is expected to greatly accelerate the theoretical investigation of\ngrain boundary properties and facilitate the experimental analysis of grain\nboundary structures as well.\n\nA reference for the usage of aimsGB software is:\nJianli Cheng, Jian Luo, and Kesong Yang, Aimsgb: An Algorithm and OPen-Source Python Library to Generate Periodic Grain Boundary Structures, Comput. Mater. Sci. 155, 92-103, (2018). \nDOI:10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.08.029  \n\nInstall aimsgb\n==============\n1. Clone the latest version from github::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:ksyang2013/aimsgb.git\n\n2. Navigate to aimsgb folder::\n\n    cd aimsgb\n\n3. Type in the root of the repo::\n\n    pip install .\n\n4. or to install the package in development mode::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\n\nHow to cite aimsgb\n==================\n\nIf you use aimsgb in your research, please consider citing the following work:\n\n    Jianli Cheng, Jian Luo, Kesong Yang. *Aimsgb: An algorithm and open-source python\n    library to generate periodic grain boundary structures.* Computational Materials\n    Science, 2018, 155, 92-103. `doi:10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.08.029\n    <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.08.029>`_\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\nCopyright (C) 2018 The Regents of the University of California\n\nAll Rights Reserved.
