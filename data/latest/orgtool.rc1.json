    "description": "Orgtool\n        =======\n        \n        `Orgtool` is an extremely flexible organizer platform. It encourages creation\n        of loosely coupled reusable components by combining `Docu`_'s fantastic\n        flexibility with `Tool`_'s signals-driven approach.\n        \n        .. _Docu: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docu\n        .. _Tool: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tool\n        \n        Installation\n        ------------\n        \n            $  pip install orgtool\n        \n        This won't give you a working organizer. Orgtool is a *platform* so you need to\n        create a `Tool`_ project and include Orgtool's extensions as \"bundles\". Each\n        component provides commands, controllers, URL rules and templates (not\n        necessarily all of them). You can easily create almost any kind of organizer\n        (from PIM to a Trac clone) by combining existing components (`orgtool.ext.*`),\n        overriding their templates and writing your own components.\n        \n        Documentation\n        -------------\n        \n        See the `complete documentation`_ for details.\n        \n        .. _complete documentation: http://packages.python.org/orgtool\n        \n        Author\n        ------\n        \n        The original idea was conceived by Andrey Mikhaylenko and Ilia Musabirov in\n        2009. The code has been written by Andrey Mikhaylenko since 2009.\n        \n        See the file AUTHORS for a complete authors list of this application.\n        \n        Please feel free to submit patches, report bugs or request features:\n        \n            http://bitbucket.org/neithere/orgtool/issues/\n        \n        Licensing\n        ---------\n        \n        Orgtool is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published\n        by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n        \n        Orgtool is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
