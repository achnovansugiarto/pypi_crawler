    "description": "asynctb: stack introspection for Python async programming\n=========================================================\n\n``asynctb`` is a library that helps you get tracebacks of parts of your\nrunning Python program. It was originally designed with async tasks in\nmind (thus the name), but also has some support for threads, greenlets,\nand ordinary synchronous code. It is loosely affiliated with the `Trio\n<https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`__ async framework, and shares Trio's\nobsessive focus on usability and correctness. You don't have to use it\nwith Trio, though; its only package dependency is\n`attrs <https://www.attrs.org/>`__.\n\nThis is mostly intended as a building block for other debugging and\nintrospection tools. You can use it directly, but there's only\nrudimentary support for end-user-facing niceties such as\npretty-printed output. On the other hand, the core logic is\nextremely flexible:\n\n* Tracebacks can be extracted for generators (regular and async),\n  coroutine objects, greenlets, threads, and ranges of frame objects.\n\n* Other awaitables can be handled by defining an \"unwrapper\", which\n  takes an awaitable of that type and returns a coroutine or generator.\n  Several are supported out of the box, for async generator ``asend()``\n  and ``athrow()`` methods and ``coroutine_wrapper`` objects.\n  Third-party packages can add more.\n\n* Tracebacks can include information about what context managers are\n  active in each frame, including references to the context manager\n  objects themselves. For example, this can be used to draw a\n  detailed Trio task tree. The logic knows how to look inside\n  ``@contextmanager``, ``ExitStack``, and their async equivalents\n  (both those in the stdlib and their popular backports in\n  ``async_generator`` and ``async_exit_stack``).\n  Third-party packages can define context manager unwrappers too.\n\n* There are a number of customization points allowing third-party\n  packages to specify that some of their functions and/or those\n  functions' callees should be excluded from ``asynctb`` tracebacks,\n  or should incorporate the traceback of another object that\n  ``asynctb`` knows how to handle. For example, the traceback of a\n  Trio task blocked in ``trio.to_thread.run_sync()`` could cover the\n  code that's running in the thread as well.\n\nAnd of course, if you want to disable all of this and just have a\nversion of ``inspect.stack()`` that takes a coroutine object, you can.\n\n``asynctb`` requires Python 3.6 or later. It is tested with CPython\n(every minor version through 3.10-dev) and PyPy, on Linux, Windows,\nand macOS. It will probably work on other operating systems.\nBasic features will work on other interpreters, but the context\nmanager decoding will be less intelligent, and won't work at all\nwithout a usable ``gc.get_referents()``.\n\nThis is still in development. It has full test coverage, but\nwill likely undergo some incompatible API changes before an initial\nrelease. Documentation is also currently light. Watch this space!\n\nLicense: Your choice of MIT or Apache License 2.0\n\n\n",
