    "description": "# Unofficial Gamma ion pump ethernet control CLI utility and library\n\nThis is a mini Python 3 library and utility that exposes some of the functions\nof the Gamma Vacuum QPC ion pump controller via a CLI or via a library class\nvia it's Ethernet port.\n\n__Note__: This utility is in no way associated with Gamma Vacuum and is\n_not_ an official product. It's just a simple tool that emerged out of my\nrequirements to interact with their pump controllers. There is no guarantee that\nthis utility will work under any circumstances, won't damage your controller\nor will work after firmware upgrades, etc.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package can be installed by ```pip```. Depending on the environment\nand operating system:\n\n```\npython -m pip install gammaionctl-tspspi\n```\n\nor simply\n\n```\npip install gammaionctl-tspspi\n```\n\nIn case one does not want to use ```pip``` one can also simply copy ```src/gammaionctl/gammaionctl.py```\nand import from this file. There are no additional dependencies for the library.\n\n### Uninstalling\n\nUninstalling the package is also directly possible using ```pip``` if it has\nbeen installed that way:\n\n```\npython -m pip uninstall gammaionctl-tspspi\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip uninstall gammaionctl-tspspi\n```\n\n## Library API\n\nThe library exposes a single ```GammaIonPump``` class inside the ```gammactl```\npackage.\n\n### Creating an instance / connecting\n\nTo connect to an ion pump controller one simply instantiates the ```GammaIonPump```\nclass passing the remote host address - one can either do this explicit and call\nclose after one's done:\n\n```\npump = GammaIonPump(\"10.0.0.11\")\n# ...\npump.close()\n```\n\nOr one can use the ```with``` construct which is highly encouraged:\n\n```\nwith GammaIonPump(\"10.0.0.11\") as pump:\n    # Do whatever you want\n```\n\nThere is a ```setVerbose``` method that one can use to dump debug information\non ```stdout```. This is primarily thought for debugging purposes during\ndevelopment though. To enable verbose mode one can simply execute\n\n```\npump.setVerbose(True)\n```\n\n### Error handling\n\nAll methods either:\n\n* Return a value\n* Return ```None``` in case there is no measurement value such as pressure for a\n  disabled pump - in this case the connection stays active\n* ```False``` in case of I/O or network errors as well as protocol violations. In\n  this case the connection is dropped and no further commands are possible until\n  one reconnects by reinstantiation of the connection object.\n\n### Identifying the controller\n\nThe ```identify``` method returns the identification string of the controller\nor ```False``` in case of failure.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nid = pump.identify()\nprint(id) # Prints \"DIGITEL QPC\" for our controller\n```\n\n### Getting estimated vacuum pressure\n\nThe pumps are able to estimate the current pressure inside the pump volume based\non their pumping current. The pump index has to be 1-4 for the quad pump controller.\n\nThe method returns either:\n\n* the pressure in millibar as ```float```\n* ```None``` in case there is no measurement value (for example because the\n  pump is currently disabled)\n* ```False``` in case of a protocol violation. Then the connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Querying pressure for pump 1\npressure = pump.getPressure(1)\n```\n\n### Getting pump voltage\n\nFor every pump one can query the pump voltage of the ion pump using ```getVoltage```.\nAgain the pump index has to be 1-4 for the quad pump controller.\n\nThe method returns either:\n\n* the voltage in Volts as ```float```.\n* ```None``` in case there is no measurement value. Note that for a disabled pump\n  there is a standby current in the range of a few tens of volts that seems to be\n  used to detect if there is an pump attached.\n* ```False``` in case of a protocol violation. Then the connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Querying voltage for pump 1\nvolts = pump.getVoltage(1)\n```\n\n### Getting pump current\n\nFor every pump one can query the pump current of the ion pump using ```getCurrent```.\nAgain the pump index has to be 1-4 for the quad pump controller.\n\nThe method returns either:\n\n* the current in Millivolts as ```float```.\n* ```None``` in case there is no measurement value (for example for a disabled pump)\n* ```False``` in case of a protocol violation. Then the connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Querying current for pump 1\namps = pump.getCurrent(1)\n```\n\n### Querying the pump size\n\nUsing ```getPumpSize``` one can query the pump capacity of the pump in liters\nper second (```L/S```) for a pump index in the range from 1-4 for the quad pump\ncontroller.\n\nThe method returns either:\n\n* the pump capacity in liters per second as ```int```.\n* ```None``` in case there is no configured size (in case no pump is connected\n  for example)\n* ```False``` in case of a protocol violation. Then the connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Querying pump capacity for pump 1\ncapacity = pump.getPumpSize(1)\n```\n\n### Querying the current supply status\n\nIn addition (for human interfacing) one can query the supply status - the string\nshown on the controllers display - for every pump. This is done using ```getSupplyStatus```\nagain for a pump index in the range from 1-4 for the quad pump controller.\n\nThe method returns either:\n\n* the pump status as ```string```.\n* ```False``` in case of a protocol violation. Then the connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Querying pump status for pump 1\nstatus = pump.getSupplyStatus(1)\n```\n\n### Starting and stopping a pump\n\nTo enable a pump that's currently disabled on can use the ```enable``` method,\nto stop a running pump the ```disable``` method. These methods of course also\nrequire the pump index. They either return ```True``` in case the operation\nsucceeded (note this is idempotent so disabling a disabled pump is successful)\nor ```False``` in case of a protocol violation or connection error in which case\nthe connection has been dropped.\n\n```\n# Enabling pump 1\npump.enable(1)\n# Disabling pump 1\npump.disable(1)\n```\n",
