Introduction\n\nThe goal of this package is to provide you with a pipeline that can:\n  - automatically compile books written in [markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) to formats such as [pdf](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html), stand-alone [html](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/),\n[epub](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/), and [azw3](https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf),\n  - support a hierarchical file structure for the book sources, i.e., allow you divide the book into chapters in folders which can contain sub-folders with sections and sub-sub-folders with sub-sections,\n  - support the automatic download and inclusion of code snippets from [git repositories](https://git-scm.com),\n  - allow the book to be written in multiple languages, and finally\n  - automatically generate a website that lists all produced files so that you can copy everything to a web folder and offer your work for download without any further hassle.\n\nLet us say you are a university or college lecturer or a high school teacher.\nYou want to write a lecture script or a book as teaching material for your students.\nWhat do you need to do?\n\nWell, you need to write the book in some form or another, maybe in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) or with some other [editor](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer).\nBut usually your students would not want to read it like that, instead need to \"compile\" it to another format.\nOK, so you write the book and compile it to, say, [pdf](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html).\nThen you need to deliver the book, i.e., upload it to some website so that your students can access it.\nThus, everytime you want to improve or change your book, you have to run the process `change the text -> compile the text -> upload the result`.\nThe last two steps have nothing to do with actually writing the book, they just eat away your productive time.\nWith our tool suite, they can be fully automated.\n\nBut let us continue.\nWe said above you want to compile to [pdf](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html).\nThis format is maybe nice for printing, but maybe not so much for reading the book in a browser.\nFor this, you would want to have [html](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/).\nAnd if your student use hand-held devices or mobile phones, maybe you want to have your book also in [a format](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/) suitable for that.\nThis means you have at least three or four compile chains to get the right output and probably will run into problems with the conversations, too.\nWith our tool suite, all of this can be fully automated.\n\nEspecially, in the field of computer science, teaching material may also include [code snippets](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands).\nIf you just write the code snippets into the book text, you will probably commit errors and produce examples that your students cannot execute.\nI am a fan of unit testing of code and of providing examples and software that the students can really look at and use and execute.\nWhat I want is to have one or multiple GitHub repositories with my example codes.\nThis would allow to have unit testing and full-blown builds for the example codes.\nThen, in my book's text, I just want to reference (pieces of) files from these repositories and the book build chain should copy them into the book.\nWith our tool suite, [this can be done](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#git-repositories).\n\nActually, maybe I want to write the whole book on GitHub directly.\nThe \"full\" realization of the idea of our tool chain is that also the book text itself would be located in a GitHub repository.\nYou can write the text there, just as we did in our [examples given later](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#examples).\nWhenever you commit a set of changes, the book will be compiled to the formats mentioned above and automatically uploaded to the book's website.\nThere, it is ready for download for your students and always in the most up-to-date version.\nIf you do this, then you could also collaboratively work on a book, i.e., multiple authors could work on the text and commit to the same repository.\nAdditionally, students could submit an \"issue\" to the repository if they find that something is unclear or discover an error.\n\nThis is the way we want to use our tool chain (although you can also run it just locally on your own computer).\nAdditionally, our tool chain supports writing the book in [multiple languages](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) in parallel.\nBut more about this later.\n\n\n## 2. Installation and Local Use\n\nThe following examples are for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) [Linux](https://www.linux.org).\nUnder other Linux flavors, they may work differently and different commands may be required.\nExecute the examples at your own risk.\n\n\n### 2.1. Local Installation and Use\n\n#### 2.1.1. Installation of the Package\n\nIn order to use this package and to, e.g., run the example codes, you need to first install it using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).\nYou can install the newest version of this library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/bookbuilderpy/) using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by doing\n\n```shell\npip install bookbuilderpy\n```\n\nThis will install the latest official release of our package.\nIf you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released), you can do\n\n```shell\npip install git+https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy.git\n```\n\nIf you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released) and you have set up a private/public key for GitHub, you can also do:\n\n```shell\ngit clone ssh://git@github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy\ngit install bookbuilderpy\n```\n\nThis may sometimes work better if you are having trouble reaching GitHub via `https` or `http`.\nYou can also clone the repository and then run a `make` build, which will automatically install all dependencies, run all the tests, and then install the package on your system, too.\nIf this build completes successful, you can be sure that `bookbuilderpy` will work properly on your machine.\n\n\n#### 2.1.2. Installation of the Tool Chain\n\nIf you want the full tool chain, though, you also need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/), and [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) must be installed.\nAdditionally, you should have installed `git`, [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), the [Firefox geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver), and [ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/).\nMost likely, this package will only work under [Linux](https://www.linux.org) &ndash; at least I did not test it under Windows.\nAll commands and examples in the following require [Linux](https://www.linux.org).\n\n\n### 2.2. Using the Docker Image\n\nSo it might be easier to just use the [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy/) that comes with everything pre-installed.\nYou can then run it as:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -v \"INPUT_DIR\":/input/:ro \\\n           -v \"OUTPUT_DIR\":/output/ \\\n           thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy BOOK_ROOT_MD_FILE\n```\n\nUnder many distributions, you need to run this command as `sudo`.\nHere, it is assumed that\n\n- `INPUT_DIR` is the directory where your book sources reside, let's say `/home/my/book/sources/`. (By adding `:ro`, we mount the input directory read-only, just in case.)\n- `BOOK_ROOT_MD_FILE` is the root file of your book, say `book.md` (in which case, the full path of `book.md` would be `/home/my/book/sources/book.md`). Notice that you can specify only a single file, but this file can reference other files in sub-directories of `INPUT_DIR` by using commands such as  `\\rel.input` (see [below](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands)).\n- `OUTPUT_DIR` is the output directory where the compiled files should be placed, e.g., `/home/my/book/compiled/`. This is where the resulting files will be placed.\n\n### 2.3. Examples\n\nIf you are a learning-by-doing person, you can clone the \"minimal working example\" repository [thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe).\nThis repository contains a book template showcasing many of the important commands and features of the system.\nIt is automatically compiled and published on each commit.\nThe website, which then is re-generated automatically each time, is <https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy-mwe>\nYou can run the example under [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) Linux by cloning the repository executing the build process on this repository with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) as follows, **but execute the code below at your own risk!**\n\n```shell\nmkdir example\ncd example\ngit clone https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe.git\nmkdir result\nsudo docker run -v \"$(pwd)/bookbuilderpy-mwe\":/input/:ro -v \"$(pwd)/result\":/output/ thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy book.md\nsudo chown $USER -R result\n```\n\nAbove, we create a folder called `example`.\nWe then clone the repository [thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe), creating the folder `bookbuilderpy-mwe` containing the example book sources.\nThen, directory `result` is created, into which we will build the book.\nWith `sudo docker run -v bookbuilderpy-mwe:/input/:ro -v result:/output/ thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy book.md`, the build process is executed.\nSince it runs under `sudo`, the files will be generated with `sudo` permissions/ownership, so we transfer them to the user ownership via `sudo chown $USER -R result`.\nYou can now peek into the `result` folder.\nIt will contain a file `index.html`, which is the automatically generated (bare minimum) book website, from which you can access all other generated files.\n\nNotice that you can also automate your whole book building *and publishing* process using our [GitHub Pipeline](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#github-pipeline) later discussed in [Section&nbsp;4](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#github-pipeline).\nAnother example for the use of this pipeline is our book [Optimization Algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/oa).\nThe source code of this book is in the GitHub repository [thomasWeise/oa](https://github.com/thomasWeise/oa).\n\n## 3. Provided Functionality\n\nOur book building pipeline is based on [pandoc flavored markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) and the filters [`pandoc-citeproc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc), [`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref), [`latex-formulae-pandoc`](https://github.com/liamoc/latex-formulae), and [`pandoc-citeproc-preamble`](https://github.com/spwhitton/pandoc-citeproc-preamble).\nIt supports the commands and syntax given there, some of which is summarized below in [Section&nbsp;3.1](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#basic-commands-provided-by-pandoc-and-off-the-shelf-filters).\nHowever, we add several commands, such as a hierarchical file inclusion structure, a support for multi-language file resolution, a support for including program listings from git repositories, and so on.\nThese extensions are discussed in [Section&nbsp;3.2](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands).\n\n## 3.1. Basic commands provided by `pandoc` and off-the-shelf filters\n\nThe following basic commands are already available in pandoc's [markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) flavor and/or are provided by the existing pandoc plugins that we use:\n\n- Chapters, sections, sub-sections etc. are created by putting their title on a single line preceded by `#`, `##`, or `###`, etc.\n  For example, the line `## This is a section` (two `#`) starts a section with the given title, `# This is a chapter` (one `#`) starts a chapter.\n  You can add labels to sections, by writing `# Chapter Title {#sec:myChap}` and reference them via `As already discussed in [@sec:myChap], we found...`.\n  The prefix `sec:` is required for such labels.\n  Sections and chapters etc. are numbered automatically.\n  If you want an unnumbered section, write `## Other Section {-}`.\n- You can use LaTeX maths as inline formulae such `$\\sqrt{5}+4^4$` and as stand-alone equations like `$$x=\\frac{5}{6}$$`.\n  A line such as `$$ x = y + z $$ {#eq:xyz}` will create an equation that can be referenced using `[@eq:xyz]` in the text.\n  Notice: It is best to use `\\ldots` instead of `\\dots` to avoid problems.\n- References to bibliography can be done `[@ABC; @DEF]` where `ABC` and `DEF` would then be keys into your [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/)) file, which, in turn, would be specified in the metadata as `bibliography: bibtexfile.bib`.\n- *Emphasized* text is written in between `*`s, e.g., `The word *text* is emphasized.`.\n- **Double emphasized** text is written in between double-`*`s, e.g. `The word **text** is very much emphasized.`\n- Short verbatim/code text is written in between &grave;s, e.g., *The word &grave;`text`&grave; appears as code.*\n- Abbreviations and LaTeX-style commands can be created and called normally, as long as they do not clash with the [`bookbuilderpy`-specific commands](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands).\n  For example, you can do:\n\n```\n\\newcommand{\\mathSpace}[1]{\\mathbb{#1}}\n\\newcommand{\\realNumbers}{\\mathSpace{R}}\n\nAssume that $x\\in\\realNumbers$ is a value larger than $2$, then $\\sqrt{x}>1$ is also true.\n```\n\n- Tables can be created as follows:\n\n```\nThis is some normal text.\n\n|centered column|right-aligned column|left-aligned column|\n|:-:|--:|:--|\n|bla|r|l|\n|blub blub blub|abc|123|\n\n: This is the table caption. {#tbl:mytable}\n\nFrom [@tbl:mytable], we can see that...\n```\n\n- Figures should be included using the [`bookbuilderpy`-specific](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands) `\\rel.figure{...}` command.\n\n## 3.2. `bookbuilderpy`-specific commands\n\nThe following new commands are added:\n\n- `\\rel.input{path}` recursively includes and processes the contents of the file identified by `path`. `path` must be in a sub-folder of the current folder. The deepest folder of the new full path will become the current folder for any (recursive) `\\rel.input{path}` invocations in the new file as well as `\\rel.code` and `\\rel.figure` commands. [Language-specific file resolution](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) will apply.\n- `\\rel.code{label}{caption}{path}{lines}{labels}{args}` is used to include code (or portions of code) from a source code file located in the current folder (or any `path` beneath it).\n  [Language-specific file resolution](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) will apply.\n  This command has the following arguments:\n  + `label`: the label of the listing, e.g., `something`. Will automatically be prefixed by `lst:` and can then be referenced in the text, e.g., as `The algorithm is specified in [@lst:something].`.\n  + `caption`: the caption of the listing\n  + `path`: the relative path fragment to resolve\n  + `lines`: the lines of the code to keep in the form `1-3,6`, or empty to keep all\n  + `labels`: the labels for selecting code pieces, or empty to keep all. For instance, specifying `a,b` will keep all code between line comments `start a` and `end a` and `start b` and `end b`. By ending a line outside the selected range with line comment `+a` (where `a` is again a label name), it will be included. If it is inside the selected range and ends with line comment `-a`, it is excluded.\n  + args: any additional, language-specific arguments to pass to the code renderer, as comma-separated strings.\n    - For Python, we automatically strip type hints, docstrings, and comments from the code and also re-format the code. The re-formatting ensures that lines are no longer than 70 characters, which is necessary to make the listings in PDFs to look nicely.\n      With `doc` you keep the docstrings, with `comments` you keep the comments, with `hints` you keep the type hints.\n      If you specify `format`, then the code is not reformatted at all (which automatically preserves docstrings, type hints, and comments, except for the code selection labels.)\n- `\\git.code{repo}{label}{caption}{path}{lines}{labels}{args}` works the same as `\\relative.code`, but uses code from the specified git repository instead (see [Metadata](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#git-repositories)).\n  [Language-specific file resolution](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) does *not* apply, however, you may specify repositories differently for each language in the metadata.\n- `\\rel.figure{label}{caption}{path}{args}` includes a figure into the book. [Language-specific file resolution](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) will apply.\n  This command has the following arguments:\n  + `label`: the label of the figure, e.g., `something`. It will be automatically prefixed by `fig:` can then be referenced in the text, e.g., as `As illustrated in [@fig:something], ...`.\n  + `caption`: the caption of the figure\n  + `path`: the relative path fragment to resolve\n  + `args`: other arguments, e.g., `width=XX%` for making the figure having a width corresponding to `XX%` of the available with.\n- `\\definition{type}{label}{body}` creates a definition of the given type (where the metadata must somewhere specify `typeTitle`) that can be referenced via `\\def.ref{label}` anywhere in the text.\n  The body containing the actual definition of the definition is `body`.\n  For example `\\definition{def}{bla}{A *definition* is a text about something.}` with `defTitle: Definition` in the metadata would generate something like `**Definition 1**: A *definition* is a text about something.` and `\\def.ref{bla}` would then become `Definition 1` (but as clickable hyperlink).\n- `\\meta{key}` any metadata string you specify in your [metadata](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#metadata), including `title`, `author`, etc., with the following additional keys:\n  + `time`: the ISO date and time when the book building process was started,\n  + `date`: the ISO date when the book building process was started,\n  + `year`: the year when the book building process was started,\n  + `lang`: the current [language](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) id, or `en` if none is specified\n  + `locale`: the locale inferred from the current language id\n  + `lang.name`: the current language name, or `English` if none is specified\n  + `repo.name`: if it was detected that the build process is applied to a git repository checkout, then this is the repository name, e.g., `thomasweise/bookbuilderpy`; otherwise querying this property will fail the build process.\n  + `repo.url`:  if it was detected that the build process is applied to a git repository check out, then this is the repository url, such as `https://github.com/thomasweise/bookbuilderpy`; otherwise querying this property will fail the build process.\n  + `repo.commit`:  if it was detected that the build process is applied to a git repository checkout, then this is the commit id of the checkout; otherwise querying this property will fail the build process.\n  + `repo.date`:  if it was detected that the build process is applied to a git repository checkout, then this is the date of the commit that was checked-out; otherwise querying this property will fail the build process.\n\n## 3.3. Metadata\n\nThe metadata of your book is a very important portion that specifies not just its title and author, but also all the information for the build process.\nIt should be located in a file `metadata.yaml` and the very first line of your main book file then must be a `\\rel.input` of this metadata file.\nIn the metadata section of your book, you can define things such as the book title and author etc.\nWe added the following metadata items:\n\n### 3.3.1. Language Specification and Resolution\n\nYou can develop your book in multiple languages in parallel.\nThese can be specified in the metadata following the pattern below:\n\n```yaml\nlangs:\n  - id: en\n    name: English\n  - id: de\n    name: Deutsch\n  - id: zh\n    name: 中文\n```\n\nThe `langs` entry specifies a list, where each item must have an `id` and a `name`.\nThe `id` will be used to determine the [locale](https://cldr.unicode.org/)  of the text.\nYou can either use a [locale](https://cldr.unicode.org/) directly, or one of the following shortcuts: `en` for `en_US`, `zh` or `cn` for `zh_CN`, `tw` for `zh_TW`, `de` for `de_DE`, `fr` for `fr_FR`, `it` for `it_IT`, `ja` for `ja_JP`, `ko` for `ko_KR`, `pt` for `pt_BR`, and `es` for `es_ES`.\n**Warning&nbsp;1**: Do not specify the `lang` attribute usually used by pandoc, as this causes some trouble.\n**Warning&nbsp;2**: If you only specify a single language, the book's main file name cannot be `index.md`.\n**Warning&nbsp;3**: If you want to build a book in the Chinese language, you must specify the language Chinese with one of the Chinese-related prefixes above.\n\nThe language name will appear in things such as the automatically generate website, etc.\nFor each language, one book building process will be performed.\nIn the above example, we will build the book three times, for English, German, and Chinese.\nIf the book's basic file name was `book.md`, we will get `book_en.pdf`, `book_de.pdf`, and `book_zh.pdf`.\nIf only one language was specified, we would just get `book.pdf`.\n\nThe language `id` has one very important purpose:\nIt allows for language-specific file resolution.\nFor instance, let's say you do `\\rel.input{folder/README.md}`.\nIn the `en`-build step, this will first look for a file `folder/README_en.md`.\nIf it exists, it is included.\nOtherwise, the file `folder/README.md` will be included.\n\nThe same will be done for `\\rel.figure` commands.\nThis way, you can, e.g., create language-neutral figures that are the same for all versions of the book as well as language-specific figures that contain texts.\n\nIt makes sense to split your metadata into language-specific and language-agnostic data.\nFor example, the style and title page background of your book may be language-agnostic.\nThe title, definition types, figure titles, table titles, keywords, and even font may be language-specific.\nThis can be accomplished by using `\\rel.input` in the `metadata.yaml` file!\nFor the very first language (in our example English) create a file `metalang.yaml` and put all the language-specific information for that first language in there.\nThis will be the default setting for anything else not specified for the other language and also for the website title generation.\nThen, for each other language, create one language-specific file, say `metalang_de.yaml` and `metalang_zh.yaml` in our example.\nFinally, simply first specify the `langs` list in the `metadata.yaml`, and then `\\rel.input{metalang.yaml}` and let the language-specific file resolution do the rest&hellip;\n\nLast but not least, the language id will be used to decide which pdf-engine is used for building the book.\nFor instance, a language ID like `zh`, indicating Chinese, will lead to the use of `xelatex`, while otherwise `pdflatex` will be used.\n\n### 3.3.2. Git Repositories\n\nIt is possible to include code from one or multiple git repositories using the `\\git.code` command.\nFor this purpose, you first need to specify the repositories in the metadata section as follows:\n\n```yaml\nrepos:\n  - id: mp\n    url: https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy.git\n  - id: bb\n    url: https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy.git\n```\n\nThe above list specifies two git repository mnemonics, `mp` and `bp`.\nWhen the book is being built, both repositories are automatically checked out.\nThe `\\git.code{repo}{label}{caption}{path}{lines}{labels}{args}` command with `repo` set to `mp` will then refer to the first repository (`bookbuilderpy`) and the `path` argument then is a path relative to the repository root.\n`repo=bb` would instead refer to the `bookbuilderpy` repository.\n\n### 3.3.3. Website Construction\n\nIt is possible to automatically generate a website during the build process.\nYou can then upload the website and all of the generated files to your website, offering an easy way to download your book.\nThe mechanism is very simple:\nWe can have an \"outer\" website, i.e., an HTML file with styles and headers and stuff and an \"inner\" website which can be a portion of markdown code.\nThe idea is that the \"inner\" website could be the `README.md` file of the repository where your book is and the outer website allows you to specify a container and proper CSS styles for rendering it.\nBoth can be specified in the metadata, e.g., as follows:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# ... other stuff\n\n# the website\nwebsite_outer: meta/website.html\nwebsite_body: README.md\n\n# ... other stuff\n...\n```\n\nThis mechanism works as follows:\nThe inner website (in this case, the file ` website.html` in the folder `meta` is loaded as a string.\nInside, all the `\\meta{...}` commands accessing meta-data are evaluated (see [`bookbuilderpy` specific commands](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#bookbuilderpy-specific-commands)).\nHere, the first language's metadata attribute values will be used if multiple languages were specified.\nThe outer website *can* contain the text `{body}` exactly once and this text is then replaced by the rendered markdown of the inner website.\nHere, this would be the file `README.md` in the root folder.\nThe inner website *can* then somewhere contain a div tag `<div id=\"files\"> .... </div>`.\nIf present, this tag and everything inside will be replaced with an automatically generated list of all the generated files.\nIf the [`langs` attribute](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) is specified and contains more than one language, there will be one nested list per language.\nOtherwise, the list will be flat.\nThe lists will have the following CSS-classes:\n\n- `langs`: for the main list of multiple languages<sup>*</sup>\n- `oneLang`: for the language list item<sup>*</sup>\n- `oneLangName`: for the span with the language name<sup>*</sup>\n- `downloads`: for the download list per language\n- `download`: for the download list entry\n- `downloadFile`: for the span containing the file download\n- `downloadFileName`: for the span with the file name\n- `downloadFileSize`: for the span with the file size\n- `downloadFileDesc`: for the description of the file format\n\n<sup>*</sup> if the [`langs` attribute](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#language-specification-and-resolution) is specified and contains more than one language\nThe result of this rendering process is then stored in a file `index.html`.\nFor this reason you should never call your main book file `index.md`.\n\nThe idea of this website building process is as follows:\nVia the \"outer\" website, you can specify the structure, header, footer (where you could, e.g., place the build time via a `\\meta{date}` command), and CSS styles.\nIf you develop your book on GitHub, then you would probably write a `README.md` file explaining the book's content anyway.\nThis file you can then automatically render and insert into the website as \"inner\" website part.\nInside your `README.md` on GitHub, the tag `<div id=\"files\"> .... </div>` would be invisible, but during the website building, it allows you to have the list of book files included automatically.\nThis automatic inclusions allows us to specify file sizes.\nFor course, we could also simply not insert this tag and instead have hard-coded links in the `README.md`, which is fine, too.\n\n### 3.3.4. Other Metadata\n\n- `title`: the book's title\n- `keywords`: a list of keywords\n- `author`: the book author or a list of authors\n- `date`: the date when the book was written (you can set this to `\\meta{data}` and the current date of the build process will be used).\n- `bibliography`: the path to the [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) file, e.g., `bibliography.bib`\n- `csl`: the [bibliography style](https://citationstyles.org). Set this to `association-for-computing-machinery.csl` to use the default style offered by the package.\n  You can find many different bibliography styles at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.\n- `link-citations`: set this to `true` to get clickable bibliography references.\n- `template.html`: the template for rendering to HTML. Set this to `GitHub.html5` to use the default style offered by the package.\n- `template.latex`: the template for rendering to PDF. Set this to `eisvogel.tex` to use the default style offered by the package.\n- If you build a book in a language different from English, you will certainly want to change the default caption prefixes for figures and tables accordingly.\n  The following language-specific component titles (below explained-by-example) are supported by pandoc and its filters:\n\n```yaml\nfigureTitle: Figure\ntableTitle: Table\nlistingTitle: Listing\n\nfigPrefix:\n  - \"Figure\"\n  - \"Figures\"\neqnPrefix:\n  - \"Equation\"\n  - \"Equations\"\ntblPrefix:\n  - \"Table\"\n  - \"Tables\"\nlstPrefix:\n  - \"Listing\"\n  - \"Listings\"\nsecPrefix:\n  - \"Section\"\n  - \"Sections\"\n\nreference-section-title: References\n```\n- Please notice that there is an [issue](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/issues/329) with chapter names in the pdf output.\n  You can fix this by setting up the chapter and section names *also* in the LaTeX header includes (see below).\n\n- Any other `xxxTitle` allows you to specify a `type`to be used for a `\\definition{type}{label}{body}` command.\n- `header-includes`: allows you to insert stuff into the headers of the format.\n  For PDF/LaTeX, it is useful to put something like the stuff below, as it will make the result nicer if you have many code listings:\n\n```yaml\n# line 1..3: hold floating objects in the same section and sub-section\n# line 4..6: prevent ugly broken footnotes\n# line 7..9: fix section and chapter names\nheader-includes:\n- |\n  ```{=latex}\n  \\usepackage[section,above,below]{placeins}%               1\n  \\let\\Oldsubsection\\subsection%                            2\n  \\renewcommand{\\subsection}{\\FloatBarrier\\Oldsubsection}%  2\n  \\addtolength{\\topskip}{0pt plus 10pt}%                    4\n  \\interfootnotelinepenalty=10000%                          5\n  \\raggedbottom%                                            6\n  \\usepackage[nameinlink]{cleveref}%                        7\n  \\crefname{chapter}{Chapter}{Chapters}%                    8\n  \\crefname{section}{Section}{Sections}%                    9\n  ` ` `\n```\n(without the spaces between the triple-backticks!)\nIn the two `\\crefname` commands at the end, you can put the singular and plural forms of the names for chapters and sections in your language of choice.\n\nFor Chinese versions of your book using our default template ([Wandmalfarben/Eisvogel](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#wandmalfarbepandoc-latex-template)), you may instead want to use the following `header-includes` in order to work-around the a [minor issue](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/issues/256) with the template.\n\n```yaml\n# line 1..3: hold floating objects in the same section and sub-section\n# line 4..6: prevent ugly broken footnotes\n# line 7..9: fix section and chapter names\n# line 10..12: fix bug https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/issues/256\nheader-includes:\n- |\n  ```{=latex}\n  \\usepackage[section,above,below]{placeins}%                 1\n  \\let\\Oldsubsection\\subsection%                              2\n  \\renewcommand{\\subsection}{\\FloatBarrier\\Oldsubsection}%    3\n  \\addtolength{\\topskip}{0pt plus 10pt}%                      4\n  \\interfootnotelinepenalty=10000%                            5\n  \\raggedbottom%                                              6\n  \\AtBeginDocument{%                                        7\n  \\crefname{chapter}{章}{章}%                                  8\n  \\crefname{section}{节}{节}%                                 9\n  \\addto\\captionsenglish{\\renewcommand{\\figurename}{图}}%    10\n  \\addto\\captionsenglish{\\renewcommand{\\tablename}{表}}%     11\n  }%                                                        12\n  ` ` `\n```\n(without the spaces between the triple-backticks!)\n\n\n- Setup for pandoc's crossref: You may wish to include the following text\n```yaml\n# pandoc-crossref setup\ncref: true\nchapters: true\nlinkReferences: true\nnameInLink: true\nlistings: false\ncodeBlockCaptions: true\n```\n\n### 3.4. Graphics\n\nGenerally, we suggest to use only vector graphics in your books, as opposed to raster graphics like `jpg` or `png`.\nDon't use `jpg` or `png` for anything different from photos.\nVector graphics can scale well and have a higher quality when being printed or when being zoomed in.\nRaster graphics often get blurry or even display artifacts.\n\nIn my opinion, the best graphics format to use in conjunction with our tool is `svg` (and, in particular, its compressed variant `svgz`).\nYou can create `svg` graphics using the open-source editor Inkscape or software such as Adobe Illustrator or Corel DRAW.\n\nWe provide the small tool [ultraSvgz](https://github.com/thomasWeise/ultraSvgz), which runs under Linux and can create very small, minified and compressed `svgz` files from `svg`s.\nOur tool suite supports `svgz` fully and such files tend to actually be smaller than `pdf` or `eps` graphics.\n\n## 4. GitHub Pipeline\n\nAs discussed under point [Installation and Local Use](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy/index.html#installation-and-local-use), our tool suite is available as [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy/), so you only need a [docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to run the complete software locally.\nHowever, the bigger goal is to allow you to collaboratively write books, interact with your readers, and automatically publish them online.\nWith [docker](https://www.docker.com) in combination with [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), this is now easily possible.\n\nYou can find a [template book project](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe) using the complete automated pipeline discussed here in the repository [thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe).\nIn other words, if you do not want to read the text and explanation below, you can as well just clone this template project and adapt everything to your liking.\n\nYou can integrate the whole process with a version control software like `git` and a continuous integration framework.\nThen, you can automate the compilation of your book to run every time you change your book sources.\nActually, there are several open source and free environments that you can use to that for you for free &ndash; in exchange for you making your book free for everyone to read.\n\nFirst, both for writing and hosting the book, we suggest using a [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) repository, very much like the one for the book I just began working on [here](https://github.com/thomasWeise/oa).\nThe book should be written in [Pandoc's markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) syntax, which allows us to include most of the stuff we need, such as equations and citation references, with the additional comments listed above.\nFor building the book, we will use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which are triggered by repository commits.\n\nEvery time you push a commit to your book repository, the GitHub Action will check out the repository.\nThe docker container can automatically build the book and book website.\nThe result can automatically be deployed to the [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) branch of your repository and which will then be the website of the repository.\nOnce the repository, website, and Travis build procedure are all set up, we can concentrate on working on our book and whenever some section or text is finished, commit, and enjoy the automatically new versions.\n\nHaving your book sources on GitHub brings several additional advantages, for instance:\n\n- Since the book's sources are available as GitHub repository, our readers can file issues to the repository, with change suggestions, discovered typos, or with questions to add clarification.\n- They may even file pull requests with content to include.\n- You could also write a book collaboratively &ndash; like a software project. This might also be interesting for students who write course notes together.\n\n### 4.1. The Repository\n\nIn order to use our workflow, you need to first have an account at [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and then create an open repository for your book.\nGitHub is built around the distributed version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/), for which a variety of [graphical user interfaces](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) exist - see, e.g., of [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).\nIf you have a Debian-based Linux system, you can install the basic `git` client with command line interface as follows: `sudo apt-get install git` and the gui [`git-cola`](https://git-cola.github.io/) which can be installed via `sudo apt-get install git-cola`.\nYou can use either this client or such a GUI to work with your repository.\n\nYou can now fill your repository with your book's source files.\nThe repository [thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe) gives you a bare example how that can look like.\n\n## 4.2. The GitHub Action\n\nCreate a folder `.github/workflows` and inside this folder a file `build.yaml`.\nThe contents of the file should be:\n\n```yaml\nname: publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: docker-practice/actions-setup-docker@master\n    - name: build\n      run: |\n        mkdir -p /tmp/result\n        docker run -v $(pwd):/input/:ro -v /tmp/result/:/output/ thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy book.md\n        touch /tmp/result/.nojekyll\n\n    - name: deploy\n      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4\n      with:\n        branch: gh-pages\n        folder: /tmp/result\n        single-commit: true\n```\n\nThis will toggle the build whenever you commit to the branch `main`.\nIt will then first check out the book sources.\nThen it will create the temporary folder `/tmp/result` and use the docker container to build the book to this folder.\nThe `touch /tmp/result/.nojekyll` just adds a file to that folder telling GitHub pages that the files in there do not need to be processed any further and can be served as-is.\nAfter that, the files in this folder will be deployed to the branch `gh-pages`, which will become the website for your book.\n\nLet's say your username was `thomasWeise` and your book repository was `bookbuilderpy-mwe`.\nTo make this website visible, go to your GitHub project's [thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy-mwe), click `Settings`, then go to `Pages`, then under `Source` choose `gh-pages` and click `Save`.\nA few minutes afterwards, your book's website will appear as <https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy-mwe>.\n(It may also be that you may need to make one more commit to the repository to trigger this.)\nDone.\nWhenever you commit to your book sources, the book will be compiled and the website is updated.\nNothing else needed.\n\n## 5.
