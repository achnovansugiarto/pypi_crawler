For example:\n\n```py\n{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py\n```\n\n- Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.\n- 100% of templating is done with Jinja2. This includes file and directory names.\n- Simply define your template variables in a `cookiecutter.json` file. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"full_name\": \"Audrey Roy Greenfeld\",\n  \"email\": \"audreyr@gmail.com\",\n  \"project_name\": \"Complexity\",\n  \"repo_name\": \"complexity\",\n  \"project_short_description\": \"Refreshingly simple static site generator.\",\n  \"release_date\": \"2013-07-10\",\n  \"year\": \"2013\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.1\"\n}\n```\n\n- Unless you suppress it with `--no-input`, you are prompted for input:\n  - Prompts are the keys in `cookiecutter.json`.\n  - Default responses are the values in `cookiecutter.json`.\n  - Prompts are shown in order.\n- Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:\n\n```yaml\ndefault_context:\n  full_name: \"Audrey Roy Greenfeld\"\n  email: \"audreyr@gmail.com\"\n  github_username: \"audreyfeldroy\"\ncookiecutters_dir: \"~/.cookiecutters/\"\n```\n\n- Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into\n  `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.\n- If you have already cloned a cookiecutter into `~/.cookiecutters/`,\n  you can reference it by directory name:\n\n```bash\n# Clone cookiecutter-pypackage\n$ cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n# Now you can use the already cloned cookiecutter by name\n$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage\n```\n\n- You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git\n  repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.\n- Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults\n  whenever you generate a project.\n- Inject extra context with command-line arguments:\n\n```bash\ncookiecutter --no-input gh:msabramo/cookiecutter-supervisor program_name=foobar startsecs=10\n```\n\n- Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for injection of extra context.\n- Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after\n  generating a project.\n- Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.\n- Projects generated to your current directory or to target directory if\n  specified with `-o` option.\n\n## Available Cookiecutters\n\nMaking great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors. We're so\npleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose from. We\nhope you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.\n\n## A Pantry Full of Cookiecutters\n\nThe best place to start searching for specific and ready to use cookiecutter\ntemplate is [Github search](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories).\nJust type `cookiecutter` and you will discover over 4000 related repositories.\n\nWe also recommend you to check related GitHub topics. For general search use\n[cookiecutter-template](https://github.com/topics/cookiecutter-template).\nFor specific topics try to use `cookiecutter-yourtopic`, like\n`cookiecutter-python` or `cookiecutter-datascience`. This is a new GitHub feature,\nso not all active repositories use it at the moment.\n\nIf you are template developer please add related\n[topics](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)\nwith `cookiecutter` prefix to you repository. We believe it will make it more\ndiscoverable. You are almost not limited in topics amount, use it!\n\n## Cookiecutter Specials\n\nThese Cookiecutters are maintained by the cookiecutter team:\n\n- [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage):\n  [@audreyfeldroy's](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) ultimate Python package project template.\n- [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django):\n  A bleeding edge Django project template with Bootstrap 4, customizable users app,\n  starter templates, working user registration, celery setup, and much more.\n- [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin):\n  Minimal Cookiecutter template for authoring [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)\n  plugins that help you to write better programs.\n\n## Community\n\nThe core committer team can be found in [authors section](AUTHORS.md).\nWe are always welcome and invite you to participate.\n\nStuck? Try one of the following:\n\n- See the [Troubleshooting](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html) page.\n- Ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cookiecutter).\n- You are strongly encouraged to\n  [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\n  about the problem, even if it's just \"I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter\"\n  with a link to your cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue\n  properly.\n- Ask for help on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U)\n  if you must (but please try one of the other options first, so that others\n  can benefit from the discussion).\n\nDevelopment on Cookiecutter is community-driven:\n\n- Huge thanks to all the [contributors](AUTHORS.md) who have pitched in to help\n  make Cookiecutter an even better tool.\n- Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the\n  [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md), then get started.\n- Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on\n  [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cookie-cutter/shared_invite/enQtNzI0Mzg5NjE5Nzk5LTRlYWI2YTZhYmQ4YmU1Y2Q2NmE1ZjkwOGM0NDQyNTIwY2M4ZTgyNDVkNjMxMDdhZGI5ZGE5YmJjM2M3ODJlY2U)\n  (note: due to work and commitments, a core committer might not always be available)\n\nEncouragement is unbelievably motivating. If you want more work done on\nCookiecutter, show support:\n\n- Thank a core committer for their efforts.\n- Star [Cookiecutter on GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).\n- [Support this project](#support-this-project)\n\nGot criticism or complaints?\n\n- [File an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\n  so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly and constructive about what\n  could be better. Make detailed suggestions.\n- **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.** For example, if you are\n  discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list,\n  [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\n  where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on the email.\n- Be encouraging. A comment like \"This function ought to be rewritten like this\"\n  is much more likely to result in action than a comment like \"Eww, look how bad\n  this function is.\"\n\nWaiting for a response to an issue/question?\n\n- Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar\n  and will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through.\n  If urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.\n- Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.\n- Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.\n- Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait?\n  [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) is available for hire for consultation\n  or custom development.\n\n## Support This Project\n\nThis project is run by volunteers. Shortly we will be providing means for\norganizations and individuals to support the project.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone interacting in the Cookiecutter project's codebases, issue trackers,\nchat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the\n[PyPA Code of Conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/).\n\n\n",
