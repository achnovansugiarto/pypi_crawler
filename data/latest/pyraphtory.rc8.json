It lets you run complex queries on your data, no matter where it's stored or what format it's in. But that's not all - Raphtory's real superpower is its ability to track and explore the history of a complex system, from \"time traveling\" through data to executing advanced analysis like taint tracking, temporal reachability, and mining temporal motifs.\n\n**Raphtory is easy to use:** just run a single pip install command and embed it with your existing Python/Pandas pipeline for input and output.\n\n**Raphtory is expressive:** It's designed to represent all types of graph queries and has a well-developed API for exploring your data across its history.\n\n**Raphtory is lightning-fast and scales effortlessly**: Built on Apache Arrow's storage and vectorized compute, Raphtory can be run on a laptop or a distributed cluster for terabyte-scale graphs.\n\n# Running a basic example\n\n```python\n#¬†Import Raphtory\nimport PyRaphtory\n\n#¬†Create a new local or distributed context\nctx = PyRaphtory.local()\ngraph = ctx.new_graph()\n\n# Add some data to your graph\ngraph.add_vertex(1, 1)\ngraph.add_vertex(2, 2)\ngraph.add_vertex(3, 3)\ngraph.add_edge(4, 1, 2)\ngraph.add_edge(4, 1, 3)\n\n# Collect some simple vertex metrics\n#¬†Ran across a range of the data with incremental windowing\ndf = graph\n      .range(1,4,1)\n      .window(1)\n      .step(lambda vertex: vertex.set_state(\"name\", vertex.name()))\n      .step(lambda vertex: vertex.set_state(\"out_degree\", vertex.out_degree())) \n      .step(lambda vertex: vertex.set_state(\"in_degree\", vertex.in_degree()))\n      .select(\"name\", \"out_degree\", \"in_degree\")\n      .to_df()\n\n# Preview DataFrame\ndf\n\n|    |   timestamp |   window |   name |   out_degree |   in_degree |\n|----|-------------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n|  0 |           1 |        1 |      1 |            0 |           0 |\n|  1 |           2 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           0 |\n|  2 |           3 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           0 |\n|  3 |           4 |        1 |      1 |            2 |           0 |\n|  4 |           4 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           1 |\n|  5 |           4 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           1 |\n```\n\n# Installing Raphtory \n\nRaphtory is available for Python and Scala/Java, with support for Rust planned in version 0.3.0. We recommend using the PyRaphtory client for Python, which includes everything you need and can be run locally or in distributed mode.\n\nYou should have Python version 3.9 or higher. It's a good idea to use conda, virtualenv, or pyenv. \n\n```bash\npip install pyraphtory\n``` \n\n# Examples and Notebooks\n\nCheck out Raphtory in action with our interactive Jupyter Notebook!
