    "description": "finagg: Financial Aggregation for Python\n========================================\n\n**finagg** is a Python package that provides implementations of popular and free\nfinancial APIs, tools for aggregating historical data from those APIs into SQL\ndatabases, and tools for transforming aggregated data into features useful for\nanalysis and AI/ML.\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall **finagg** from GitHub directly.\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    git clone https://github.com/theOGognf/finagg.git\n    pip install ./finagg/\n\nOptionally install the recommended datasets from 3rd party APIs into a local\nSQL database.\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    finagg install --help\n\nThe installation will point you where to get free API keys and write them to a\nlocal ``.env`` file for storage.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nExplore the APIs directly\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nGet Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

variables to expose your API keys and user agents\nto **finagg**, or you can pass your API keys and user agents to the implemented\nAPIs programmatically. The following environment variables are used for\nconfiguring API keys and user agents:\n\n* ``BEA_API_KEY`` is for the Bureau of Economic Analysis's API key. You can get\n  a free API key from the `BEA API site`_.\n* ``FRED_API_KEY`` is for the Federal Reserve Economic Data API key. You can get\n  a free API key from the `FRED API site`_.\n* ``INDICES_API_USER_AGENT`` is for scraping popular indices' compositions from\n  Wikipedia and should be equivalent to a browser's user agent declaration.\n  This defaults to a hardcoded value, but it may not always work.\n* ``SEC_API_USER_AGENT`` is for the Securities and Exchange Commission's API. This\n  should be of the format ``FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME E_MAIL``.\n\nData Locations\n--------------\n\n**finagg**'s root path, HTTP cache path, and database path are all configurable\nthrough environment variables. By default, all data related to **finagg** is put\nin a ``./findata`` directory relative to a root directory. You can change these\nlocations by modifying the respective environment variables:\n\n* ``FINAGG_ROOT_PATH`` points to the parent directory of the ``./findata`` directory.\n  Defaults to your current working directory.\n* ``FINAGG_HTTP_CACHE_PATH`` points to the HTTP requests cache SQLite storage.\n  Defaults to ``./findata/http_cache.sqlite``.\n* ``FINAGG_DATABASE_URL`` points to the **finagg** data storage. Defaults to\n  ``./findata/finagg.sqlite``.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* `pandas`_ for fast, flexible, and expressive representations of relational data.\n* `requests`_ for HTTP requests to 3rd party APIs.\n* `requests-cache`_ for caching HTTP requests to avoid getting throttled by 3rd party API servers.\n* `SQLAlchemy`_ for a SQL Python interface.\n* `yfinance`_ for historical stock data from Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAPI References\n==============\n\n* The `BEA API`_ and the `BEA API key registration link`_.\n* The `FRED API`_ and the `FRED API key registration link`_.\n* The `SEC API`_.\n\nRelated Projects\n================\n\n* `FinRL`_ is a collection of financial reinforcement learning environments and tools.\n* `fredapi`_ is an implementation of the FRED API.\n* `OpenBBTerminal`_ an open-source version of the Bloomberg Terminal.\n* `sec-edgar`_ is an implementation of a file-based SEC EDGAR parser.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n==========================\n\nWhere should I start?\n---------------------\n\nAggregate some data, create some analysis notebooks, or create some RL\nenvironments using the implemented data features and SQL tables. This\nproject was originally created to make RL environments for financial\napplications but has since focused its purpose to just aggregating financial\ndata and features. That being said, all the implemented features are\ndefined in such a way to make it very easy to develop financial AI/ML,\nso we encourage you to do just that!\n\nWhat Python versions are supported?\n-----------------------------------\n\nPython 3.10 and up are supported. We don't plan on supporting lower versions\nbecause 3.10 introduces some nice quality of life updates that are used\nthroughout the package.\n\nWhat operating systems are supported?\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe package is developed and tested on both Linux and Windows, but we recommend\nusing Linux or WSL in practice. The package performs a good amount of I/O and\ninterprocess operations that could result in a noticeable performance\ndegradation on Windows.\n\n.. _`BEA API`: https://apps.bea.gov/api/signup/\n.. _`BEA API key registration link`: https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/\n.. _`BEA API site`: https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/\n.. _`FinRL`: https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL\n.. _`FRED API`: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/\n.. _`FRED API key registration link`: https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/login/secure/\n.. _`FRED API site`: https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/login/secure/\n.. _`fredapi`: https://github.com/mortada/fredapi\n.. _`OpenBBTerminal`: https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal\n.. _`pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n.. _`requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _`requests-cache`: https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n.. _`SEC API`: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation\n.. _`sec-edgar`: https://github.com/sec-edgar/sec-edgar\n.. _`SQLAlchemy`: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n.. _`yfinance`: https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance\n",
