    "description": "# NetCov\nNetCov is an open-source tool that can be used with [Batfish](https://github.com/batfish/batfish) to analyze test coverage for network configurations. Given a set of Batfish queries, it analyzes which lines of configurations has/has not been covered. The result can be used to assess the rigorousness of the test suite and help discover the blind spots. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12870.pdf) for technical details.\n\n\nNetCov is written in Python and can be used in concert with [pybatfish](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html), Batfish's Python API.\n\n[<img src=\"screenshot_demo_video.png\"  width=\"500\">](https://youtube.com/video/FcBD2LhxqOQ)\n\n## Features\n\nNetCov supports coverage tracking for the following [Batfish questions](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/questions.html):\n\n- Reachability test via [traceroute](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/forwarding.html#Traceroute) question\n- Routing policy evaluation via [testRoutePolicies](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingProtocols.html#Test-Route-Policies) question\n- Direct inspection of routing tables via [routes](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#Routes) and [bgpRib](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#BGP-RIB) questions\n\n\nNetCov supports configuration syntax of the following vendors:\n\n|                    | Interface          | BGP neighbor       | Routing Policy     | Prefix list        | Community list     | As-path list       |\n|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Cisco              | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Juniper            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Arista             | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Palo Alto Networks | :heavy_check_mark: |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| SONiC              |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n\n\nIf youâ€™d like support for additional [vendors](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_devices.html) (which are supported by Batfish but unsupported by NetCov) or currently-unsupported configuration features, let us know via [GitHub issue](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/issues). We'll try to add support, and it would help if you share a configuration example. You may want to use an [anonymizer](https://github.com/intentionet/netconan) before sharing.\n\nNetCov reports configuration coverage as the percentage of configuration lines that are covered, such as:\n\n<img src=\"screenshot_aggregate.png\"  width=\"500\">\n\nNetCov can also report fine-grained coverage results as colored annotations on source configurations (lines in blue are covered, lines in red are not covered):\n\n<img src=\"screenshot_annotation.png\"  width=\"500\">\n\nYou can find an example of the coverage report [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/main/examples/fattree4/coverage/HTML_REPORT/index.html).\n\n\n\n\n## Installing NetCov\nInstall NetCov using `pip`. A virtual environment and Python version 3.7 is recommended.\n```sh\n$ pip install netcov\n```\n\nNetCov leverages [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate HTML report. If you would like to use this feature, install LCOV using Homebrew (MacOS) or apt (Ubuntu):\n\nInstall `lcov` on MacOS using Homebrew:\n```sh\n$ brew install lcov\n```\nInstall `lcov` on Ubuntu using apt:\n```sh\n$ sudo apt install lcov\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Usage\nNetCov can be used seamlessly with `pybatfish`. It provides a hooked version of pybatfish APIs that automatically tracks coverage during the execution of supported pybatfish questions. \n\n### Using NetCov for an existing pybatfish script/notebook\n\nIt takes only two simple steps to measure coverage for your existing pybatfish scripts/notebooks.\n\n1. For import, replace pybatfish client session with the one provided by NetCov:\n```python\n#from pybatfish.client.session import Session\nfrom netcov import NetCovSession as Session\n```\n2. Generate coverage results at the end of your script. To print coverage metrics to the console, use `bf.cov.result()`. To generate HTML report, use `bf.cov.html_report()`.\n\n### Use NetCov for a new pybatfish script/notebook \n\nWe provide a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcBD2LhxqOQ) and an [example](examples/demo.ipynb) to help you get started. If you are new to pybatfish, we recommend reading the [pybatfish doc](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html) first. \n\n\n### Advanced\n\nSometimes not all information retrieved by Batfish questions are meant to be tested, for example, when you retrieve all RIB entries but only assert on a subset of them. To help NetCov model coverage more accurately, you can pause coverage tracking and add tested information use a NetCov API:\n```\n# pause coverage tracking to avoid over-estimation\nbf.cov.pause()\nroutes = bf.q.routes(nodes=\"edge-0000\").answer().frame()\nbf.cov.resume()\n\n# filter RIB entries to test\ntested = routes[routes[\"Network\"] == '0.0.0.0/0'].head(1)\n\n# add tested route to coverage trace\nbf.cov.add_tested_routes(tested)\n```\n\n`bf.cov.result()` prints coverage metrics using `logging` module and writes to `stderr` by default. To save the coverage report to file, you can customize logger by:\n```python\nimport logging\nfh = logging.FileHandler('cov.log')\nlogging.getLogger('netcov').addHandler(fh)\n```\n\n## References\n```\n@article{netcov,\n  title={Test Coverage for Network Configurations},\n  author={Xu, Xieyang and Deng, Weixin and Beckett, Ryan and Mahajan, Ratul and Walker, David},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.12870},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n",
