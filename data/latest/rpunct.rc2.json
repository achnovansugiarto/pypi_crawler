    "description": "# ✏️ rpunct - Restore Punctuation\n[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-crayons.svg)]()\n\nThis repo contains code for Punctuation restoration.\n\nThis package is intended for direct use as a punctuation restoration model for the general English language. Alternatively, you can use this for further fine-tuning on domain-specific texts for punctuation restoration tasks.\nIt uses HuggingFace's `bert-base-uncased` model weights that have been fine-tuned for Punctuation restoration.\n\nPunctuation restoration works on arbitrarily large text.\nAnd uses GPU if it's available otherwise will default to CPU.\n\nList of punctuations we restore:\n* Upper-casing\n* Period: **.**  \n* Exclamation: **!** \n* Question Mark: **?** \n* Comma:  **,** \n* Colon:  **:** \n* Semi-colon: **;** \n* Apostrophe: **'** \n* Dash: **-** \n\n---------------------------\n## 🚀 Usage\n**Below is a quick way to get up and running with the model.**\n1. First, install the package.\n```bash\npip install rpunct\n```\n2. Sample python code.\n```python\nfrom rpunct import RestorePuncts\n# The default language is 'english'\nrpunct = RestorePuncts()\nrpunct.punctuate(\"\"\"in 2018 cornell researchers built a high-powered detector that in combination with an algorithm-driven process called ptychography set a world record\nby tripling the resolution of a state-of-the-art electron microscope as successful as it was that approach had a weakness it only worked with ultrathin samples that were\na few atoms thick anything thicker would cause the electrons to scatter in ways that could not be disentangled now a team again led by david muller the samuel b eckert\nprofessor of engineering has bested its own record by a factor of two with an electron microscope pixel array detector empad that incorporates even more sophisticated\n3d reconstruction algorithms the resolution is so fine-tuned the only blurring that remains is the thermal jiggling of the atoms themselves\"\"\")\n# Outputs the following:\n# In 2018, Cornell researchers built a high-powered detector that, in combination with an algorithm-driven process called Ptychography, set a world record by tripling the\n# resolution of a state-of-the-art electron microscope. As successful as it was, that approach had a weakness. It only worked with ultrathin samples that were a few atoms\n# thick. Anything thicker would cause the electrons to scatter in ways that could not be disentangled. Now, a team again led by David Muller, the Samuel B. \n# Eckert Professor of Engineering, has bested its own record by a factor of two with an Electron microscope pixel array detector empad that incorporates even more\n# sophisticated 3d reconstruction algorithms. The resolution is so fine-tuned the only blurring that remains is the thermal jiggling of the atoms themselves.\n```\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n## 🎯 Accuracy\nHere is the number of product reviews we used for finetuning the model:\n\n| Language | Number of text samples|\n| -------- | ----------------- |\n| English  | 560,000           |\n\nWe found the best convergence around _**3 epochs**_, which is what presented here and available via a download.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe fine-tuned model obtained the following accuracy on 45,990 held-out text samples:\n\n| Accuracy | Overall F1 | Eval Support |\n| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| 91%  | 90%                 | 45,990\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n## 💻🎯 Further Fine-Tuning\n\nTo start fine-tuning or training please look into `training/train.py` file.\nRunning `python training/train.py` will replicate the results of this model.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n## ☕ Contact \nContact [Daulet Nurmanbetov](daulet.nurmanbetov@gmail.com) for questions, feedback and/or requests for similar models.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n",
