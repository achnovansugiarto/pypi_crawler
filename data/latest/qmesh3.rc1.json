    "description": "qmesh3\n=======\n\nNote: qmesh3 has been created as a temporary solution to allow qmesh to be installed again using pip to facilitate users access until the original qmesh updates are released.\n\nqmesh is a software package for creating high-quality meshes using `QGIS <https://www.qgis.org>`_ and `Gmsh <https://geuz.org/gmsh>`_.\nThe meshes can be used in finite element numerical models such as `TELEMAC <http://www.opentelemac.org>`_, `Fluidity <https://www.fluidity-project.org>`_ and `Thetis <https://thetisproject.org/>`_.\nFor more information please visit the project `website <https://www.qmesh.org>`_.\n\n\n\nDevelopment, Maintenance and Licence\n------------------------------------\n\nqmesh was developed and is maintained by `Alexandros Avdis <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2695-3358>`_ and `Jon Hill  <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1340-4373>`_.\nPlease see file `AUTHORS.md <https://bitbucket.org/qmesh-developers/qmesh-containers/raw/HEAD/AUTHORS.md>`_ for more information.\n\nqmesh is an open-source project distributed under the GNU General Public Licence v3 (`GPL v3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_).\nThe file `LICENCE <https://bitbucket.org/qmesh-developers/qmesh-containers/raw/HEAD/LICENSE>`_ contains a complete copy of the licence.\n\nThe source code is freely available to download and adapt, under the conditions stated in the `LICENCE <https://bitbucket.org/qmesh-developers/qmesh-containers/raw/HEAD/LICENSE>`_ file.\nHowever, we follow a closed-development approach, where maintenance and development is carried out by the package originators.\nWe have opted for this approach to limit the resources needed for development: A larger development team necessitates larger management structures and significant CI/CD expenditure.\nLarger management structures will absorb time intended for other exciting and useful research.\nCI/CD expenditure could threaten our aim to offer a focused package, at no monetary costs to the users.\n\n\n\nDocumentation \n---------------\n\nYou can access relevant documentation through the following avenues:\n\n* The `qmesh website <https://www.qmesh.org>`_.\n* The `qmesh synoptic manual <https://qmesh-synoptic-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.",
