For example, your system has speakers attached, you're not using\n  headphones, your microphone is picking up the sound coming from the speakers\n  and echoing it back out to everyone else on the conference call! \n\n  The **Pulseaudio** echo cancellation module can also perform noise suppression,\n  and **Pamic** makes use of that when in echo cancellation mode. It's not\n  quite as capable as the freestanding noise suppression, but it saves the\n  overhead of using two separate modules.\n\n- Standalone noise suppression\n\n  Standalone noise suppression mode is for when you are using headphones, but\n  your microphone is picking up unwanted background noise. In my case this is\n  my laptop's fan, but it's also good for office hubbub, crowds, construction,\n  planes, trains, automobiles...\n\n  This mode requires an extra library (librnnoise) to be installed. See below for details.\n\n**Pamic**'s changes are not persistent by default. Configure the autostart feature in the `Preferences` dialogue if you want the changes to persist across reboots.\n\n## Installation \n\nRun the following command:\n\n\tpip3 install pamic\n\nDepending on your Linux distribution, you may need to use `pip` rather than `pip3`. (`python3 -m pip install pamic` or `python -m pip install pamic` are also options here.)\n\nEcho cancellation is performed by a standard **Pulseaudio** module, so if you're running the latest version of **Pulseaudio** that should be covered.\n\nNote: I've only tested **Pamic** on **Pulseaudio** version 13.0. If you're using a different version, please let me know how it goes.\n\n### Installing librnnoise\n\nThis is only necessary for standalone noise supression - i.e when you're using headphones rather than speakers.\n\nFor standalone noise suppression **Pamic** makes use of the marvellous https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice\n\nDownload the latest `linux_rnnoise_bin_x64.tar.gz` tarball from https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice/releases/\n\nExtract `librnnoise_ladspa.so` and place it in `/usr/local/lib/`:\n\n\ttar xf ~/Downloads/linux_rnnoise_bin_x64.tar.gz bin/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so\n\tsudo mv librnnoise_ladspa.so /usr/local/lib/\n\n## Using **Pamic**\n\n1. Launch **Pamic**'s GUI. At a terminal run:\n\n\t\tpamicg\n\n\tNote: **Pamic** is made up of two components, the GUI `pamicg`, and the script `pamic`. (For more information on the script see [README_SCRIPT.md](README_SCRIPT.md).)\n\n\t![Pamic's main window](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/raw/master/img/pamicg_main_window.png)\n\n2. Select which mode you wish to use: `Echo Cancellation` or `Noise Suppression`. (The latter is only available if `librnnoise` is installed. See above.)\n\n3. Now select the devices you want to use from the drop down box(es). In `Echo Cancellation` mode select the source (microphone) and sink (sound output device). In `Noise Suppression` mode you can only select a source (microphone).\n\n4. And finally, click the `Apply` button.\n\nAll being well, that should be it. **Pamic** should be working. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if not.\n\nSee also [Configuring individual applications](#configuring-individual-applications) below.\n\n### Unloading **Pamic**\n\nOnce loaded a **Pamic** configuration will remain active until **Pulseaudio** is told to unload the modules, or is stopped. \n\nTo unload an active configuration, click on the down arrow to the right of the `Apply` button and select `Unload`.\n\n### Configuring **Pamic**\n\n![Pamic's Preferences Dialogue](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/raw/master/img/pamicg_preferences.png)\n\nPamic has the following configuration options available in the `Preferences` dialogue:\n\n* Force unload if already active\n\n\tIf this box is ticked, **Pamic** will unload any existing configuration before applying the new one. If the box is not ticked, **Pamic** will not apply the new configuration if there is one already loaded.\n\n\tThis is on by default.\n\n* Display monitor devices\n\n\tIn most instances the **Pulseaudio** monitor devices will not be of interest, so they are not displayed unless this box is ticked. Which it isn't by default.\n\n* Display device names\n\n\tThe human readable device descriptions are always displayed.\n\n\tIn most instances the **Pulseaudio** device names will not be of interest, so they are not displayed unless this box is ticked. Which it isn't by default.\n\n* Autostart\n\n\tThe following tasks can be automatically started when you login:\n\n\t* Pamic\n\n\t\tReinstate the last applied **Pamic** configuration\n\n\t* Pamic GUI\n\n\t\tStart the **Pamic** GUI\n\n\tThese two are independent options, you can have one, the other, both, or neither.\n\n---\n\n### Configuring individual applications\n\nOnce **Pamic** has configured its new virtual devices, any freshly started applications should use **pamic virtual speaker** as their sound output device. \n\nYou may still need to change the routing for applications which are already connected to a different output device, or for applications which have been configured to use a specific output.\n\nI usually use [pavucontrol](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) to control which app uses what output. If you're using **Pulseaudio**, **pavucontrol** (or something similar) is probably already installed. \n\n![Change output (sink) in pavucontrol](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/raw/master/img/pavucontrol_select_sink.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Using **Pamic** with **PulseEffects**\n\n[PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects) makes it a simple matter to extensively tweak the sound coming through PulseAudio.\n\nInstall it via your usual package management tool (e.g. `sudo apt install pulseeffects`).\n\nI use **PulseEffects** to boost bass, add some [audio excitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exciter_(effect)), and [fettle](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fettle#Verb) the stereo image.\n\nThe gotcha here is that **Pamic**'s **Echo-Cancel Sink Stream** *must* be blacklisted, otherwise **Pulseaudio** will detect a loop and there'll be only silence.\n\n1. In **PulseEffects**'s main tab...\n2. select **Applications**...\n3. find the **Echo-Cancel Sink Stream** item and...\n4. click its **Blacklist** button.\n5. Restart **PulseEffects**\n\n(**Pamic** and **PulseEffects** must both be running of course.)\n\n![Blacklist 'Echo-Cancel Sink Stream'](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/raw/master/img/pulseeffects_blacklist_echo_cancel_sink_stream.jpg)\n\n*[This image is of PulseEffects 4.8.0, using some GTK theme or other, and displayed in AwesomeWM. YMWVðŸ˜„]*\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### **Pulseaudio** issues\n\n**Pulseaudio** can get its knickers in a twist. My setup is more complicated than the average in that my sound output device is a remote connexion to **Pulseaudio** running on a different computer, but I find that restarting **Pulseaudio** *and any streams using it*, usually solves most problems.\n\nI do this by running:\n\n\tpkill pulseaudio\n\n**Pulseaudio** automatically restarts.\n\nThe most common exception to this resolving a problem for me has been when **Pulseaudio** chooses to alternate between the two physical outputs on a device after **Pulseaudio** and the device have been restarted. I click **Pamic**'s `Refresh` button, select the new device, click `Apply`, and I'm back up and running. (I should probably try to force one or other of the physical outputs to always be used, but it only happens infrequently.)\n\n### Autostart not working\n\nIf like me you're using a window manager that doesn't handle the common autostart mechanism, you can do the following. After making changes in `Preferences` you can see how **Pamic** has configured the autostart file, and use that as a model in whatever mechanism you do have access to. Run:\n\n\tsed -n 's/^Exec=\\(.\\+\\)/\\1/p' ~/.config/autostart/pamic.desktop\n\n### AOB\n\nI'm expecting other problems to surface once **Pamic** is running on different **Pulseaudio** configurations. Please submit any [issues](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/issues), and if you have solutions, please post them too :)\n\n\n## Suggestions/problems/solutions?\n\nPlease open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/eBardie/pamic/-/issues).\n\n\n## Ingredients not already mentioned\n\nMicrophone icon from [free-icon-download.com](http://free-icon-download.com/modules/PDdownloads/singlefile.php?cid=17&lid=67).\n\n\n",
