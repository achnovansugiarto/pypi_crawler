There are many configuration options related to recording maintenance that are only available in the configuration file.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n## Disk Space Reporting\n\n### \"I want to see how much space is being used by my storage devices.\"\n\nIf not told to do anything else, the monitor will simply report disk space utilization every 10 minutes for all HDHomeRun storage devices found on the network.\n\n```\n$ hdhr_monitor_disk_space\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,967 [HDHomeRun SCRIBE QUATRO 12345678] Total: 999.71 GB; Used: 402.27 GB (40.2%); Free: 597.45 GB (59.8%)\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,983 [HDHomeRun RECORD 192.168.1.100:43206] Total: 1.07 TB; Used: 218.65 GB (20.4%); Free: 854.56 GB (79.6%)\n```\n\n## Disk Space Maintenance\n\n### \"I want to make sure that my storage devices do not fill up.\"\n\nTell the monitor the amount of free space to maintain, either by percentage (`-p/--percent-free`) or absolute gigabytes (`-g/--gigabytes-free`), and it will delete a recording according to the [delete policy](#space-maintenance-delete-policies) when that amount is no longer free.\n\n```\n$ hdhr_monitor_disk_space --gigabytes-free 10\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,967 [HDHomeRun SCRIBE QUATRO 12345678] Total: 999.71 GB; Used: 402.27 GB (40.2%); Free: 597.45 GB (59.8%); Minimum Free: 10.00 GB (1.0%)\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,983 [HDHomeRun RECORD 192.168.1.100:43206] Total: 1.07 TB; Used: 218.65 GB (20.4%); Free: 854.56 GB (79.6%); Minimum Free: 10.00 GB (0.9%)\n```\n\nWhenever a recording is deleted, it is reported, along with the reason.\n\n```\n2020-05-01 23:53:50,637 [HDHomeRun SCRIBE QUATRO 12345678] Deleting \"Keeping Up Appearances\" recorded Sun Jul 28 22:30:00 2019 to free space\n```\n\n### \"I want to make sure that my storage devices do not fill up, but I want to use different settings for each device.\"\n\nThe configuration file can be used for this. If one device needs to maintain 10GB free, and the other needs to maintain 25% free, there are a few options.\n\n#### Option 1: Set 10GB as the default and override one device with 25%.\n\n```\n[DEFAULT]\ngigabytes_free: 10\n\n[device:192.168.1.100]\n# Override the default\ngigabytes_free:\npercent_free: 25\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Configure each device individually.\n\n```\n[device:12345678]\ngigabytes_free: 10\n\n[device:192.168.1.100]\npercent_free: 25\n```\n\nIn either case above, if the configuration file is named /etc/hdhr_disk_space_monitor.conf, then the following would get it started:\n\n```\n$ hdhr_monitor_disk_space --conf-file /etc/hdhr_disk_space_monitor.conf\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,967 [HDHomeRun SCRIBE QUATRO 12345678] Total: 999.71 GB; Used: 402.27 GB (40.2%); Free: 597.45 GB (59.8%); Minimum Free: 10.00 GB (1.0%)\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,983 [HDHomeRun RECORD 192.168.1.100] Total: 1.07 TB; Used: 218.65 GB (20.4%); Free: 854.56 GB (79.6%); Minimum Free: 267.50 GB (25.0%)\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Independent processes without configuration file.\n\n```\n$ hdhr_monitor_disk_space --device-id 12345678 --gigabytes-free 10\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,967 [HDHomeRun SCRIBE QUATRO 12345678] Total: 999.71 GB; Used: 402.27 GB (40.2%); Free: 597.45 GB (59.8%); Minimum Free: 10.00 GB (1.0%)\n```\n\n```\n$ hdhr_monitor_disk_space --device-id 192.168.1.100 --percent-free 25\n2020-06-19 22:08:51,983 [HDHomeRun RECORD 192.168.1.100] Total: 1.07 TB; Used: 218.65 GB (20.4%); Free: 854.56 GB (79.6%); Minimum Free: 267.50 GB (25.0%)\n```\n\n## Recording Maintenance\n\nRecording maintenance is configured entirely in the configuration file. See the example configuration file for a description of all options. The recordings are maintained as a whole across all storage devices, so it's best **not** to split this across multiple processes as in Option 3 above.\n\n### \"I want 'news' category recordings to be deleted after 2 days, 'sport' category recordings to be protected from any automatic deletion, and no more than 5 episodes of 'The Masked Singer'.\n\n```\n[category:news]\nmax_age_days: 2\n\n[category:sport]\nprotected: yes\n\n[series:The Masked Singer]\nmax_episodes: 5\n```\n\n# General Configuration\n\n## Device Discovery/Selection\n\n```\n--device discover|device_id|ip_address|hostname ...\n```\n\nEach instance of the monitor can monitor one or several devices. By default, it will discover all storage devices on the network and monitor/maintain them all according to the options and configuration provided. Optionally, specific device IDs, IP addresses, and/or hostnames can be passed to the monitor, and it will only monitor/maintain those.\n\n## Space Maintenance Delete Policies\n\n```\n--delete-policy {age,category}\n```\n\nThere are 2 delete policies that can be applied to select a recording to be deleted to maintain the free space minimum.\n\n* **Age** - (default) The oldest recording is selected\n* **Category** - Recordings are sorted first by category, then by age within category. The oldest recording in the least important category is selected. The categories, in order of increasing importance are:\n\n  * News\n  * Series\n  * Sports\n  * Movies\n  * Specials\n\nThat category order can be altered by modifying the `delete_order` setting in the configuration file.\n\n## Watched Recordings\n\n```\n--watched-first\n--watched-offset SECONDS\n```\n\nThe delete policies described above do not take into account whether recordings have been watched or not. To have watched recordings deleted first, before the selected delete policy comes into effect, use the `--watched-first` option.\n\nA recording is considered to be watched if there are fewer than 3 minutes remaining to be watched. This can be modified using the `--watched-offset` option.\n\n## Delete Protection\n\nIn the configuration file, any category or specific series can have `protected: yes` set. This will cause all episodes of that category or series to be protected from deletion by this program. This setting has no effect on the ability to delete recordings in the DVR UI,\n\nAlso, any recording that is currently playing or is in the process of being recorded is automatically protected from deletion.\n\n## Listing Recordings\n\n```\n--list-recordings\n```\n\nThis option is available so that, in combination with `--delete-policy` and `--watched-first`, recordings can be listed in the order that they would be deleted. This can help determine which delete policy is preferred.\n\nNo space check or deletion happens when this option is used.\n\nAn alternative to this is to run with the `-n/--dry-run` argument. This will prevent the program from actually deleting anything, while showing what it would delete.\n\n## Listing Series\n\n```\n--list-series\n```\n\nList recorded series in order of increasing space utilization, along with the amount of space utilized and number of episodes. If watched recordings exist, the amount of space they occupy will also be printed.\n\nNo space check or deletion happens when this option is used.\n\n# Command-Line Usage\n\n```\nusage: hdhr_disk_space_monitor [-h]\n                               [-d DEVICE_ID|IP|HOSTNAME [DEVICE_ID|IP|HOSTNAME ...]]\n                               [-f FILE] [-i SECONDS] [-c NUMBER]\n                               [-g GIGABYTES | -p PERCENT] [-s {age,category}]\n                               [-w] [-o SECONDS] [-l] [-r] [-n] [-V] [-q | -v]\n\nMonitor disk space utilization of HDHomeRun SCRIBE, SERVIO, and RECORD\ndevices.

The configuration file\n                        supports overriding the built-in defaults, per-device\n                        settings, as well as some settings not available on\n                        the command-line. See example. Options given on the\n                        command-line override those in the configuration file.\n  -i SECONDS, --interval SECONDS\n                        Number of seconds between space utilization reports.\n                        Default is 600. This can be set per-device in the\n                        configuration file.\n  -c NUMBER, --count NUMBER\n                        Number of space utilization reports to print before\n                        stopping. Default is to continue forever. To disable\n                        regular reports, set this to zero (0). This can be set\n                        per-device in the configuration file.\n  -g GIGABYTES, --gigabytes-free GIGABYTES\n                        Minimum number of gigabytes (GB) of free disk space to\n                        maintain. Causes a maintenance cycle to be run which\n                        will delete recordings when the minimum amount of free\n                        space is not available. Cannot be used in combination\n                        with -p/--percent-free. This can be set per-device in\n                        the configuration file.\n  -p PERCENT, --percent-free PERCENT\n                        Minimum percentage of free disk space to maintain.\n                        Causes a maintenance cycle to be run which will delete\n                        recordings when the minimum amount of free space is\n                        not available. Cannot be used in combination with\n                        -g/--gigabytes-free. This can be set per-device in the\n                        configuration file.\n  -s {age,category}, --delete-policy {age,category}\n                        Delete policy / sort method. Determines how recordings\n                        are sorted when selecting one to delete to maintain\n                        free disk space. \"age\" sorts only on the age of the\n                        recordings and selects the oldest for deletion.\n                        \"category\" sorts first by category ['news', 'series',\n                        'sport', 'movie', 'special'], then by age. Category\n                        order can be customized in the configuration file. Use\n                        in combination with -l/--list-recordings to determine\n                        which policy is preferred. Default is \"age\".\n  -w, --watched-first   Delete watched recordings first, before applying the\n                        selected delete policy. Default is to apply the\n                        selected delete policy without regard to whether\n                        recordings are watched or not. This can be set per-\n                        category in the configuration file.\n  -o SECONDS, --watched-offset SECONDS\n                        Threshold for considering a recording \"watched\". This\n                        is the number of seconds remaining to be watched at\n                        the end of a recording below which it is considered\n                        \"watched\". Default is 180 seconds (3 minutes). This\n                        can be set per-category in the configuration file.\n  -l, --list-recordings\n                        List recordings in the order that they would be\n                        deleted to maintain free disk space, and then exit.\n                        Use in combination with -s/--delete-policy and\n                        -w/--watched-first to determine which policy is\n                        preferred.\n  -r, --list-series     List recorded series in order of increasing space\n                        utilization, along with the amount of space utilized,\n                        and then exit. If watched recordings exist, the amount\n                        of space they occupy will also be printed.\n  -n, --dry-run         Run without actually deleting any recordings. Log\n                        messages will indicate that recordings are being\n                        deleted, but none will actually be deleted.\n  -V, --version         Show version number and exit.\n  -q, --quiet           Suppress all messages except errors.\n  -v, --verbose         Print more informational messages. Free space and\n                        delete messages are printed by default.\n```\n\n\n",
