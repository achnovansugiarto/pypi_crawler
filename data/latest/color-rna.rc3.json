    "description": "# Color_RNA\n\n##Beta Version##\n\nThis package uses web scraping to generate custom colored images of RNA secondary structures by using forna[1].\nCurrently supports 5 colors, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Pink. \nFurther color support to be added in the future.\n\nHow to use:\nSuitable chromedriver.exe should be downloaded from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads\nWe recommend adding chromedriver.exe to the working path but you can place it elsewhere and supply its path (see instructions below).\n* Internet connection and Chrome browser are required\n\nThe function that you are going to use is called \"create_image\".\nIt's inputs are:\n##\nsequence (str): The sequence to be drawn\nAccepts characters:\n\"A\", \"a\", \"T\", \"t\", \"G\", \"g\", \"C\", \"c\", \"U\", \"u\"\nAccording to nitrogenous bases.\n\n##\nstructure (str): The secondary structure to be drawn\nAccepts characters:\n\".\" - Unbound base\n\"(\" - Bound base - must be accompanied by \")\" later in the sequence\n\")\" - Bound base - first \")\" is bound to first \"(\", etc. \n\"[\", \"]\" - Pseudoknots connection, works as \"(\" and \")\"\n\n##\ncolors_string (str): Position of wanted colors in the image.\nFor images with no colors, supply an empty string. \nAccepts charcters:\n\"r\" - Red\n\"g\" - Green\n\"b\" - Blue\n\"p\" - Pink\n\"y\" - yellow\n\" \" - White\n\n\n## \nOptional: image_path (str): The path and image name in which the user wants the image to be saved.\nDefault: \"RNA_image.png\"\nIf not supplied, the image will be saved in the working path as \"RNA_image.png\".\n\n##\nOptional: pseudoknots_strength (str): the strength of the pseudoknots.\nIf not supplied, the default is weak pseudoknots.\nElse, strong pseudoknots will be enabled.\n\n## \nOptional: driver_path (str): The path in which \"chromedriver.exe\" is present.\nIf not supplied, the function expects chromedriver.exe to be in working path.\nIf the user wants, they can save chromedriver.exe elsewhere and supply the path.\n\nExample of use:\nAfter installation and chromedriver download, import package and use function as follows:\nfrom color_rna import Color_RNA\n\nIn this example, we wish to draw:\n*sequence - \"ATGCCGTA\"\n*structue - \"(......)\"\n*colors - positions 1,2 are red, positions 3-6 are yellow and position 6,7 are green\n*image to be saved at working path with \"Example.png\" as its name.\n*pseudoknots bonds are weak (default)\n*chromedriver.exe is saved on the desktop and not in working path.\nThe code should look like:\nColor_RNA.create_image(\"ATGCCGTA\", \"(......)\", \"rryyyygg\", image_path = \"Exapmle.png\", driver_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\chromedriver\")\n\n[1] Kerpedjiev P, Hammer S, Hofacker IL (2015).
