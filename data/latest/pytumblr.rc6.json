When using these types there are a few defaults that are able to be used with any post type.\n\nThe default supported types are described below.\n\n-  **state** - a string, the state of the post. Supported types are *published*, *draft*, *queue*, *private*\n-  **tags** - a list, a list of strings that you want tagged on the post. eg: [\"testing\", \"magic\", \"1\"]\n-  **tweet** - a string, the string of the customized tweet you want. eg: \"Man I love my mega awesome post!\"\n-  **date** - a string, the customized GMT that you want\n-  **format** - a string, the format that your post is in.

You'll be able to supply to the post any of the options given above for updates.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    client.edit_post(blogName, id=post_id, type=\"text\", title=\"Updated\")\n    client.edit_post(blogName, id=post_id, type=\"photo\", data=\"/Users/johnb/mega/awesome.jpg\")\n\nReblogging a Post\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nReblogging a post just requires knowing the post id and the reblog key, which is supplied in the JSON of any post object.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    client.reblog(blogName, id=125356, reblog_key=\"reblog_key\")\n\nDeleting a post\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nDeleting just requires that you own the post and have the post id\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    client.delete_post(blogName, 123456) # Deletes your post :(\n\nA note on tags: When passing tags, as params, please pass them as a list (not a comma-separated string):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    client.create_text(blogName, tags=['hello', 'world'], ...)\n\nGetting notes for a post\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn order to get the notes for a post, you need to have the post id and the blog that it is on.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    data = client.notes(blogName, id='123456')\n\nThe results include a timestamp you can use to make future calls.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    data = client.notes(blogName, id='123456', before_timestamp=data[\"_links\"][\"next\"][\"query_params\"][\"before_timestamp\"])\n\n\nTagged Methods\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # get posts with a given tag\n    client.tagged(tag, **params)\n\nUsing the interactive console\n-----------------------------\n\nThis client comes with a nice interactive console to run you through the OAuth process, grab your tokens (and store them for future use).\n\nYou'll need ``pyyaml`` installed to run it, but then it's just:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ python interactive_console.py\n\nand away you go! Tokens are stored in ``~/.tumblr`` and are also shared by other Tumblr API clients like the Ruby client.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nThe tests (and coverage reports) are run with nose, like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python setup.py test\n\nCopyright and license\n=====================\n\nCopyright 2013 Tumblr, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this work except in compliance with the License.
