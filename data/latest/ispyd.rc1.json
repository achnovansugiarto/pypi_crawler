    "description": "The 'ispyd' package provides an in process shell for introspecting a\r\nrunning process. It was primarily intended for investigating running WSGI\r\napplication processes, specifically to determine what a process is doing\r\nwhen it hangs, but has many other features as well. This includes being\r\nable to start an embedded interactive Python interpreter session, set\r\ndebugger probe points to record tracebacks for exceptions and then later\r\nrun 'pdb' in post mortem mode on those exceptions.",
