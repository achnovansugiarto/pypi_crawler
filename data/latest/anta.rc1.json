You can find examples of EOS automation with eAPI in this [repository](https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/arista_eos_automation_with_eAPI).\n\n# Documentation\n\nThe documentation is published on [ANTA package website](https://arista-netdevops-community.github.io/network-test-automation/)\n\n# Contribution guide\n\nContributions are welcome. Please refer to the [contribution guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arista-netdevops-community/network-test-automation/master/docs/contribution.md)\n\n# Credits\n\nThank you to [Angélique Phillipps](https://github.com/aphillipps), [Colin MacGiollaEáin](https://github.com/colinmacgiolla), [Khelil Sator](https://github.com/ksator), [Matthieu Tache](https://github.com/mtache), [Onur Gashi](https://github.com/onurgashi), [Paul Lavelle](https://github.com/paullavelle), [Guillaume Mulocher](https://github.com/gmuloc) and [Thomas Grimonet](https://github.com/titom73) for their contributions and guidances.\n",
