    "description": "# `gnucash-ch-filing`\n\n## Introduction\n\nVery partial implementation of the Companies House Software Filing interface.\nThere is enough support to file company accounts.\n\nThis utility is designed to take a UK company accounts file formatted using\n[`gnucash-ixbrl`](https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-ixbrl) and\nsubmits in accordance with the Software Filing API.\n\n`gnucash-ch-filing` presently understands a small subset of the accounts\nmanagement process, and may be useful for a small business with simple\naccounting affairs. It really is no use to a complex business.\n\n## Status\n\nThis is a command-line utility, which has been tested with the\nSoftware Filing API.\n\n## Credentials\n\nIn order to use this, you need production credentials (presenter ID,\nauthentication value and the company authentication code) for the company\nyou are filing for.\n\nCompanies House documentation:\n- [Software Filing](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house/about-our-services#software-filing)\n- [Developer information](http://xmlgw.companieshouse.gov.uk/SchemaStatus)\n\n## Installing\n\n```\npip3 install git+https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-ch-filing\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nI can't share my test credentials with you, you would need to email\nCompanies House to get some.\n\nYou need to edit the `config.json` file to contain the right details for\nyou.  Check the credentials work by fetching company information:\n\n```\n% ch-filing --get-company-data\n```\n\nCompany accounts should be an iXBRL file which conforms to the CH\naccepted taxonomies.  Once you are ready to file:\n\n```\n% ch-filing --submit-accounts --accounts accts.html\n```\n\nYou get a submission ID in return.  To check the process of the submitted\naccounts:\n```\n% ch-filing --get-submission-status -i S00027\nS00027: PENDING\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nusage: ch-filing [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--state STATE] [--accounts ACCOUNTS]\n                 [--get-company-data] [--submit-accounts]\n                 [--get-submission-status] [--submission-id SUBMISSION_ID]\n\nSubmittion to HMRC Corporation Tax API\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG\n                        Configuration file (default: config.json)\n  --state STATE, -s STATE\n                        Transaction counter state (default: state.json)\n  --accounts ACCOUNTS, -a ACCOUNTS\n                        Company accounts iXBRL file\n  --get-company-data, -C\n                        Get company details, to check the authentication\n  --submit-accounts, -S\n                        Submit company accounts\n  --get-submission-status, -G\n                        Get status of previous filing\n  --submission-id SUBMISSION_ID, -i SUBMISSION_ID\n                        Submission ID of previous filing\n```\n\n# Licences, Compliance, etc.\n\n## Warranty\n\nThis code comes with no warranty whatsoever.  See the [LICENCE](LICENSE) file\nfor details.  Further, I am not an accountant.  It is possible that this code\ncould be useful to you in meeting regulatory reporting requirements for your\nbusiness.  It is also possible that the software could report misleading\ninformation which could land you in a lot of trouble if used for regulatory\npurposes.  Really, you should check with a qualified accountant.\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (C) 2021, Cyberapocalypse Limited\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
