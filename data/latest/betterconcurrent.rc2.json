    "description": "# betterconcurrent\n\nThis is a fork of Python 3.11.2's `concurrent.futures` module, demonstrating some improvements that could be useful to merge to the standard implementation.\nIn short, these features are cooperative multitasking (solving the [deadlock footgun](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)) and fire-and-forget execution of task-parallel computations.\n\nThe changes currently pertain to `ThreadPoolExecutor`. The architecture of `ProcessPoolExecutor` is not trivially amenable to these changes and is left as-is for now.\n\nAll exported types are backwards compatible and will behave the same as `concurrent.futures`, meaning that this package is a safe drop-in replacement.\n\nYou can install this package with\n```\npip install betterconcurrent\n```\n\n## `Future`\n\nFutures are now aware, through a weakref, of the executor that generated them.\n\n### `yield_until_done`\n\nCode running inside a function submitted to an executor can now potentially cooperatively wait for the result of a future on the same executor.\nThis can be done by inserting the yielding expression `yield from future.yield_until_done()`.\nIf the executor is capable of cooperative scheduling, the current function will be paused and its continuation will be rescheduled upon completion of the future.\nIf the executor does not have this capability, the call will block in the same way `future.result()` or `future.exception()` would.\nIn any case, `future.done()` is guaranteed to be `True` after execution resumes from the yielding expression, allowing the user to access the result without further blocking.\n\nThis introduces a new pattern for cooperative multitasking.\nA top-level function `betterconcurrent.yield_until_done` accepts a list of futures and yields execution until all of them are done.\n\n## `ThreadPoolExecutor`\n\n### Cooperative Multitasking\n\n`ThreadPoolExecutor` now supports cooperative multitasking and is compatible with the `yield_until_done` feature!\n\n`concurrent.futures` code that exhibits the [deadlock footgun](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor) can be adjusted to use this feature and never deadlock with `betterconcurrent`. Simply use `yield_until_done` before blocking on the result of any futures and execution will not stall!\nIt should be noted that the footgun is still present in `betterconcurrent` to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n### Fire-and-Forget\n\nWe enable a powerful pattern wherein functions that submit subtasks without any interest in the result can be executed until convergence.\n\n`ThreadPoolExecutor` now has a complement to `shutdown` called `join`.\nWhere `shutdown` would stop the computation in its tracks and prevent it from further unfolding, `join` will block until all tasks – and their subtasks – have completed, even if they continue to unfold when it is called.\n\n#### Example\n\nA search for a particular node in a tree can be parallelized by recursively spawning a subtask for each of the children. We might not care to return the value to the caller, but rather print a message or assign the result to a shared variable.\nSee [tree_search.py](tests/test_tree_search.py) for an example of a parallel tree search!\n\n## To do\n\n- [ ] Achieve full exception-safety. Some unlucky exception firings might cause undefined behavior currently.\n",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.
