    "description": "This Python library was evolved at IronPort Systems and has been provided\nas open source by Cisco Systems under an MIT license.\n\nIntro\n=====\n\nShrapnel is a library for high-performance concurrency.  It uses\ncoroutines to implement user threads on top of either kqueue (FreeBSD,\nOS X) or /dev/epoll (linux), and is written mostly in Pyrex/Cython,\nsupporting both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  It is the culmination of\nabout 8 years of work at IronPort Systems, a provider of high-speed\nmail appliances.  It was open-sourced by Cisco Systems in late 2011.\n\nStatus\n======\n\nApr 18, 2013: I've recently merged in a long chain of branches for several\nimportant features:\n\n * Support for pure-cython servers (branch 'pxdfix')\n * Full DNS resolver implementation (branch 'dns-cache')\n * Updated postgres support (branch 'postgres')\n * Included OpenSSL support\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n * Lightweight threads, event-driven scheduler.\n * Underneath: non-blocking operations on descriptors, like sockets and pipes.\n * On top, synchronous API for straight-line, simple code.\n * Highly scalable - tens or hundreds of thousands of connections/threads.\n * Thread synchronization primitives, like mutexes, semaphores, etc...\n * with_timeout(): wrap any funcall with a timeout.\n * Wait on kqueue events like file/directory changes, signals, processes, etc... [kqueue only]\n * DNS resolver and cache\n * HTTP server and client (plus WebSocket, RFC6455 & hixie-76)\n * Support for TLS via tlslite and openssl (plus NPN for both)\n * other protocols/codecs: ldap, asn1, ftp, mysql, postgres, AMQP.\n * `MIT License`_.\n \nAdvantages\n==========\n\nCompared to other concurrency packages available for Python,\nShrapnel gives you:\n\n * Speed and Efficiency: the entire scheduler, poller, socket layer,\n   synchronization objects, etc... are written in Cython, with an\n   emphasis on performance and low memory usage.\n * Stock Python: Shrapnel works with out-of-the-box CPython [2.X].  No\n   special variants of Python are needed, it will even work with your\n   OS's OEM python installation. So you can use all the external\n   libraries/modules you've come to rely on.\n * No Callbacks: no need to cuisinart your application into a thousand\n   callbacks.  No need to decompose every action into a state\n   machine.  Write simple, performant code now without having to send\n   your programmers to class.\n * Drop to Cython for speed: all the capabilities of the system are\n   available from Cython, so you can e.g. write a server entirely in\n   Cython for speed.  You can interface with external libraries, and\n   do thread switches from Cython or C.  It's even possible to have\n   external C code call back into shrapnel.  This makes it easy to\n   prototype your application in Python, and then push only the hot\n   spots into Cython.\n * Timeouts: Shrapnel provides a general timeout mechanism that can be\n   used to wrap any function call with a timeout.\n * Profiler: Thread-aware profiler generates HTML reports.\n\n\nTutorial\n========\n\nSee http://ironport.github.com/shrapnel/tutorial.html\n\nAPI Documentation\n=================\n\nSee http://ironport.github.com/shrapnel/\n\n.. _MIT License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html\n\n",
