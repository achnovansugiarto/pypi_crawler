The book focuses on the fundamental models of queueing theory as well as advanced models for recent communication systems and networks. It gives an introduction in common methods of performance modeling and analysis of communication systems. These methods form the basis of traffic engineering, teletraffic theory, and system analytical dimensioning tools. The fundamentals of probability theory, stochastic processes, Markov processes, and embedded Markov chains are presented. Basic queueing models are described with applications in communication networks. Advanced methods are presented that have been frequently used in practice, especially discrete-time analysis algorithms, or which go beyond classical performance like quality of experience or energy efficiency. Recent examples of modern communication networks include Software Defined Networking or the Internet of Things. Throughout the book, illustrative examples are used to provide practical experience in performance modeling and analysis.\n\nAn implementation of the models in the book is available as interactive notebooks online. The scripts will help to better understand the impact of parameters on performance characteristics, will avoid common pitfalls in the implementation, and provide means for numerical robust and efficient implementations for researchers in the domain.\n\nWebsite of the book:\n<https://modeling.systems>\n\n##  Copyright Notice\nThe scripts are published under the license: [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nPermission is hereby granted, without written agreement and without license or royalty fees, to use, copy, modify, and distribute this tool and its documentation for any purpose, provided that the copyright notice in its entirety appear in all copies of this tool, and the original source of this tool is acknowledged in any publication that reports research using this tool.
