    "description": "To find out what's new in this version of Fabric, please see `the changelog\n<http://docs.fabfile.org/changes/1.0.1.html>`_.\n\nYou can also install the `in-development version\n<https://github.com/bitprophet/fabric/tarball/master#egg=fabric-dev>`_ using\npip, with `pip install fabric==dev`.\n\n----\n\nFabric is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for\nstreamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems\nadministration tasks.\n\nIt provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell\ncommands (normally or via ``sudo``) and uploading/downloading files, as well as\nauxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or\naborting execution.\n \nTypical use involves creating a Python module containing one or more functions,\nthen executing them via the ``fab`` command-line tool. Below is a small but\ncomplete \"fabfile\" containing a single task::\n\n    from fabric.api import run\n\n    def host_type():\n        run('uname -s')\n\nOnce a task is defined, it may be run on one or more servers, like so::\n\n    $ fab -H localhost,linuxbox host_type\n    [localhost] run: uname -s\n    [localhost] out: Darwin\n    [linuxbox] run: uname -s\n    [linuxbox] out: Linux\n\n    Done.\n    Disconnecting from localhost... done.\n    Disconnecting from linuxbox... done.\n\nIn addition to use via the ``fab`` tool, Fabric's components may be imported\ninto other Python code, providing a Pythonic interface to the SSH protocol\nsuite at a higher level than that provided by e.g. Paramiko (which\nFabric itself leverages.)\n\n\n----\n\nFor more information, please see the Fabric website or execute ``fab --help``.",
