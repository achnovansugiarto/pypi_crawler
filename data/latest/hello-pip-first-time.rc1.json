    "description": "# Hello pip-first-time\n\nBefore you do anything, make sure you create an account oon pypi.org. It's important to constantly share your code and ideas with others as it'll imrpove the quality over time. It's very easy to convince yourself that some piece of code is useful and well written if noone is using it.\n\n## Installing the right packages\n\nBefore you get started I'll assume you've went ahead and downloaded the Python Anaconda distribution\n\n\nThen you want to go\n\n```\nconda create -n hello-pip\nconda install setuptools wheel twine tqdm\n```\n\n* setuptools: will help us setup our package metadata information\n* wheel: is the format for python packages\n* twine: is a utility which will help us upload packages to PyPi \n* tqdm: taqadom in arabic which means progress is a way to track progress bars\n\n## Project Setup\n\nThen setup your directories in the same way as this repo\n* README: Is this document, your chance to pitch your product. Most people will skim this before they read the rest of your code so take particular care in writing it\n* LICENSE: Pick whatever works for your usecase - check out tldrlegal.com if you're not sure what to pick\n* setup.py: Will contain all your package metadata\n* hello-pip: is an executable we need to make runnable by typing ```chmod +x hello-pip```\n\n## Compiling Package\n\nRun ```python setup.py bdist_wheel``` which will create 3 new folders in your directory\n1. Build/\n2. dist/\n3. hello_pip.egg.info/\n\nThe dist folder contains your package in wheel format so if you'd like to run your package locally you can run\n\n```\npip install dist/hello_pip-0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\nYou need to specify your own package name, package version and python version. Just use Python 3 at this point if you can.\n\n## Upload to PyPi\nCreate a file called ```.pyrirc``` and put in your home directory. Then run\n\n```python -m twine upload dist/*```\n\n# Next steps\n1. Build a more complete tutorial, instad of echo, upload a class others can import\n2. Build a package people use and love\n\n\n# References\n* https://dzone.com/articles/executable-package-pip-install\n* https://packaging.python.org/  \n\n",
