Read [more about sparsification](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/user-guide/sparsification).\n\nNeural Magic's DeepSparse is able to integrate into popular deep learning libraries (e.g., Hugging Face, Ultralytics) allowing you to leverage DeepSparse for loading and deploying sparse models with ONNX. \nONNX gives the flexibility to serve your model in a framework-agnostic environment. \nSupport includes [PyTorch,](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) [TensorFlow,](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) [Keras,](https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx) and [many other frameworks](https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools).\n\nDeepSparse is available in two editions: \n1. [**DeepSparse Community**](#installation) is open-source and free for evaluation, research, and non-production use with our [DeepSparse Community License](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/engine-license-agreement/).\n2. [**DeepSparse Enterprise**](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/products/deepsparse-ent) requires a Trial License or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications.\n\n## Features\n\n- 🔌 [DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server)\n- 📜 [DeepSparse Benchmark](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark)\n- 👩‍💻 [NLP and Computer Vision Tasks Supported](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples)\n\n## 🧰 Hardware Support and System Requirements\n\nReview [Supported Hardware for DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/user-guide/deepsparse-engine/hardware-support) to understand system requirements. \nDeepSparse works natively on Linux; Mac and Windows require running Linux in a Docker or virtual machine; it will not run natively on those operating systems.\n\nDeepSparse is tested on Python 3.7-3.10, ONNX 1.5.0-1.12.0, ONNX opset version 11+, and manylinux compliant. \nUsing a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended. \n\n## Installation\n\nInstall DeepSparse Community as follows: \n\n```bash\npip install deepsparse\n```\n\nTo install the DeepSparse Enterprise, trial or inquire about licensing for DeepSparse Enterprise, see the [DeepSparse Enterprise documentation](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/products/deepsparse-ent).\n\n## Features\n\n### 🔌 DeepSparse Server\n\nDeepSparse Server allows you to serve models and pipelines from the terminal. The server runs on top of the popular FastAPI web framework and Uvicorn web server. Install the server using the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install deepsparse[server]\n```\n\n#### Single Model\n\nOnce installed, the following example CLI command is available for running inference with a single BERT model:\n\n```bash\ndeepsparse.server \\\n    task question_answering \\\n    --model_path \"zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\"\n```\n\nTo look up arguments run: `deepsparse.server --help`.\n\n#### Multiple Models\nTo serve multiple models in your deployment you can easily build a `config.yaml`. In the example below, we define two BERT models in our configuration for the question answering task:\n\n```yaml\nnum_cores: 1\nnum_workers: 1\nendpoints:\n    - task: question_answering\n      route: /predict/question_answering/base\n      model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none\n      batch_size: 1\n    - task: question_answering\n      route: /predict/question_answering/pruned_quant\n      model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\n      batch_size: 1\n```\n\nFinally, after your `config.yaml` file is built, run the server with the config file path as an argument:\n```bash\ndeepsparse.server config config.yaml\n```\n\n[Getting Started with DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server) for more info.\n\n### 📜 DeepSparse Benchmark\n\nThe benchmark tool is available on your CLI to run expressive model benchmarks on DeepSparse with minimal parameters.\n\nRun `deepsparse.benchmark -h` to look up arguments:\n\n```shell\ndeepsparse.benchmark [-h] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-shapes INPUT_SHAPES]\n                          [-ncores NUM_CORES] [-s {async,sync}] [-t TIME]\n                          [-nstreams NUM_STREAMS] [-pin {none,core,numa}]\n                          [-q] [-x EXPORT_PATH]\n                          model_path\n\n```\n\n[Getting Started with CLI Benchmarking](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark) includes examples of select inference scenarios: \n- Synchronous (Single-stream) Scenario\n- Asynchronous (Multi-stream) Scenario\n\n\n### 👩‍💻 NLP Inference Example\n\n```python\nfrom deepsparse import Pipeline\n\n# SparseZoo model stub or path to ONNX file\nmodel_path = \"zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\"\n\nqa_pipeline = Pipeline.create(\n    task=\"question-answering\",\n    model_path=model_path,\n)\n\nmy_name = qa_pipeline(question=\"What's my name?\", context=\"My name is Snorlax\")\n```\n\nNLP Tutorials:\n- [Getting Started with Hugging Face Transformers 🤗](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples/huggingface-transformers)\n\nTasks Supported: \n- [Token Classification: Named Entity Recognition](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-named-entity-recognition/)\n- [Text Classification: Multi-Class](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-multi-class-text-classification/)\n- [Text Classification: Binary](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-binary-text-classification/)\n- [Text Classification: Sentiment Analysis](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-sentiment-analysis/)\n- [Question Answering](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-question-answering/)\n\n### 🦉 SparseZoo ONNX vs. Custom ONNX Models\n\nDeepSparse can accept ONNX models from two sources: \n\n- **SparseZoo ONNX**: our open-source collection of sparse models available for download. [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) hosts inference-optimized models, trained on repeatable sparsification recipes using state-of-the-art techniques from [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).\n\n- **Custom ONNX**: your own ONNX model, can be dense or sparse. Plug in your model to compare performance with other solutions.\n\n```bash\n> wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx\nSaving to: ‘mobilenetv2-7.onnx’\n```\n\nCustom ONNX Benchmark example:\n```python\nfrom deepsparse import compile_model\nfrom deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs\nonnx_filepath = \"mobilenetv2-7.onnx\"\nbatch_size = 16\n\n# Generate random sample input\ninputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)\n\n# Compile and run\nengine = compile_model(onnx_filepath, batch_size)\noutputs = engine.run(inputs)\n```\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) includes package APIs along with examples to quickly get started benchmarking and inferencing sparse models.\n\n### Scheduling Single-Stream, Multi-Stream, and Elastic Inference\n\nDeepSparse offers up to three types of inferences based on your use case. Read more details here: [Inference Types](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/source/scheduler.md).\n\n1 ⚡ Single-stream scheduling: the latency/synchronous scenario, requests execute serially. [`default`]\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/single-stream.png\" alt=\"single stream diagram\" />\n\nUse Case: It's highly optimized for minimum per-request latency, using all of the system's resources provided to it on every request it gets.\n\n2 ⚡ Multi-stream scheduling: the throughput/asynchronous scenario, requests execute in parallel.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/multi-stream.png\" alt=\"multi stream diagram\" />\n\nPRO TIP: The most common use cases for the multi-stream scheduler are where parallelism is low with respect to core count, and where requests need to be made asynchronously without time to batch them.\n\n3 ⚡ Elastic scheduling: requests execute in parallel, but not multiplexed on individual NUMA nodes.\n\nUse Case: A workload that might benefit from the elastic scheduler is one in which multiple requests need to be handled simultaneously, but where performance is hindered when those requests have to share an L3 cache.\n\n## Resources\n#### Libraries\n- [DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/)\n\n- [SparseML](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparseml/)\n\n- [SparseZoo](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsezoo/)\n\n- [Sparsify](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsify/)\n\n\n#### Versions\n- [DeepSparse](https://pypi.org/project/deepsparse) | stable\n\n- [DeepSparse-Nightly](https://pypi.org/project/deepsparse-nightly/) | nightly (dev)\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/releases) | releases\n\n#### Info\n\n- [Blog](https://www.neuralmagic.com/blog/) \n\n- [Resources](https://www.neuralmagic.com/resources/)\n\n\n## Community\n\n### Be Part of the Future...
