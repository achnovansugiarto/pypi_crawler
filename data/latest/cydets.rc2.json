Mainz, Germany. 2012.*\n\nThanks again to Simon Pichlmaier for sharing his code and allowing us\nto port and publish the algorithm under a free license.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe probably most extensive description of the algorithm can be found in the\nabovementioned paper. In addition, we have tried to document the single parts of\nthe algorithm as docstrings within the code.\n\nInstallation\n================\n\nIf you have a working Python3 environment, use can pypi to install the latest\nversion.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  pip install cydets\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe algorithm is implemented as a function which takes an array-like data\nstructure as argument.\nResults are returned as a `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ dataframe.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    from cydets.algorithm import detect_cycles\n\n    # create sample data\n    series = pd.Series([0, 1, 0, 0.5, 0, 1, 0, 0.5, 0, 1, 0])\n\n    # detect cycles\n    cycles = detect_cycles(series)\n\nCitation\n========\n\nPlease use our `entry on Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2625698>`_ to refer a specific version\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (C) 2019 oemof developing group\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\nterms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\neither version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\nwithout even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.\nIf not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.",
