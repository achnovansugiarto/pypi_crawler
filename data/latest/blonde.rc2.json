They can neither distinguish document-level improvements in translation quality from sentence-level ones, nor identify the discourse phenomena that cause context-agnostic translations.\n\nBlonDe is proposed to widen the scope of automatic MT evaluation from sentence to the document level. It takes discourse coherence into consideration by categorizing discourse-related spans and calculating the similarity-based F1 measure of categorized spans. \n\nAs shown in the figure, BlonDe is a lot more selective than BLEU for document-level MT \nand shows a larger quality difference between human and machine translations.\n\nIn the BlonDe package, there are:\n- ``BlonDe``: the main metric, combining ``dBlonDe`` with sentence-level measurement\n- ``dBlonDe``: measures the discourse phonomena (``entity``, ``tense``, ``pronoun``, ``discourse markers``)\n- ``BlonDe+``: takes human annotation (annotated ambiguous/ommitted phrases and manually-annotated NER) into consideration\n\n\n### ‚è≥ Installation\n**Python>=3.6 only**\n\nBefore you install ``blonde``, make sure that\nyour `pip`, `setuptools`Ôºå`wheel` and `spacy` are up to date, and ``en_core_web_sm`` is downloaded.\n```sh\npip install -U pip setuptools wheel\npip install -U spacy\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n```\n\nInstall the official Python module from PyPI:\n```sh\npip install blonde\n```\nInstall the latest unstable version from the master branch on Github:\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/EleanorJiang/BlonDe\n```\n\nInstall from the source:\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/EleanorJiang/BlonDe\ncd BlonDe\npip install .\n```\nand you may test your installation by:\n```\npython -m unittest discover\n```\n\n### Usage\nWe provide a command line interface (CLI) of BlonDe as well as a python \nmodule. \nWe provide example inputs under `./example`.\n\n### Command-line Usage\nYou can use it as follows for the simplest usage:\n```sh\nblonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt\n```\n\nTo use human-annotated spans for `BlonDe+`, \nadd `-p` and provide the annotation file path with `-an`, as in:\n```sh\nblonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt -p -an example/an.txt\n```\n\nTo use human-annotated named entities (instead of automatic detected ones), \nadd `-p` and provide the named entity file path with `-ner`, as in:\n```sh\nblonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt -p -ner example/ner.txt\n```\n#### The full list of named arguments:\nGeneral arguments:\n```\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -r REFERENCE [REFERENCE ...], --reference REFERENCE [REFERENCE ...]\n                        reference file path(s), each line is a sentence\n  -s SYSTEM, --system SYSTEM\n                        system file path, each line is a sentence\n  --version, -V         show program's version number and exit\n```\nBlonDe-related arguments:\n```\n  --categories CATEGORIES [CATEGORIES ...], -c CATEGORIES [CATEGORIES ...]\n                        The categories of BLONDE. \n                        Default: ('tense', 'pronoun', 'entity', 'dm', 'n-gram')\n  --average-method {geometric,arithmetic}, -aver {geometric,arithmetic}\n                        The average method to use, geometric or arithmetic.\n                        Defaults: geometric\n  --smooth-method {none,floor,add-k,exp}, -sm {none,floor,add-k,exp}\n                        Smoothing method: exponential decay, floor (increment zero counts), add-k (increment num/denom by k for n>1), or none.\n                        Default: exp\n  --smooth-value SMOOTH_VALUE, -sv SMOOTH_VALUE\n                        The smoothing value.

Just when she was about to put down her cell phone, a barrage of posts bombarded her WeChat account.\nShe logged into her account and saw that a large number of fans in the Shen Liangchuan fan group had tagged her.\n[Qiao Lian: What happened?]\n[Chuan Forever: Qiao Lian, look at the headlines on Weibo, quickly!]\nShe froze momentarily, then picked up her cell phone and logged into Weibo. When she saw the headlines, her entire body immediately froze over again!\nShen Liangchuan arrived at the scene after accepting the invitation. The director immediately went to greet him in a respectful manner, politely welcoming him and expressing his gratitude for Shen Liangchuan‚Äôs presence today.\nShen Liangchuan did not speak. Instead he looked at Wang Wenhao, who was nearby.\nAfter Wang Wenhao‚Äôs scandal broke, every film he starred in had been taken down. Only this show could still be broadcasted, as Wang Wenhao had a supporting role in it and was practically unnoticeable.\nIn fact, the cast and crew hadn‚Äôt even invited Wang Wenhao. However, he had obtained a copy of the invitation letter somehow, and strode imposingly into the venue anyway.\nAfter all, this was his final chance.\nAfter his scandals broke, practically every advertiser and filming crew wanted to break their contracts with him.\nHe would rather take a supporting role than fade out into obscurity.\nThat was because the scandals surrounding him would never disappear.\nThus, Wang Wenhao went around trying to curry favor with everybody at this press conference.\nShen Liangchuan was wearing a dark grey suit and he had a cold expression. He was holding a champagne glass and was currently standing beside a table. He looked exceptionally stylish, but also exceptionally icy. As a result, none of the people around him dared to approach him.\nIf anyone had paid attention to him, they would have noticed that his gaze kept drifting over to Wang Wenhao.\nSong Cheng stood at his side. After noticing his behavior, he could not help but pinch his arm.\nShen Liangchuan turned around and looked at him casually, with a questioning face.\n‚ÄúBrother Shen, what are you planning to do? Can you tell me beforehand so that I can prepare myself mentally. You suddenly decide to come and attend such a small-scale press conference, yet you have been completely silent and are now just standing here and doing nothing? My heart is beating anxiously right now.‚Äù\nAfter Shen Liangchuan heard him speak, he sipped a mouthful of champagne and put the glass down.\nThen, he walked away in long strides.\nSong Cheng was extremely nervous and followed him. Shen Liangchuan walked forward, one step at a time, until he reached the front of the room.\nWang Wenhao was currently ingratiating himself with a C-list celebrity. The celebrity asked, ‚ÄúHey, I heard that you beat a paparazzi?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYeah, the paparazzi nowadays are so disgusting. I have wanted to teach them a lesson myself for some time now!‚Äù \"Are not you afraid of becoming an enemy of them?\"\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve already done it, so what should I be scared of? That time Best Actor Shen beat up a reporter, he claimed that it was in self-defence so that he would have an excuse if he got sued, right? At that time, nobody said anything‚Äù \nAs Wang Wenhao spoke, he laughed heartily. Just as he was about to continue speaking, he suddenly felt a presence approaching him from behind.\nHe turned around and saw Shen Liangchuan. His eyes narrowed and attempted to smile at him. However, Shen Liangchuan took a step forward, grabbed his tie and threw a punch at his face!\n```\n\n``ner_re.txt``:\n```\nPERSON: (Qiao Lian: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: (WeChat: 1; )\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Qiao Lian: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Qiao Lian: 1; )\tNONPERSON: (Weibo: 1; )\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: (Weibo: 1; )\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan‚Äôs: 1; )\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: (Wang Wenhao‚Äôs: 1; )\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Song Cheng: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Song Cheng: 1; Shen Liangchuan: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: ()\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Wang Wenhao: 1; )\tNONPERSON: ()\nPERSON: (Shen Liangchuan: 2; )\tNONPERSON: ()\n```\n\n``an.txt``:\n```\nJoe clenched his fist and bowed his head.\t4,Joe <pos/1,3>\t3,her, his <pos/35,37>\nIn fact, he's right.\t2\t5\nI am a fool, even will believe the love on the Internet.\t2\t5\nShe ticked her lips, took a deep breath, and was about to put her phone down, but weChat was blown open.\t6\t1,bombarded, blown open <pos/94,103>\nShe nodded in and found it was a cold powder group, and everyone was on her.\t1,logged, nodded <pos/5,10>\t4,cold powder group <pos/34,50>\nJoe: What's the matter?\t4,Joe <pos/1,3>\nChuan-flowing: Joe love, quickly look at the micro-blogging headlines!
