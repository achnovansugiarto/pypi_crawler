    "description": "# Library for finding best route in the routing table\n\nImplementation of trie-tree best route finding algorithm.\n\nIt is actually a bindings wrapper for the Rust library.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [.pyi stub file](https://github.com/KRunchPL/best-route-finder/blob/master/py-best-route-finder/best_route_finder/best_route_finder.pyi) (also included in the package) for detailed information.\n\nThe information from the stub file should be visible in your IDE hints as well as shown by \"Go to Definition\" IDE action.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\nfrom ipaddress import IPv4Address\n\nfrom best_route_finder import IPv4RoutingTableTree\n\ntable = IPv4RoutingTableTree()\ntable.insert(int(IPv4Address('192.168.1.0')), 24, 'ens192')\ntable.insert_by_string('10.0.0.0/8', 'ens10')\n\nassert 'ens192' == table.search_by_string('192.168.1.123')\nassert 'ens10' == table.search(int(IPv4Address('10.1.1.43')))\n```\n\n### Creating form the list\n\nThe `IPv4RoutingTableTree` also provides an option to create a routing table by passing a list of entries.\n\n```python\nclass IPv4RoutingTableTree:\n    (...)\n    def from_mapping(entries: list[__RoutingTableEntry]) -> 'IPv4RoutingTableTree': ...\n```\n\nThe entries have to implement interface compatible with:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass __RoutingTableEntry:\n    \"\"\"\n    Interface for a class representing single routing table entry\n\n    User shall provide own implementation of this interface\n    \"\"\"\n    subnet: IPv4Network  #: a subnet part of an entry\n    interface: str  #: next-hop interface name associated with the subnet\n```\n\nIn low-level terms they have to be objects that will have proper attributes set, so the following code will not raise an error:\n\n```python\nassert isinstance(entry.subnet.network_address._ip, int)\nassert isinstance(entry.subnet.prefixlen, int)\nassert isinstance(entry.interface, str)\n```\n\n",
