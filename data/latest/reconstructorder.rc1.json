    "description": "# ReconstructOrder\nReconstruct birefringence, slow axis, bright-field, and degree of polarization from polarization-resolved images. The core algorithm employs Stokes representation for reconstruction and background correction. The repository also provides utilities for batch analysis of multi-dimensional datasets acquired with Micro-Manager (https://micro-manager.org/) and OpenPolScope acquisition plugin (https://openpolscope.org/).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Create a new conda environment (optional, but recommended)\n>Install conda package management system by installing anaconda or miniconda (https://conda.io/). \n>Creating a conda environment dedicated to ReconstructOrder will avoid version conflicts among packages required by ReconstructOrder and packages required by other python software.\n>\n>```buildoutcfg\n>conda create -n <your-environment-name> python=3.7\n>conda activate <your-environment-name>\n>```\n\n#### All code blocks below assume you are in the above environment\n\n### Option 1: install released version via pip\n>ReconstructOrder is available on pip.  Running pip install will also install dependencies.\n>From your environment created above, type:\n>```buildoutcfg\n>pip install ReconstructOrder\n>```\n\n### Option 2: install developer version via git\n>Install the git version control system git : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n>\n>Use git to clone this repository to your current directory:\n>```buildoutcfg\n>git clone https://github.com/czbiohub/ReconstructOrder.git\n>```\n\n> * #### install dependencies\n>  You have two options to install dependencies: via pip (python index package) or via docker\n>\n>>  * ##### install dependencies via pip\n>>    If you are running ReconstructOrder on your own machine, navigate to the cloned repository \n>>  and install python library dependencies:\n>>\n>>    ```buildoutcfg\n>>    pip install -r requirements.txt\n>>    ```\n\n>>  * ##### install dependencies via docker\n>>\n>>    If you are running ReconstructOrder on a compute node (e.g., fry2@czbiohub), it is recommended to run it in \na Docker container. \nDocker is the virtual environment with all the required libraries pre-installed so you can run your copy of \nReconstructOrder without recreating the environment.\nThe docker image for ReconstructOrder has been built on fry2@czbiohub. \nIf you are running ReconstructOrder on other servers, you can build the docker image after cloning the repository \nby doing :    \n\n>>    ```buildoutcfg\n>>    docker build -t reconstruct_order:py37 -f Dockerfile.ReconstructOrder .\n>>    ```\n\n>>    Now, to start a docker container, do \n>>    ```buildoutcfg\n>>    docker run -it  -v /data/<your data dir>/:<data dir name inside docker>/ -v ~/ReconstructOrder:/ReconstructOrder reconstruct_order:py37 bash\n>>    ```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n>To run reconstruction, you will need to create a configuration file.  The configuration file is a .yml file and specifies parameters for:\n> * 'dataset'\n> * 'processing'\n> * 'plotting'\n>\n> Examples can be found https://github.com/czbiohub/ReconstructOrder under \"examples/example_configs\" folder\n> \n> See /ReconstructOrder/config/config_example.yml for an example config file with detailed explanation of parameters. \n>\n> Before running, you should modify the dataset:data_dir and dataset:processed_dir paths to point to source data path and output path, respectively.  Example data is located at examples/example_data \n>\n> #### There are two ways to run reconstruction:\n>>* #### from command line\n>>   If you pip installed the library, from any folder, simply type:\n>>   ```buildoutcfg\n>>   runReconstruction --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml\n>>   ```\n>>\n>>   If you cloned the developer repo, navigate to the repo and call the script:\n>>   ```buildoutcfg\n>>   (C:\\ReconstructOrder\\) python runReconstruction.py --config path-and-name-to-your-config.yml\n>>   ```\n>\n>>* #### from IPython\n>>   If you are writing your own code and want to use the ReconstructOrder library, you can reconstruct as follows:\n>>   ```buildoutcfg\n>>   import ReconstructOrder.workflow as wf\n>>   wf.reconstructBatch('path-and-name-to-your-config.yml')\n>>   ```\n\n\n## License\nChan Zuckerberg Biohub Software License\n\nThis software license is the 2-clause BSD license plus clause a third clause\nthat prohibits redistribution and use for commercial purposes without further\npermission.\n\nCopyright Â© 2019.
