    "description": "## Whitespace correction using Transformers\n\nCorrect missing or spurious whitespaces in text.\n\n### Installation\n\nThis project is mainly tested with Python 3.10, but should work fine with Python 3.8 and newer versions\n\n#### From PyPI\n\n```bash\npip install whitespace-correction\n```\n\n#### From source\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:ad-freiburg/whitespace-correction.git\ncd whitespace-correction\npip install .\n\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n#### From python\n\n```python\nfrom whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector\n\n# list all available models\nprint(WhitespaceCorrector.available_models())\n\n# create a whitespace corrector instance, using the default pretrained model\ncor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_pretrained()\n# you can move the whitespace correction model to a different device, e.g.\ncor.to(\"cuda\")  # default\ncor.to(\"cuda:3\")  # if you have multiple GPUs (alternatively use cor.to(3))\ncor.to(\"cpu\")\n# you can also set the inference precision (default is the \n# precision used for training), e.g.\ncor.set_precision(\"fp32\")\ncor.set_precision(\"fp16\")\ncor.set_precision(\"bfp16\")\n\n# correct single strings\ncorrected_string = cor.correct_text(\"p l e se,repiar thissen ten se!\")\n\n# correct multiple strings at once\nrepaired_strings = cor.correct_text([\n    \"p l e se,repiar thissen ten se!\",\n    \"alsosplitthissentenceforme\"\n])\n\n# correct text file (every line is treated as a separate sequence to correct),\n# returns an iterator over corrected lines\ncorrected_lines = cor.correct_file(\"path/to/file.txt\")\n# optionally specify an output file,\n# returns None\ncorrected_lines = cor.correct_file(\"path/to/file.txt\", output_file=\"save/output/here.txt\")\n```\n\n#### From command line\n\nAfter installation the command `wsc` (short for **w**hite**s**pace **c**orrection) is available in your python environment. \nIt lets you use the whitespace correction models directly from the command line.\nBelow are examples of how to use `wsc`. See `wsc -h` for all options.\n\n```bash\n# print version\nwsc -v\n\n# list available models\nwsc -l\n\n# by default wsc tries to read stdin, corrects the input it got line by line \n# and prints the corrected lines back out\n# therefore, you can for example use whitespace correction with pipes\necho \"splitthissentenceforme\" | wsc\ncat \"path/to/input/file.txt\" | wsc > output.txt\n\n# correct a string using\nwsc -c \"splitthissentenceforme\"\n\n# correct a text file line by line and print the corrected lines\nwsc -f path/to/input/file.txt\n# optionally specify an output file path where the corrected lines are saved\nwsc -f path/to/input/file.txt -o output.txt\n\n# start an interactive whitespace correction session\n# where your input will be corrected and printed back out\nwsc -i\n\n# start a whitespace correction server with the following endpoints:\n### /models [GET] --> output: available models as json \n### /info [GET] --> output: info about backend as json\n### /evaluate [POST] input: input, output, and groundtruth text --> output: evaluation metrics as json\n### /correct [POST] input: some text to correct --> output: corrected text and runtime information as json\nwsc --server <config_file>\n\n### OPTIONS\n### Pass the following flags to the wsc command to customize its behaviour\n-m <model_name> # use a different whitespace correction model than the default one \n--cpu # force execution on CPU, by default a GPU is used if available\n--progress # display a progress bar (always on when a file is repaired using -f)\n-b <batch_size> # specify a different batch size\n-batch-max-tokens <batch_max_tokens> # limit batch by a number of tokens and not by number of samples\n-u # do not sort the inputs before correcting\n--precision # set inference precision (one of fp32, fp16 and bfp16)\n-e <experiment_dir> # specify the path to an experiment directory to load the model from \n                    # (equivalent to WhitespaceCorrector.from_experiment(experiment_dir) in python API)\n--force-download # force download of the whitespace correction model even if it was already downloaded\n--progress # show a progress bar while correcting\n--report # print a report on the runtime of the model after finishing the correction\n```\n\n> Note: When first using `wsc` with a pretrained model, the model needs to be downloaded, so depending on\n> your internet speed the command might take considerably longer.\n\n> Note: Loading the whitespace correction model requires an initial startup time each time you\n> invoke the `wsc` command. CPU startup time is around 1s, GPU startup time around 3.5s, so for small\n> inputs or files you should probably pass the `--cpu` flag to force CPU execution for best performance.\n\n> See [configs/server.yaml](configs/server.yaml) for an exemplary server configuration file.\n\n### Documentation\n\n#### Use pretrained model\n\nIf you just want to use this project to correct whitespaces, this is the recommended way.\n\n```python\nfrom whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector\n\ncor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_pretrained(\n    # pretrained model to load, get all available models from available_models(),\n    # if None, loads the default model\n    model=None,\n    # the device to run the model on\n    # (\"cuda\" by default)\n    device=\"cuda\",\n    # optional path to a cache directory where downloaded models will be extracted to,\n    # if None, we check the env variable WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_CACHE_DIR, if it is not set \n    # we use a default cache directory at <install_path>/api/.cache \n    # (None by default)\n    cache_dir=None,\n    # optional path to a download directory where pretrained models will be downloaded to,\n    # if None, we check the env variable WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_DOWNLOAD_DIR, if it is not set \n    # we use a default download directory at <install_path>/api/.download\n    # (None by default)\n    download_dir=None,\n    # force download of model even if it already exists in download dir\n    # (False by default)\n    force_download=False\n)\n```\n\nWhen used for the first time with the command line interface or Python API the pretrained model will be automatically downloaded. \nHowever, you can also download our pretrained models first as zip files, put them in a directory on your local drive \nand set `WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_DOWNLOAD_DIR` (or the `download_dir` parameter above) to this directory.\n\nDownload links:\n- [eo_large_char_v1](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_large_char_v1.zip)\n- [eo_large_char](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_large_char_v2.zip)\n- [eo_large_byte](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_large_byte_v2.zip)\n- [eo_medium_char_v1](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_medium_char_v1.zip)\n- [eo_medium_char](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_medium_char_v2.zip)\n- [eo_medium_byte](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_medium_byte_v2.zip)\n- [eo_huge_byte](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/eo_huge_byte_v2.zip)\n- [ed_large_char](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/ed_large_v1.zip)\n- [ed_medium_char](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ACL_whitespace_correction_transformer_BHW_2023.materials/ed_medium_v1.zip)\n\n#### Use own model\n\nOnce you trained your own model you can use it in the following way.\n\n```python\nfrom whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector\n\ncor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_experiment(\n    # path to the experiment directory that is created by your training run\n    experiment_dir=\"path/to/experiment_dir\",\n    # the device to run the model on\n    # (\"cuda\" by default)\n    device=\"cuda\"\n)\n```\n\n### Directory structure\n\nThe most important directories you might want to look at are:\n\n```\nconfigs -> (example yaml config files for training and server)\nsrc -> (library code used by this project)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\nYou can also run this project using docker. Build the image using\n\n`docker build -t whitespace-correction .`\n\nIf you have an older GPU build the image using\n\n`docker build -t whitespace-correction -f Dockerfile.old .`\n\nBy default, the entrypoint is set to the `wsc` command, \nso you can use the Docker setup like described [here](#from-command-line) earlier.\n\nYou can mount /wsc/cache and /wsc/download to volumes on your machine, such that\nyou do not need to download the models every time.\n\n```bash\n# correct text\ndocker run whitespace-correction -c \"correctthisplease\"\n\n# correct file\ndocker run whitespace-correction -f path/to/file.txt\n\n# start a server\ndocker run whitespace-correction --server path/to/config.yaml\n\n# with volumes\ndocker run -v $(pwd)/.cache:/wsc/cache -v $(pwd)/.download:/wsc/download \\\n  whitespace-correction -c \"correctthisplease\"\n\n# optional parameters recommended when using a GPU:\n# --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864\n\nNote\n----\nMake sure you have docker version >= 19.03, a nvidia driver\nand the nvidia container toolkit installed (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)\nif you want to run the container with GPU support.\n```\n",
