    "description": "What is adapya?\r\n---------------\r\nWith adapya you can access Adabas databases from Python programs using\r\nthe Adabas API.\r\n        \r\nIt comes with sample programs to show its use and demonstrates new\r\nAdabas features like reading and storing of large binary objects using\r\nthe extended Adabas API (ACBX).      \r\n        \r\nAdabas is a commercial database system that runs on Windows,\r\nUnix and mainframe systems. For more information see\r\n   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adabas and\r\n   http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/adabas/default.asp\r\n        \r\nIn the download area you may also find an Adabas community version for\r\nWindows. \r\n        \r\nHere is the Adabas product documentation\r\n    http://documentation.softwareag.com/adabas/\r\n      \r\nPython is a scripting language that allows rapid prototyping,\r\nobject-oriented or functional style programming. It is open \r\nsource and is used in a large number of projects.\r\n        \r\n  Note: adapya does not implement a SQL interface as defined with the\r\n        Python DBAPI. You may do Adabas DBAPI access with the product \r\n        ADABAS SQL Gateway via the ODBC interface.\r\n        \r\n        adapya requires a good knowledge of the Adabas API.\r\n        \r\nadapya is a pure Python package: it does not require compilation of\r\nextensions. It should work on all platforms where CPython and Adabas are available.\r\nIt has been tested on Windows, Solaris and z/Linux.\r\nIt can access local Adabas databases and with the product NET-WORK     \r\nremote Adabas databases on all platforms including mainframe \r\nz/OS, VSE, BS2000).\r\n        \r\nPrerequisite for adapya is Python version 2.5, or Python version 2.3 and           \r\n2.4 where it requires the extra ctypes package.\r\n        \r\nadapya can be downloaded from\r\n           http://tech.forums.softwareag.com/viewforum.php?f=171&C=11\r\n\r\nadapya license\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");           \r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.          \r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at                                   \r\n                                                                          \r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0                            \r\n                                                                          \r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software       \r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,         \r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.  \r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and       \r\nlimitations under the License.",
