    "description": "=======================\nFormalSystems |travis|_\n=======================\n\n.. _travis : https://travis-ci.org/alexprengere/FormalSystems\n.. |travis| image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/alexprengere/FormalSystems.png\n\nThis is a Python implementation of *Douglas Hofstadter* formal systems, from his book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* (commonly *GEB*).\n\nIn fact, you may define your *own formal systems* using a quite simple syntax, close to free text.\nExamples for *MIU*, *pg*, *fg* and *NDP* formal systems from the book are implemented in directory *definitions*.\n\nA main Python script gives you possibilities to play with the formal system, including:\n\n- axiom schema support (iteration, decision procedure)\n- theorem step by step generation (using different algorithms)\n- theorem derivation\n\n\n------------------------\nFormal system definition\n------------------------\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThe *MIU* system may be define with:\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    axioms:\n        - MI\n\n    rules:\n        - x is .*, xI => xIU\n        - x is .*, Mx => Mxx\n        - x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy\n        - x y  .* , xUUy => xy\n\nThe underlying syntax is YAML (see raw format). You can define one or several axioms, or even an infinite number of axioms using a schema, as in the *pg* formal system:\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    axioms:\n        - x is -+, xp-gx-\n\n    rules:\n        - x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-\n\n\nSyntax\n======\n\nAxiom definitions should be formatted like this (``[]`` means this is optional):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n [def_1, [def_2, ...]] expr\n\nWhere:\n\n- ``def_i`` is an optional definition of *wildcard*, using a regular expression, for example:\n\n  - \".*\" may be anything including the empty string\n  - \"-+\" is a string composed of \"-\"\n\nThe definitions are written using ``char [is] regexp`` or ``char1 char2 [are] regexp`` if different wildcards have the same definition. Note that you should use only *one character* for wildcard definition.\n\n- ``expr`` is the axiom expression\n\nRules for theorem production should be formatted like this:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n [def_1, [def_2, ...]] cond_1 [and cond_2 [and ...]] => th_1 [and th_2 [and ...]]\n\nWhere:\n\n- ``def_i`` is the same as before\n- ``cond_i`` is a required theorem, in order to produce new theorems (separated by *and* if several conditions)\n- ``th_i`` is a produced theorems with the rule\n\n------------\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ python setup.py install --user\n\nA script should be put in ``~/.local/bin``, make sure this path is in your ``$PATH``:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n\n-----\nTests\n-----\n\nIf installation is successful, run the tests with:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ cd tests\n $ python test_formalsystems.py -v\n\n-----------\nMain script\n-----------\n\nAfter installation, you should have the main script ``FormalSystemsMain.py`` deployed somewhere where you ``$PATH`` points to, under the name ``FormalSystems``.\nIf it is not the case, you can always execute the script directly, assuming the dependencies are properly installed (just *pyyaml* and *LEPL*).\n\nUsage of the main script is fully documented in ``--help`` argument.\n\nYou may generate theorems step by step if the number of axioms is finite:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ FormalSystems definitions/MIU.yaml --iteration 3 \n > Finite number of axioms, using step algorithm\n\n STEP 1: MI\n\n P  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MI                         gives  MIU\n P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MI                         gives  MII\n .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MI                       \n .  (4) x y  .* , xUUy => xy                  for  MI                       \n\n STEP 2: MIU/MII\n\n P  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MII                        gives  MIIU\n .  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MIU                      \n P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MII                        gives  MIIII\n P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MIU                        gives  MIUIU\n .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MII                      \n .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MIU                      \n .

(4) x y  .* , xUUy => xy                  for  MIU                      \n\n STEP 3: MIIU/MIIII/MIUIU\n\nOr using a bucket where axioms are thrown and theorems computed iteratively if the number of axioms is infinite:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ FormalSystems definitions/pg.yaml --iteration 4\n > Infinite number of axioms, using bucket algorithm\n\n [Adding -p-g-- to bucket]\n\n === BUCKET 1:
