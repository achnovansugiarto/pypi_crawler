    "description": "Module to import CODA bank statements.\n======================================\n\nSupported are CODA flat files in V2 format from Belgian bank accounts.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    * CODA v1 support.\n    * CODA v2.2 support.\n    * Foreign Currency support.\n    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).\n    * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format \n      Communications.\n    * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.\n    * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.\n    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single \n      CODA file.\n    * Support for 'parsing only' CODA Bank Accounts (defined as type='info' in \n      the CODA Bank Account configuration records).\n    * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN, \n      NL, FR.\n\nThe machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in \nCODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of \nthe CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the \ncreation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a \n'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original\nCODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting \nbusiness processes.\n\nCODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.\n\nA removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the \nassociated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank \nStatements will also remove those associated statements.\n\nThe following reconciliation logic has been implemented in the CODA processing:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    1) The Company's Bank Account Number of the CODA statement is compared against \n       the Bank Account Number field of the Company's CODA Bank Account \n       configuration records (whereby bank accounts defined in type='info' \n       configuration records are ignored). If this is the case an 'internal transfer'\n       transaction is generated using the 'Internal Transfer Account' field of the \n       CODA File Import wizard.\n    2) As a second step the 'Structured Communication' field of the CODA transaction\n       line is matched against the reference field of in- and outgoing invoices \n       (supported : Belgian Structured Communication Type).\n    3) When the previous step doesn't find a match, the transaction counterparty is \n       located via the Bank Account Number configured on the OpenERP Customer and \n       Supplier records.\n    4) In case the previous steps are not successful, the transaction is generated \n       by using the 'Default Account for Unrecognized Movement' field of the CODA \n       File Import wizard in order to allow further manual processing.\n\nIn stead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also \nre-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that \nwas missing to allow automatic reconciliation.\n\nRemark on CODA V1 support:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured \ncommunication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The\ndescription provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA \nV2.2 specifications.\nIf required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.",
