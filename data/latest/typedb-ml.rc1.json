The structure of the GNNs are totally customisable, with network components for popular topics such as graph attention and graph transformers built-in.  \n\n## Features\n\n### NetworkX\n- Declare the graph structure of your queries, with optional sampling functions.\n- Query a TypeDB instance and combine many results across many queries into a single graph (`build_graph_from_queries`).\n### PyTorch Geometric\n- A `DataSet` object to lazily load graphs from a TypeDB instance. Each graph is converted to a PyG `Data` object.\n- It's most natural to work with PyG `HeteroData` objects since all data in TypeDB has a type. Conversion from `Data` to `HeteroData`is available in PyG, but it loses node ordering information. To remedy this, TypeDB-ML provides `store_concepts_by_type` to store concepts consistent with a `HeteroData` object. This enables concepts to be properly re-associated with predictions after learning is finished.\n- A `FeatureEncoder` to orchestrate encoders to generate features for graphs.\n- Encoders for Continuous and Categorical values to apply encodings/embedding spaces to the types and attribute values present in TypeDB data.\n- A [full example for link prediction](examples/diagnosis)\n### Other\n- Example usage of Tensorboard for PyG `HeteroData`\n\n## Resources\nYou may find the following resources useful, particularly to understand why TypeDB-ML started: \n- [Strongly Typed Data for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhUyurWMiSQ) (YouTube, 2021)\n- [How Can We Complete a Knowledge Graph?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDi1_UaFtU) (YouTube, 2018)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Install\n\n- Python >= 3.7.x\n\n- Grab the `requirements.txt` file from [here](requirements.txt) and install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This is due to some intricacies installing PyG's dependencies, see [here](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/issues/861) for details.\n\n- Installed TypeDB-ML: `pip install typedb-ml`. \n\n- [TypeDB 2.11.1](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb/releases) running in the background.\n\n- `typedb-client-python` 2.11.x ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/typedb-client/), [GitHub release](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-client-python/releases)). This should be installed automatically when you `pip install typedb-ml`.\n\n### Run the Example\n\nTake a look at the [PyTorch Geometric heterogeneous link prediction example](examples/diagnosis) to see how to use TypeDB-ML to build a GNN on TypeDB data.\n\n## Development\n\nTo follow the development conversation, please join the [Vaticle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vaticle), and join the `#typedb-ml` channel. Alternatively, start a new topic on the [Vaticle Discussion Forum](https://forum.vaticle.com).\n\nTypeDB-ML requires that you have migrated your data into a [TypeDB](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb) or TypeDB \nCluster instance. There is an [official examples repo](https://github.com/vaticle/examples) for how to go about this, and information available on [migration in the docs](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/examples/phone-calls-migration-python). Alternatively, there are fantastic community-led projects growing in the [TypeDB OSI](https://typedb.org) to facilitate fast and easy data loading, for example [TypeDB Loader](https://github.com/typedb-osi/typedb-loader).\n\n\n### Building from Source\n\nIt's expected that you will use Pip to install, but should you need to make your own changes to the library, and import it into your project, you can build from source as follows:\n\nClone TypeDB-ML:\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:vaticle/typedb-ml.git\n```\n\nGo into the project directory:\n\n```\ncd typedb-ml\n```\n\nBuild all targets:\n\n```\nbazel build //...\n```\n\nRun all tests. Requires Python 3.7+ on your `PATH`. Test dependencies are for Linux since that is the CI environment: \n\n```\nbazel test //typedb_ml/... --test_output=streamed --spawn_strategy=standalone --action_env=PATH\n```\n\nBuild the pip distribution. Outputs to `bazel-bin`:\n\n```\nbazel build //:assemble-pip\n```\n\n\n",
