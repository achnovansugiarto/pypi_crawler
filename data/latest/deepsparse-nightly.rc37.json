Read [more about sparsification](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/user-guides/sparsification).\n\nNeural Magic's DeepSparse is able to integrate into popular deep learning libraries (e.g., Hugging Face, Ultralytics) allowing you to leverage DeepSparse for loading and deploying sparse models with ONNX. \nONNX gives the flexibility to serve your model in a framework-agnostic environment. \nSupport includes [PyTorch,](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) [TensorFlow,](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) [Keras,](https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx) and [many other frameworks](https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall DeepSparse Community as follows: \n\n```bash\npip install deepsparse\n```\n\nDeepSparse is available in two editions: \n1. [**DeepSparse Community**](#installation) is open-source and free for evaluation, research, and non-production use with our [DeepSparse Community License](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/engine-license-agreement/).\n2. [**DeepSparse Enterprise**](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/products/deepsparse-ent) requires a Trial License or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications.\n\n## 🧰 Hardware Support and System Requirements\n\nTo ensure that your CPU is compatible with DeepSparse, it is recommended to review the [Supported Hardware for DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/user-guide/deepsparse-engine/hardware-support) documentation.\n\nTo ensure that you get the best performance from DeepSparse, it has been thoroughly tested on Python versions 3.7-3.10, ONNX versions 1.5.0-1.12.0, ONNX opset version 11 or higher, and manylinux compliant systems. It is highly recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) when running DeepSparse. Please note that DeepSparse is only supported natively on Linux. For those using Mac or Windows, running Linux in a Docker or virtual machine is necessary to use DeepSparse.\n\n## Features\n\n- 👩‍💻 Pipelines for [NLP](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/transformers), [CV Classification](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/image_classification), [CV Detection](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/yolo), [CV Segmentation](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/yolact) and more!\n- 🔌 [DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server)\n- 📜 [DeepSparse Benchmark](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark)\n- ☁️ [Cloud Deployments and Demos](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples)\n\n### 👩‍💻 Pipelines\n\nPipelines are a high-level Python interface for running inference with DeepSparse across select tasks in NLP and CV:\n\n|          NLP          |            CV             |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n|  Text Classification `\"text_classification\"`  | Image Classification `\"image_classification\"`      |\n|  Token Classification `\"token_classification\"` | Object Detection `\"yolo\"`          |\n|  Sentiment Analysis `\"sentiment_analysis\"`   | Instance Segmentation `\"yolact\"`       |\n|  Question Answering `\"question_answering\"`   | Keypoint Detection `\"open_pif_paf\"`       |\n| MultiLabel Text Classification `\"text_classification\"` |                  |\n| Document Classification `\"text_classification\"` |                         |\n| Zero-Shot Text Classification `\"zero_shot_text_classification\"` |                         |\n\n\n**NLP Example** | Question Answering\n```python\nfrom deepsparse import Pipeline\n\nqa_pipeline = Pipeline.create(\n    task=\"question-answering\",\n    model_path=\"zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\",\n)\n\ninference = qa_pipeline(question=\"What's my name?\", context=\"My name is Snorlax\")\n```\n**CV Example** | Image Classification\n\n```python\nfrom deepsparse import Pipeline\n\ncv_pipeline = Pipeline.create(\n  task='image_classification', \n  model_path='zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned95-none',\n)\n\ninput_image = \"my_image.png\"\ninference = cv_pipeline(images=input_image)\n```\n\n\n### 🔌 DeepSparse Server\n\nDeepSparse Server is a tool that enables you to serve your models and pipelines directly from your terminal.\n\nThe server is built on top of two powerful libraries: the FastAPI web framework and the Uvicorn web server. This combination ensures that DeepSparse Server delivers excellent performance and reliability. Install with this command:\n\n```bash\npip install deepsparse[server]\n```\n\n#### Single Model\n\nOnce installed, the following example CLI command is available for running inference with a single BERT model:\n\n```bash\ndeepsparse.server \\\n    task question_answering \\\n    --model_path \"zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\"\n```\n\nTo look up arguments run: `deepsparse.server --help`.\n\n#### Multiple Models\nTo deploy multiple models in your setup, a `config.yaml` file should be created. In the example provided, two BERT models are configured for the question-answering task:\n\n```yaml\nnum_workers: 1\nendpoints:\n    - task: question_answering\n      route: /predict/question_answering/base\n      model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none\n      batch_size: 1\n    - task: question_answering\n      route: /predict/question_answering/pruned_quant\n      model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni\n      batch_size: 1\n```\n\nAfter the `config.yaml` file has been created, the server can be started by passing the file path as an argument:\n```bash\ndeepsparse.server config config.yaml\n```\n\nRead the [DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server) README for further details.\n\n### 📜 DeepSparse Benchmark\n\nDeepSparse Benchmark, a command-line (CLI) tool, is used to evaluate the DeepSparse Engine's performance with ONNX models. This tool processes arguments, downloads and compiles the network into the engine, creates input tensors, and runs the model based on the selected scenario. \n\nRun `deepsparse.benchmark -h` to look up arguments:\n\n```shell\ndeepsparse.benchmark [-h] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-i INPUT_SHAPES] [-ncores NUM_CORES] [-s {async,sync,elastic}] [-t TIME]\n                     [-w WARMUP_TIME] [-nstreams NUM_STREAMS] [-pin {none,core,numa}] [-e ENGINE] [-q] [-x EXPORT_PATH]\n                     model_path\n\n```\n\n\nRefer to the [Benchmark](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark) README for examples of specific inference scenarios.\n\n### 🦉 Custom ONNX Model Support\n\nDeepSparse is capable of accepting ONNX models from two sources:\n\n**SparseZoo ONNX**: This is an open-source repository of sparse models available for download. [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) offers inference-optimized models, which are trained using repeatable sparsification recipes and state-of-the-art techniques from [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).\n\n**Custom ONNX**: Users can provide their own ONNX models, whether dense or sparse. By plugging in a custom model, users can compare its performance with other solutions.\n\n```bash\n> wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx\nSaving to: ‘mobilenetv2-7.onnx’\n```\n\nCustom ONNX Benchmark example:\n```python\nfrom deepsparse import compile_model\nfrom deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs\nonnx_filepath = \"mobilenetv2-7.onnx\"\nbatch_size = 16\n\n# Generate random sample input\ninputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)\n\n# Compile and run\nengine = compile_model(onnx_filepath, batch_size)\noutputs = engine.run(inputs)\n```\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) repository contains package APIs and examples that help users swiftly begin benchmarking and performing inference on sparse models.\n\n### Scheduling Single-Stream, Multi-Stream, and Elastic Inference\n\nDeepSparse offers different inference scenarios based on your use case. Read more details here: [Inference Types](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/source/scheduler.md).\n\n⚡ **Single-stream** scheduling: the latency/synchronous scenario, requests execute serially. [`default`]\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/single-stream.png\" alt=\"single stream diagram\" />\n\nIt's highly optimized for minimum per-request latency, using all of the system's resources provided to it on every request it gets.\n\n⚡ **Multi-stream** scheduling: the throughput/asynchronous scenario, requests execute in parallel.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/multi-stream.png\" alt=\"multi stream diagram\" />\n\nThe most common use cases for the multi-stream scheduler are where parallelism is low with respect to core count, and where requests need to be made asynchronously without time to batch them.\n\n## Resources\n#### Libraries\n- [DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/)\n- [SparseML](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparseml/)\n- [SparseZoo](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsezoo/)\n- [Sparsify](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsify/)\n\n#### Versions\n- [DeepSparse](https://pypi.org/project/deepsparse) | stable\n- [DeepSparse-Nightly](https://pypi.org/project/deepsparse-nightly/) | nightly (dev)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/releases) | releases\n\n#### Info\n- [Blog](https://www.neuralmagic.com/blog/) \n- [Resources](https://www.neuralmagic.com/resources/)\n\n## Community\n\n### Be Part of the Future...
