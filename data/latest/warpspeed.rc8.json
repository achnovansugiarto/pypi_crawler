It augments transformer models with tools for accessing external APIs, such as searches, calculators, spreadsheets, docs, email, and many others. Our initial focus is on supporting large language models (LLMs) but we plan to expand framework's capabilities to cover text-to-anything functionality soon.\n\nWith Warpspeed, you can accomplish the following:\n\n1. 🚰 Build sequential **AI pipelines** and sprawling **DAG workflows** for complex use cases.\n2. 🧰️ Augment LLMs with **chain of thought** capabilities and **external tools**, such as calculators, web search, spreadsheet editors, and API connectors.\n3. 💾 Add **memory** to AI pipelines for context preservation and summarization.\n\nPlease note that Warpspeed is in early development. Its APIs and documentation are subject to change. For now, this README file is the most accurate source of documentation and examples.\n\n## Getting Started\nFirst, install Warpspeed with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install warpspeed\n```\n\nSecond, configure an OpenAI client by [getting an API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and adding it to your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Warpspeed uses [OpenAI Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) to execute LLM prompts and to work with [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) data structures.\n\nWith Warpspeed, you can create *structures*, such as `Pipelines` and `Workflows`, that are composed of different types of steps. You can also define structures as JSON objects and load them into Warpspeed dynamically. Let's start with defining a simple pipeline.\n\n## 🚰 AI Pipelines and Workflows\n\nPipelines are lists of steps that are executed sequentially. Pipelines can have `Memory`, which makes them ideal for storing LLM conversations.\n\n```python\nfrom warpspeed import utils\nfrom warpspeed.memory import PipelineMemory\nfrom warpspeed.steps import PromptStep\nfrom warpspeed.structures import Pipeline\n\npipeline = Pipeline(\n    memory=PipelineMemory()\n)\n\npipeline.add_steps(\n    PromptStep(\"{{ args[0] }}\"),\n    PromptStep(\"Say the following like a pirate: {{ input }}\")\n)\n\npipeline.run(\"I am Scotty, who are you?\")\npipeline.run(\"Who am I?\")\n\nprint(utils.Conversation(pipeline.memory).to_string())\n```\n\nBoom! Our first conversation, à la ChatGPT, is here:\n\n> Q: I am Scotty, who are you?  \n> A: Arrr, I be an AI language model designed to assist and answer yer questions, matey!  \n> Q: Who am I?  \n> A: Yarrr, ye just introduced yerself as Scotty, so ye be Scotty, matey!\n\nYou can dynamically pass arguments to the prompt by using Jinja templates:\n\n```python\nPromptStep(\"tell me about {{ topic }}\", context={\"topic\": \"the hobbit novel\"})\n```\n\nIn addition to user-defined fields, the `context` object contains the following:\n\n### As Part of `Pipeline`\n- `args`: arguments passed to the `Construct.run()` method.\n- `input`: input from the parent.\n- `structure`: the structure that the step belongs to.\n- `parent`: parent step.\n- `child`: child step.\n\n### As Part of `Workflow`\n- `args`: arguments passed to the `Construct.run()` method.\n- `inputs`: inputs into the current step referencable by parent step IDs.\n- `structure`: the structure that the step belongs to.\n- `parents`: parent steps referencable by IDs.\n- `children`: child steps referencable by IDs.\n\nWarpspeed uses OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model by default. If you want to use a different model, set a custom OpenAI prompt driver:\n\n```python\nPipeline(\n    prompt_driver=OpenAiPromptDriver(temperature=0.1, model=\"gpt-4\")\n)\n```\n\nNow, let's build a simple workflow. Let's say, we want to write a story in a fantasy world with some unique characters. We could setup a workflow that generates a world based on some keywords. Then we pass the world description to any number of child steps that create characters. Finally, the last step pulls in information from all parent steps and writes up a short story.\n\n```python\ndef character_step(step_id, character_name) -> PromptStep:\n    return PromptStep(\n        \"Based on the following world description create a character named {{ name }}:\\n{{ inputs['world'] }}\",\n        context={\n            \"name\": character_name\n        },\n        id=step_id\n    )\n\nworld_step = PromptStep(\n    \"Create a fictional world based on the following key words {{ keywords|join(', ') }}\",\n    context={\n        \"keywords\": [\"fantasy\", \"ocean\", \"tidal lock\"]\n    },\n    id=\"world\"\n)\n\ncharacter_step_1 = character_step(\"scotty\", \"Scotty\")\ncharacter_step_2 = character_step(\"annie\", \"Annie\")\n\nstory_step = PromptStep(\n    \"Based on the following description of the world and characters, write a short story:\\n{{ inputs['world'] }}\\n{{ inputs['scotty'] }}\\n{{ inputs['annie'] }}\",\n    id=\"story\"\n)\n\nworkflow = Workflow()\n\nworkflow.add_step(world_step)\n\nworld_step.add_child(character_step_1)\nworld_step.add_child(character_step_2)\nworld_step.add_child(story_step)\n\ncharacter_step_1.add_child(story_step)\ncharacter_step_2.add_child(story_step)\n\nworkflow.run()\n\n[print(step.output.value) for step in workflow.output_steps()]\n```\n\nAnd here is the beginning of our story:\n\n> Scotty and Annie had been friends since childhood, and their bond had only grown stronger over the years. Scotty had always been fascinated by the ocean and its secrets, and Annie had always been drawn to its magical creatures. [...]\n\nWorkflows and pipelines can also be defined in JSON files and loaded dynamically in Python:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt_driver\": {\n    \"temperature\": 0.5,\n    \"type\": \"OpenAiPromptDriver\"\n  },\n  \"steps\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"world\",\n      \"type\": \"PromptStep\",\n      \"parent_ids\": [],\n      \"child_ids\": [\n        \"scotty\",\n        \"annie\"\n      ],\n      \"prompt_template\": \"Create a fictional world based on the following key words {{ keywords|join(', ') }}\",\n      \"context\": {\n        \"keywords\": [\n          \"fantasy\",\n          \"ocean\",\n          \"tidal lock\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere is how you can load and run it:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"workflow.json\", \"r\") as file:\n    workflow = Workflow.from_json(file.read())\n\n    workflow.run()\n```\n\n## 🧰️ Tools\n\nThe most powerful feature of Warpspeed is the ability of workflow and pipeline prompt steps to generate *chains of thought* and use tools that can interact with the outside world. We use the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) technique to implement reasoning and acting in the underlying LLMs without using any fine-tuning. There are two types of tool steps that Warpspeed supports:\n\n- `ToolStep` takes one tool as a parameter and passes it to the LLM that decides if it should use it to respond to the prompt.\n- `ToolkitStep` takes multiple tools as a parameter, so that the underlying LLM can decide which tool to use for every chain of thought step.\n\nHere is how to use tools:\n\n```python\npipeline = Pipeline()\n\npipeline.add_steps(\n    ToolStep(\n        \"Research and summarize the most important events of February 2023\",\n        tool=WikiTool()\n    ),\n    ToolkitStep(\n        \"Calculate 3^12 and send an email with the answer and the following text to hello@warpspeed.cc:\\n{{ input }}\",\n        tools=[\n            CalculatorTool(),\n            EmailSenderTool(\n                host=\"localhost\",\n                port=1025,\n                from_email=\"hello@warpspeed.cc\",\n                use_ssl=False\n            )\n        ],\n        id=\"calc_email\"\n    )\n)\n\npipeline.run()\n```\n\n`ToolStep` instructs an LLM to use a `WikiTool` that provides a JSON schema and *few-shot learning* examples that the LLM is automatically \"trained\" on to interact with Warpspeed. The LLM can then decide to use a tool to provide a better prompt response by adding substeps that follow the Thought/Action/Observation ReAct routine. For this prompt, it can obviously use a Wiki tool to obtain new information.\n\n`ToolkitStep` works the same way, but it provides multiple tools for the LLM to choose from depending on the task. In our example, the LLM uses `CalculatorTool` to calculate `3^12` and `EmailSenderTool` to send an email.\n\nWarpspeed supports multiple tools and allows you to implement your own.\n\n### `AwsTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to run AWS CLI commands. Before using this tool, make sure to [install and configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) AWS CLI v2.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"show me all of my VPCs\",\n    tool=AwsTool()\n)\n```\n\n> **Warning**\n> By default, this tool uses `CommandRunner`, which executes commands locally in a subprocess. This is not ideal for production environments, where you generally want to execute arbitrary commands in a container. We are working on adding more command runner options soon.\n\n### `CalculatorTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to make simple calculations. Here's how to use it:\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"what's 123^321?\",\n    tool=CalculatorTool()\n)\n```\n\nThe LLM will be prompted to reason via the Thought/Action/Observation loop to use the calculator and respond with an answer that the calculator provided.\n\n> **Warning**\n> By default, this tool uses `PythonRunner`, which executes code locally with sanitized `exec`. This is not ideal for production environments, where you generally want to execute arbitrary code in a container. We are working on adding more code runner options soon.\n\n### `SqlClientTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to execute SQL statements via [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Depending on your underlying SQL engine, [configure](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) your `engine_url` and give the LLM a hint about what engine you are using via `engine_hint`, so that it can create engine-specific statements.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"list the last 20 items in the orders table\",\n    tool=SqlClientTool(\n        engine_url=\"sqlite:///warpspeed.db\",\n        engine_hint=\"sqlite\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### `DataScientistTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to run more complex calculations in Python. The user can notify the LLM which libraries are available by specifying them in the constructor. By default, only `math` is available.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"what's 123^321?\",\n    tool=DataScientistTool(\n        libs={\"numpy\": \"np\", \"math\": \"math\"}\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis will make `numpy` available as `np` via `import numpy as np` and `math` as `math` via `import math`. Before injecting libraries in the constructor, make sure they are installed in your current environment.\n\n> **Warning**\n> By default, this tool uses `PythonRunner`, which executes code locally with sanitized `exec`. This is not ideal for production environments, where you generally want to execute arbitrary code in a container. We are working on adding more code runner options soon.\n\n### `GoogleSearchTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to search Google. Every search returns links, titles, and short descriptions. Search has two modes: scraping (default) and API-based. To enable [API-based search](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com) set `use_api`, `api_search_key`, and `api_search_id` params.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"Find the latest on LLMs\",\n    tool=GoogleSearchTool()\n)\n```\n\n### `GoogleSheetsWriterTool` and `GoogleSheetsReaderTool`\n\nThese tools enable LLMs to read from and write to Google Sheets worksheets. Before using those tools, make sure to download the service account credentials JSON file and share your spreadsheet with the service account. For more information refer to the `gspread` [auth docs](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html).\n\nTo read from a spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"read all spreadsheet values from the 2nd and 3rd columns\",\n    tool=GoogleSheetsReaderTool(\n        auth_key_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/Desktop/service_account.json\"),\n        spreadsheet_key=\"<Google Sheets spreadsheet ID>\",\n        worksheet_name=\"<optional worksheet name, defaults to the first worksheet>\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\nTo write to a spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"Create a spreadsheet with columns for 2022 months in the MM/YYYY format, last column for totals, and rows for profit, revenue, and loss\",\n    tool=GoogleSheetsWriterTool(\n        auth_key_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/Desktop/service_account.json\"),\n        spreadsheet_key=\"<Google Sheets spreadsheet ID>\",\n        worksheet_name=\"<optional worksheet name, defaults to the first worksheet>\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### `EmailSenderTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to send emails.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"send an email with a haiku to hello@warpspeed.cc\",\n    EmailSenderTool(\n        host=\"localhost\",\n        port=1025,\n        from_email=\"hello@warpspeed.cc\",\n        use_ssl=False\n    )\n)\n```\n\nFor debugging purposes, you can run a local SMTP server that the LLM will send emails to:\n\n```shell\npython -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025\n```\n\nUser the `WARPSPEED_EMAIL_SENDER_TOOL_PASSWORD` environment variable to set the password.\n\n### `WebScraperTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to scrape web pages for full text, summaries, authors, titles, and keywords. It can also execute search queries to answer specific questions about the page.\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"Can you tell me what's on this page? https://github.com/usewarpspeed/warpspeed\",\n    tool=WebScraperTool()\n)\n```\n\n### `WikiTool`\n\nThis tool enables LLMs to search and query Wikipedia articles:\n\n```python\nToolStep(\n    \"Research and summarize biggest world news stories in February of 2023\",\n    tool=WikiTool()\n)\n```\n\n### Building Your Own Tool\n\nBuilding your own tools is easy with Warpspeed! All you need is a Python class, JSON schema to describe tool actions to the LLM, a set of examples, and a Marshmallow schema for serialization/deserialization. Let's walk through all the required steps and build a simple random number generator tool.\n\nFirst, create a Python class in a separate directory that generates a random float and optionally truncates it:\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom warpspeed.tools import Tool\n\n\nclass RandomGenTool(Tool):\n    def run(self, num_of_decimals: Optional[int]) -> float:\n        if num_of_decimals is None:\n            return random.random()\n        else:\n            return round(random.random(), num_of_decimals)\n\n```\n\nAdd a `schema.json` file describing the tool:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n  \"title\": \"random_gen\",\n  \"description\": \"This tool can be used to generate random numbers\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"tool\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"enum\": [\"random_gen\"]\n    },\n    \"input\": {\n      \"type\": \"int\",\n      \"description\": \"The number of decimals to be considered while rounding. Default to null.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"tool\", \"input\"]\n}\n```\n\nFinally, add an `examples.j2` Jinja file with a couple of few-shot learning examples:\n\n```\nInput: generate a random number\nThought: I need to use the random_gen tool to answer this question.\nAction: {\"tool\": \"random_gen\", \"input\": null}\nObservation: 0.8444218515250481\nThought: I have enough information to answer the question\nOutput: 0.8444218515250481\n\nInput: generate a random number and round it to 2 decimal places\nThought: I need to use the random_gen tool to answer this question.\nAction: {\"tool\": \"random_gen\", \"input\": 2}\nObservation: 0.14\nThought: I have enough information to answer the question\nOutput: 0.14\n```\n\nFinally, if you want to use `to_json` and `from_json` serialization/deserialization methods, you'll have to add a [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) schema to your tool:\n\n```python\nfrom marshmallow import post_load\nfrom warpspeed.schemas import BaseSchema\n\n\nclass RandomGenToolSchema(BaseSchema):\n    @post_load\n    def make_obj(self, data, **kwargs):\n        from .random_gen.random_gen_tool import RandomGenTool\n\n        return RandomGenTool(**data)\n\n```\n\nThe schema class has to be in the following format: `<ToolClassName>Schema` and be located in `<tool_class_name>_schema.py`.\n\nBefore using the tool, make sure to create an `__init__.py` file in the tool directory with the following contents:\n\n```python\nfrom .random_gen_tool import RandomGenTool\nfrom .random_gen_tool_schema import RandomGenToolSchema\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"RandomGenTool\",\n    \"RandomGenToolSchema\"\n]\n\n```\n\nFinally, to use the tool:\n\n```python\nfrom warpspeed.steps import ToolStep\nfrom random_gen.random_gen_tool import RandomGenTool\n\n\nToolStep(\n    \"generate a random number and round it to 3 decimal places\",\n    tool=RandomGenTool()\n)\n```\n\nIf you are deserializing a workflow or a pipeline from JSON, make sure to specify deserialization schema namespace:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"schema_namespace\": \"random_gen.random_gen_tool_schema\",\n  \"type\": \"RandomGenTool\"\n}\n```\n\nCheck out other [Warpspeed tools](https://github.com/usewarpspeed/warpspeed/tree/main/warpspeed/tools) to learn more about tools' implementation details. \n\n## 💾 Memory\n\nWarpspeed supports different types of memory for pipelines. Due to the non-linear nature of workflows you can't use memory with them yet, but we are currently investigating other possibilities.\n\nBy default, pipelines don't initialize memory, so you have to explicitly pass it to them:\n\n```python\nPipeline(\n    memory=PipelineMemory()\n)\n```\n\nThere are two other types of memory: `BufferPipelineMemory` and `SummaryPipelineMemory`. `BufferPipelineMemory` will keep a sliding window of steps that are used to construct a prompt:\n\n```python\nPipeline(\n    memory=BufferPipelineMemory(buffer_size=3)\n)\n```\n\nThis works great for shorter pipelines but fails if the whole workflow context needs to be present. You can use `SummaryMemory` to address that:\n\n```python\nPipeline(\n    memory=SummaryPipelineMemory(\n        summarizer=CompletionDriverSummarizer(\n            driver=OpenAiPromptDriver()\n        ),\n        offset=2\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis will progressively summarize the whole pipeline except for the last two steps.\n\nFinally, you can persist memory by using memory drivers. Warpspeed comes with one memory driver for automatically storing memory in a file on the disk. Here is how you can initialize memory with a driver:\n\n```python\nPipelineMemory(\n    driver=DiskMemoryDriver(file_path=\"memory.json\")\n)\n```\n\nTo load memory:\n\n```python\nDiskMemoryDriver(file_path=\"memory.json\").load()\n```\n\nYou can easily build drivers for your own data stores by extending `MemoryDriver`. You only need to implement `store` and `load` methods.\n\n## Running Tests\nBefore running tests:\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/usewarpspeed/warpspeed`\n2. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n3. `pip install warpspeed`\n4. `cd warpspeed`\n\nTo run unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/`\n\nTo run the tests with *coverage*: `pytest --cov --cov-report html tests/unit/`\n\nTo see the coverage report go to warpspeed/htmlcov/index.html\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions in the form of bug reports, feature ideas, or pull requests are super welcome! Take a look at the current issues and if you'd like to help please submit a pull request with some tests.\n\n## License\n\nWarpspeed is available under the Apache 2.0 License.\n",
