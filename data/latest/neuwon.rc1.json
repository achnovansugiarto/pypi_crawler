This software is a modern remake of\n        the NEURON simulator. It is accurate, efficient, and easy to use.\n        \n        ## Model Architecture\n        \n        Models are composed of three types of components: physical structures,\n        reactions, and diffusions.\n        \n        #### Physical Structures\n        \n        Neurons are composed of discrete segments which are connected into a tree\n        structure. The shape of each segment is a frustum, also known as a truncated\n        cone. The physical locations of the tips of the frustums in the system serve as\n        tracking points for all cellular processes: intracellular, extracellular, and\n        membrane-related. The extracellular space is partitioned into voronoi cells\n        which are centered on the tracking points. NEUWON provides the following\n        geometric properties for each tracking point:\n        \n        * Cell Segment Properties\n            + Length\n            + Diameter\n            + Cross-sectional Area\n            + Membrane Surface Area\n            + Intracellular Volume\n            + Tree Structure\n                - Parent Segment, unless segment is root of tree\n                - Child Segments, list\n        * Extracellular Space Properties\n            + Volume\n            + Adjacent Tracking Points\n                - Distance between points\n                - Surface Area of border\n        \n        #### Reactions\n        \n        Chemical reactions are one of the mechanisms which the brain uses to implement\n        differential equations. Complex reactions are capable of performing arbitrary\n        calculations and large proteins can maintain a persistent state. Proteins\n        embedded in the cell membrane can react to the electrical potential across the\n        membrane, and can control the flow of chemicals across the membrane.\n        \n        #### Diffusions and Electrotonics\n        \n        Diffusion is the primary means of communication between locations in the brain.\n        Chemicals diffuse through the intracellular and extracellular fluids and across\n        cell membranes. Diffusion is modeled with a linear & time-invariant systems of\n        differential equations, and so it can be simulated using specialized method\n        which are both exact and efficient (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999). Electrically\n        charged ions flow throughout neurons; a phenomenon which is modeled with an\n        equivalent electrical circuit. The equivalent circuit is a linear &\n        time-invariant system of differential equations, and so it is also simulated\n        using the specialized methods.\n        \n        ### Integration Methods\n        \n        Reactions and diffusions interact at staggered time steps, as explained in\n        chapter 4 of the NEURON book.\n        [Mention that mechanisms & reactions are reported at the unstable timepoint.]\n        \n        [Talk about exact integration in more detail]\n        \n        ## Usage\n        \n        #### Installation\n        \n        Prerequisites:\n        * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)\n        * numpy & scipy\n        \n        TODO: Install & Test instructions\n        \n        #### Model Specification\n        \n        TODO Document how to use the model builder class.\n        \nPlatform: UNKNOWN\nClassifier: License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\nClassifier: Development Status :: 1 - Planning\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 3\nClassifier: Operating System :: OS Independent\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Science/Research\nClassifier: Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence\nRequires-Python: >=3.6\nDescription-Content-Type: text/markdown\n",
