    "description": "Jupyter Notebooks Controller Daemon\n===================================\n\nDaemon, which ensures, that the Jupyter notebooks server is started only once, no metter how often or where from you open a notebook.\nNo root privileges required.\n\nBesides of Jupyter, the package requires Python 2, Pyro and the ``argparse`` module.\nIt was successfully tested with version 3.14 of Pyro and is known not to work with Pyro 4.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04, the dependencies are satisfied by issuing the following command:\n::\n\n    sudo apt-get install pyro\n\n\nInstallation\n++++++++++++\n\nFetch the latest version:\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/kostrykin/jupyter-ctrl.git\n\n\nInstall as a user:\n::\n\n    cd jupyter-ctrl\n    python2 setup.py install --user\n\n\nEnsure that ``~/.local/bin`` is listed in your ``$PATH`` variable:\n::\n\n    echo 'export PATH=\"$PATH:~/.local/bin\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nUsage\n+++++\n\nAdd the following command to the list of commands to be run on start-up by your desktop manager:\n::\n\n    jupyter-daemon.py\n\nOn most Ubuntu-based systems, this is accomplished through the ``gnome-session-properties`` application.\n\nRun the following command to open-up a notebook (e.g. ``Unnamed.ipynb`` in your working directory) in your favorite web browser:\n::\n\n    xdg-open `jupyter-view.py Unnamed.ipynb`\n\nIt's convenient to set this to be the default \"application\" for opening up ``.ipynb`` files.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the ``jupyter-open`` bash script for convenience, which does the same:\n::\n\n    jupyter-open Unnamed.ipynb\n\nNote that file managers, which support ``.desktop`` files, should offer ``Jupyter Notebook`` as a method of opening files after installing this package.\nIt was tested with Pantheon files 0.2.4.\n\nStatus Bar Indicator\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAlongside of ``jupyter-daemon.py``, you may also want to put ``jupyter-indicator.py`` on your list of automatically started desktop applications, which is a highly rudimentary user interface for the daemon:\n\n.. image:: http://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostrykin/jupyter-ctrl/master//doc/jupyter-indicator.png?raw=true\n\nUse the ``--icon`` parameter to adjust the appearance e.g. for bright or dark themes.\nThe two icons ``jupyter-bright`` and ``jupyter-dark`` are installed by default, but you may also use any icon you like.",
