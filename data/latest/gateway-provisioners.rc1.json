However, unlike \\[process proxies\\]\n(https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors/system-architecture.html#process-proxy),\nyou do not need to use a gateway server to use these provisioners - although, in certain cases,\nit is recommended (for example when the launching server does not reside within the same network as the launched kernel).\n\nHere is the current set of provisioners provided by this package, many of which have their requirements conditionally\ninstalled:\n\n- `KubernetesProvisioner` - Kernels (residing in images) are launched as pods within a Kubernetes cluster\n  - `pip install gateway_provisioners[k8s]`\n- `DockerSwarmProvisioner` - Kernels (residing in images) are launched as containers within a DockerSwarm cluster\n- `DockerProvisioner` - Kernels (residing in images) are launched as containers\n  - `pip install gateway_provisioners[docker]`\n- `YarnProvisioner` - Kernels are launched into a Hadoop YARN cluster (primarily Spark)\n  - `pip install gateway_provisioners[yarn]`\n- `DistributedProvisioner` - Kernels are launched across a set of hosts using SSH, round-robin\n  - `pip install gateway_provisioners`\n\nThis package also includes command-line utilities that can be used to create kernel specifications or inject bootstrap\nfiles into docker images relative to the desired provisioner:\n\n- `jupyter-k8s-spec` - for building kernel specifications relative to the `KubernetesProvisioner`\n- `jupyter-docker-spec` - for building kernel specifications relative to `DockerProvisioner` and `DockerSwarmProvisioner`\n- `jupyter-yarn-spec` - for building kernel specifications relative to the `YarnProvisioner`\n- `jupyter-ssh-spec` - for building kernel specifications relative to the `DistributedProvisioner`\n- `jupyter-image-bootstrap` - for injecting bootstrap support when building kernel-based images\n\n**NOTE: The container-based provisioners (`KubernetesProvisioner`, `DockerSwarmProvisioner`, and `DockerProvisioner`)\nrequire that the hosting server also be running within the same environment/network. As a result, these\nprovisioners may be better suited for use by a Gateway Server (Kernel Gateway or Enterprise Gateway) so\nas to not require the Notebook/Lab server to be in a container.**\n\n## Installation\n\nDetailed installation instructions are located in the\n[Operators Guide](https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/installing-gp.html)\nof the project docs. Here's a quick start using `pip`:\n\n```bash\n# install from pypi\npip install --upgrade gateway-provisioners\n\n# options for the command-line utilities can be viewed using '--help-all'\njupyter k8s-spec install --help-all\n\n# run it with default options\njupyter k8s-spec install\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe [Contribution page](https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors/contrib.html) includes\ninformation about how to contribute to Gateway Provisioners. We encourage you to explore the other topics in our \\[Contributor's Guide\\]\n(https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors/index.html)\nlike how to [set up a development environment](https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors/devinstall.html),\ngaining an understanding of the [system architecture](https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors/system-architecture.html),\nand taking a look at the \\[API documentation\\[(https://gateway-provisioners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/modules.html), among other thigns.\n",

This includes all of the Jupyter Subprojects, which are the different repositories under the [jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/) GitHub organization.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our copyright policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  ``` # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License. ```",
