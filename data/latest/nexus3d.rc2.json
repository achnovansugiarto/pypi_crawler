    "description": "![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/nexus3d)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nexus3d)](https://pypi.org/project/nexus3d/)\n[![Pytest](https://github.com/domna/nexus3d/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/domna/nexus3d/actions/workflows/pytest.yml)\n\n# Scope\n\nThis is a project for reading out NX_TRANSFORMATION matrices from nexus files and\nvisualizing them by creating a 3D representation file (e.g. stl or gltf) which may be imported into 3D visualization software.\n\n# Install\n\nThe easiest way to install is with pip\n\n```\npip install nexus3d\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/domna/nexus3d.git\n```\n\nfor the latest development install.\n\nIf you want to keep to source code or use a development install clone the repostitory\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/domna/nexus3d.git\ncd nexus3d\n```\n\nand install with\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\nfrom the cloned git repository or add an optional `-e` to install it in development mode.\n\n# Usage\n\nExecute\n\n```\nnexus3d nexus_file.nxs\n```\n\non your nexus file to generate an output file `experiment.glb`.\nThe usage of the command is as follows:\n\n```\nUsage: nexus3d [OPTIONS] FILE\n\n  Create a glb/gltf or stl from a nexus file via the command line. The actual\n  file format is chosen from the file ending of the output file (default:\n  experiment.glb).\n\nOptions:\n  -o, --output TEXT     The filename to write to (default: experiment.glb).\n  -c, --config TEXT     Config file to load stl drawings into the final output\n  -s, --size FLOAT      The side length of a cube in meters. (default: 0.1 m).\n  -f, --force           Force overwriting of output file.\n  --include-process     Include transformations inside /entry/process\n  --store-intermediate  Store the intermediate matrices in gltf child nodes.\n                        Only applicable for gltf or glb files.\n  --help                Show this message and exit.\n```\n\nThe optional config file in json format can be used to load stl files for the different objects, it should be according to the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instrument/my_fancy_instrument\": {\n    \"file\": \"my_fancy_instrument.stl\",\n    \"x\": 5,\n    \"y\": 10,\n    \"z\": 3\n  },\n  \"sample\": {\n    \"file\": \"sample_holder.stl\",\n    \"z\": 3,\n    \"rot_x\": 90,\n    \"unit\": \"mm\"\n  },\n  \"instrument/detector\": {\n    \"file\": \"my_detector.stl\",\n    \"unit\": \"inch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe json keys have to be named after their respective group containing a NXtransformation without leading `/entry/`.\nThe `file` attribute points to the stl file to be loaded.\nAdditionally, three keys (`x`, `y`, `z`) for translation (in meters) and three keys (`rot_x`, `rot_y`, `rot_z`) for rotation (in degrees) may be provided to introduce an additional shift and rotation of the stl drawing relative to\nthe coordinate frame from the nexus file. This is to account for any drawing offsets relative to the point denoted in the\nnexus transformations. The shifts are introduced in the coordinate frame of the entry.\nThe rotations are applied first and then the object is translated.\nRotation are applied first `x`, second `y` and last `z`.\nThe full chain is therefore\n$$T  R_z  R_y  R_x  v$$\n, applied to the vector `v` in the coordinate frame of the entry.\nTo account for different units in the stl files a unit field may be provided.\nThe unit needs to be [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io) convertible to meter.\nIf the unit field is not given meter is taken as default unit.\n\n# Display in the web\n\nAn example for [three.js](https://threejs.org) based rendering is available in `examples/threejs`. It is based on this [example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=gltf#webgl_loader_gltf) from three.js. The example can be directly viewed in the github pages of this project: [https://domna.github.io/nexus3d/](https://domna.github.io/nexus3d/). To quickly view your model there exists the excellent [gltf viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com), which also allows to adjust lighting and materials of your model.\n",
