The goal was to\nlight the LEDs based on the current speed vs the fastest lap of the session.\nHence the name \"Exit Speed\".  Carrying a higher speed on the exit of a turn is\ncrucial in the pursuit of faster lap times.\n\nThis mimics the behavior of the red/blue triangle in the HUD of GT Sport.\nExit Speed will display green LEDs if the car is faster and red when the car is\nslower based on the car's position compared to the fastest lap of the session.\n\nLater a DAQ device was added for measuring and logging voltage from sensors such\nas the throttle position and water temperature.  In turn the data was exported\nto a Timescale database which allows for real time analysis of the data in\nGrafana.  Including lap comparison.\n\n[![4K Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/07UoDFVGBuI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/07UoDFVGBuI)\n\n[![Image of Green LEDs](https://github.com/djhedges/exit_speed/blob/master/docs/green_led.png)](https://youtu.be/sWjJ_7Hw02U)\n\nExample of data logged at Portland International Raceway being replayed.\n[![Replayed Data](http://img.youtube.com/vi/bjZeXXChDv4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bjZeXXChDv4)\n\nWater temperature data logged while on track and tethered to a phone.\n![Water Temp](https://github.com/djhedges/exit_speed/blob/master/docs/water_temp.png)\n\nLap comparison examples.  Total hack atm but a work in progress.\n![Speed](https://github.com/djhedges/exit_speed/blob/master/docs/lap_comparison_speed.png)\n![TPS](https://github.com/djhedges/exit_speed/blob/master/docs/lap_comparison_tps_voltage.png)\n\n## Hardware\n\n### Adafruit DotStar LEDs\n\nThe Adafruit DotStar LEDs can be trimmed to a desired length and provide ample\nbrightness for use in a race car.\nhttps://www.adafruit.com/product/2241\n\n### ADXL345\n\nA ADXL345 accelerometer is used to measure the g forces experienced by the car.\nCalibration was done following the Sparkfun guide to set the min/max values.\nI need to take the extra time to read the specsheets to see if there is a more\naccurate way to calibrate the ADXL345.  I read somewhere about a sine instead\nof linear.\nhttps://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/adxl345-hookup-guide#calibration\n\n### UBlox 8\n\nThe USB GPS dongle used is GNSS100L.  It is based on the UBlox 8 chipset which\nis very well documented.  Note you'll want to bump the output rate of the device\nto 10hz based on the UBX-CFG-RATE setting.  This can be done with the Ublox\nwindow software can be set to persist between power cycles.  There were a\ncouple of other settings that seem reasonable to change as well so I recommend\nreading the manual.  Unfortunately it's been several months since I initial\nsetup the device and I no longer recall what the other settings were.\nhttp://canadagps.com/GNSS100L.html\nhttps://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox8-M8_ReceiverDescrProtSpec_%28UBX-13003221%29.pdf\n`Bus 001 Device 007: ID 1546:01a8 U-Blox AG [u-blox 8]`\n\n### Labjack U3\n\nFor converting analog voltages to digtial a Labjack U3 device as chosen based on\nthe documentation, API, examples and awesome support.  There are cheaper DAQ\ndevices out there however the U3 also supports high voltage readings (0-10v on\nAIN-0-4 inputs).\nhttps://labjack.com/products/u3\n\nThey also sell voltage dividers to drop high voltages down to the acceptable low\nvoltage range of 0-2.4v or 0-3.6v for the FIO4-EIO7 inputs.\nhttps://labjack.com/accessories/ljtick-divider\n\nIt's worth noting the options for grounding the U3.  We ran a ground from the\nSGND inputs.\nhttps://labjack.com/support/datasheets/u3/hardware-description/ain/analog-input-connections/signal-powered-externally\n\n### WBO2\n\nThe car I have came with an older WBO 2A0/2A1 device with a LD01 display for the\nair fuel ratio.  Luckily the logging format of the devcie's terminal output is\nwell documented.  The wide band device also supports logging of 3 additional\n5v sensors and 3 thermocouple inputs.\nhttp://wbo2.com/2a0/default.htm\n\n## Software Design Choices\n\nPython has suprisingly been able to keep up with the GPS 10hz output.  Ideally\nthis should be rewritten in Go or C++.\n\nI've always wanted to play with the multriprocessing module and it has proved\nuseful.  For example the metrics which are uploaded to Timescale are done in a\nseperate process.  This isolates the main process from unexpected errors and\ndelays on I/O operations.  The Labjack and WBO2 readings also take place in\nseperate processes as well.\n\n### Crossing Start/Finish\n\nExit Speed has a map of tracks in the NW with GPS locations of arbitrary\nstart/finish points selected from Google maps.   The ExitSpeed class is\ninitialized with a start_finish_range which determines how close the car needs\nto be to the finish line before we consider the lap complete.  Without the range\nlimit points on far ends of the track would have counted as crossing\nstart/finish.\n\nOnce the car is within range triangles are created consisting of two points\nalong the straight away and the start/finish point from the prior mapping.\nWhen the older of the two points obtuse (greater than 90 degress) it is\ndetermined that the car has crossed start/finish.  The older point becomes the\nfirst and last point of a lap.\n\n### Lap Timing\n\nTo improve upon lap time calculation a bit of trigonometry and physics is used\nto calculate a laptime with a resolution of thousands of a seconds despite the\n10hz GPS refresh.  Accuracy during testing was within Â±0.022 seconds while on\naverage being off by only 0.008 seconds compared to the transponder timing from\na race.\n\nWe start by calcuating the distance between B & C and from B to start/finish\nand C to start/finish.  Knowing the 3 sides of the triangle we're able to\ndeterimine the angle of B.\n\nThe timing between points C & B is 0.1 seconds and we know the speed at\npoints B & C.  This allows us to calcuate the acceleration between points B & C.\nNext we can calcuate the distance from point B to when the car actually crosses the start finish line.\n\nFinally we take the time between the first and last points of a lap and subtract\nthe time it take for the car to travel from start/finish to point C.  Finally add the time it took on the prior lap for the car to travel from start/finish to\npoint C.\n\n```\npoint_c |\\\n        | \\\n        |  \\\n        |   \\\n        |____\\______ start/finish\n        |    /\n        |   /\n        |  /\n        |B/\npoint_b |/\n```\n\nComparison of transponder lap times vs Exit Speed lap times.\n\n|Transponder | Exit Speed | Deltas|\n|------------|------------|-------|\n|1:36.530\t   | 1:36.508\t  | 0.022 |\n|1:32.029\t   | 1:32.020\t  | 0.009 |\n|1:32.149\t   | 1:32.144\t  | 0.005 |\n|1:31.832\t   | 1:31.838\t  | 0.006 |\n|1:30.893\t   | 1:30.884\t  | 0.009 |\n|1:31.422\t   | 1:31.417\t  | 0.005 |\n|1:31.500\t   | 1:31.510\t  | 0.010 |\n|1:33.516\t   | 1:33.499\t  | 0.017 |\n|1:32.415\t   | 1:32.428\t  | 0.013 |\n|1:31.665\t   | 1:31.658\t  | 0.007 |\n|1:31.075\t   | 1:31.076\t  | 0.001 |\n|1:31.271\t   | 1:31.270\t  | 0.001 |\n|1:30.932\t   | 1:30.930\t  | 0.002 |\n|1:31.504\t   | 1:31.508\t  | 0.004 |\n\n### Speed Deltas (LEDs)\n\nFor the fastest lap a BallTree is constructed of GPS coordinates for the lap.\nOn the current lap each GPS point's speed is compared against the closest point of the best lap by searching the BallTree.  The delta of the speed of these\npoints are stored in a collections.deque which holds the last 10 points.  If the\nmedian of the points are faster then the LEDs are set to green.  If slower\nthey're set to red.\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html\n\nAnother way to put it is if the median speed of the last second is faster set\nthe LEDs to green.  Else red.\n\nEarlier versions experimented with updating the LEDs more often as well as\nhaving a ratio of LEDs lit based on the size of the speed delta.  But having\nLEDs flicker all the time can be distracting.  Also GPS inaccuracies can lead to\nmisleading results.  I find it's best to glance at the LEDs on the straights.\n\nHere is an example of the LEDs in action.\nhttps://youtu.be/sWjJ_7Hw02U\n\n### Grafana & Timescale\n\nInitially Prometheus and InfluxDB were tested before settling on Timescale.\nGrafana is designed for displaying time series data which is great for live or\nreplayed data.  However that made graph lap comparisons difficult.  Since\nTimescale is backed by PostgresSQL I was able to come up with some clever\nGrafana queries to overlay laps.  It sounds like Grafana plans to add support\nfor graphing none time series data in the future.\nhttps://youtu.be/2FHSHHTeZAU\nhttps://youtu.be/joWSMB6zanM\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n### GPS\n\nThis going off memory but I believe I downloaded the u-center software from Ublox.\nhttps://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center\n\nThen modified the following settings:\n\n*   UBX-CFG-RATE  # 10hz\n*   UBX-CFG-CFG   # Save the config so it persists after a power cycle.\n*   TODO: Document other settings that might be usefull.\n\nExternal documentation on setting the 10hz rate.\nhttps://gpswebshop.com/blogs/tech-support-by-vendors-stoton/how-to-change-the-gnss100l-or-gnss200l-usb-gps-update-rate-to-10hz/\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install gfortran libatlas3-base libblas-dev libgfortran5 liblapack-dev python3 pip3\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you run into issues I would take a look at the travis config for pointers.\nTravis used to build and run unittests from a clean environment on each change\nand weekly.\nhttps://github.com/djhedges/exit_speed/blob/master/.travis.yml\n\n### Labjack\n\nIf your setup is using a Labjack for measuring sensors you'll need to install\nthe Exodrivers.\nhttps://labjack.com/support/software/installers/exodriver\n\n## Examples & Usage\n\n### Config\n\nMy current config is checked in as corrado.yaml.  It provides mapping between\ninputs to point proto fields.  By removing `labjack:` or `wbo2:` from the config\nthe corresponding subprocesses are disabled.\n\n```\nleds: True\ntimescale: True\nlabjack:\n  ain0: fuel_level_voltage\n  ain1: water_temp_voltage\n  ain2: oil_pressure_voltage\nwbo2:\n  lambda_16: afr\n  rpm_count: rpm\n  user_3: tps_voltage\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n```\n./exit_speed.py --helpfull\n\n./exit_speed.py:\n  --data_log_path: The directory to save data and logs.\n    (default: '/home/pi/lap_logs')\n\nconfig_lib:\n  --config_path: The location of the Exit Speed config.\n    (default: './etc/corrado.yaml')\n\nleds:\n  --led_brightness: Percentage of how bright the LEDs are. IE 0.5 == 50%.\n    (default: '0.5')\n    (a number)\n  --led_update_interval: Limits how often the LEDs are able to change to prevent\n    excessive flickering.\n    (default: '0.2')\n    (a number)\n  --speed_deltas: Used to smooth out GPS data.  This controls how many recent\n    speed deltas are stored.  50 at 10hz means a median of the last 5 seconds is\n    used.\n    (default: '10')\n    (an integer)\n\ntimescale:\n  --commit_cycle: Number of points to commit at a time.\n    (default: '3')\n    (an integer)\n  --timescale_db_spec: Postgres URI connection string.\n    (default: 'postgres://exit_speed:faster@cloud:/exit_speed')\n\nwbo2:\n  --cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine.\n    (default: '6')\n    (an integer)\n  --stoichiometric: This is used to convert the Lambda_16 bytes into an A/F\n    ratio. This should be changed based on fuel.Petrol 14.7, LGP 15.5, Methanol\n    6.4, Diesel 14.5\n    (default: '14.7')\n    (a number)\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n#### exit_speed.py\n\nStarts Exit Speed and logs to stderr.\n\n```\n./exit_speed.py --log_dir ~/lap_logs/ --config_path=./etc/corrado.yaml \\\n  --alsologtostderr\n```\n\nQuick and dirty way to start Exit Speed on boot is by adding the following to\n`/etc/rc.local`.  You can than connect to the screen session with `screen -rd`.\n\n```\nsu - pi -c \"screen -S exit_speed -dm /home/pi/git/exit_speed/exit_speed.py \\\n  --log_dir ~/lap_logs/ --config_path=/home/pi/git/exit_speed/etc/corrado.yaml \\\n  --alsologtostderr\" &\n```\n\n#### replay_data.py\n\nExit Speed logs points to `--log_dir` in files ending in `.data` such as\n`2020-09-24T12:57:12.500000_1.data`.  The data files can be replayed which\ninto to Timescale.\n\n```\n./replay_data.py ~/lap_logs/2020-09-24T12\\:57\\:12.500000_1.data \\\n  --include_sleep=False\n```\n\nIf `--include_sleep=True` is set then delays are added to mimic as if the\nreplayed data was being recorded in real time.  `--include_sleep=True` also tags\nthe data as \"replayed\" instead of \"live\" and is removed by cleanup_timescale.py.\n\n#### cleanup_timescale.py\n\ncleanup_timescale.py is used to reduce the number of laps stored in Timescale.\n\n```\n./cleanup_timescale.py --max_lap_duration_ms=180000 --min_lap_duration_ms=60000\n```\n\n\n",
