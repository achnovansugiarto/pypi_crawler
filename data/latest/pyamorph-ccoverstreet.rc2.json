    "description": "AMORPH\n========\n\n(c) 2016–2018 [Brendon J. Brewer](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~brewer/)\nand [Michael Rowe](http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/people/michael-rowe)\n\nAMORPH is free software, released under the GNU General Public License,\nversion 3. See the LICENSE file for details.\n\n# Using the PyPI package\n\nThe associated python package is for the postprocessing of AMORPH results.\n\nTo install, run `python3 -m pip install pyamorph-ccoverstreet` or `python -m pip install pyamorph-ccoverstreet`\n\nTo use:\n```python3\n\nimport pyamorph\n\npyamorph.amorph_postprocess()\n\n```\n\n**or**\n\nIn your terminal, run `python3 -m pyamorph` to perform analysis on the files in your current directory\n\nGuide to installing and operating (building from source) **Ignore python information below**:\n==================================\n\n**IMPORTANT: New Build Process**\n\n- `git clone https://github.com/ccoverstreet/AMORPH --recursive`\n- `cd AMORPH/src`\n- `make`. This may take a minute or two.\n- ./AMORPH (make sure that all necessary config/data files are in the same directory)\n___\n\n\nAMORPH is hosted at the following URL:\n\n[https://bitbucket.org/eggplantbren/amorph]([https://bitbucket.org/eggplantbren/amorph)\n\nThe repository includess the source code, Python scripts for viewing results,\nexample datasets, and the Windows executable file (`AMORPH.exe`), which is\nthe easiest way of using AMORPH. It is located (along with almost everything\nelse) in the `src` subdirectory.\nThe Python scripts make use of the packages Numpy, matplotlib, Pandas, and\nyaml, and has only\nbeen tested under Python 3. [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](Anaconda) is a\nconvenient distribution of Python which comes with these packages\npre-installed.\n\nThe AMORPH program can be installed anywhere on the computer. All data files to\nbe analysed by AMORPH need to be in .txt file format, space delimited, with no\nheaders (i.e., just two columns of numbers). For simplicity, text files for\nprocessing should be located in the same folder as the AMORPH program.\nTo configure a run, edit the file `config.yaml` to specify all the details of\nthe data file and other things you might want to tweak.\n\nFour test datasets are stored in the repository\n(`0%glass_rhyolite_Emperyon.txt`, `50% glass.02step3secdwell.txt`,\n`90%_glass_basalt_Emperyon.txt`, and `easy_data.txt`).\nThe program is set to run until\n10,000 saved parameter sets have been generated. Outputs may be viewed at any\npoint, however, closing the program before reaching  10,000 will reduce the\naccuracy of the final calculations. After running for a while, the output can\nbe viewed by running the Python script `showresults.py`:\n\n```\npython showresults.py\n```\n\nAutomatically generated figures may be closed or saved. Upon closing the\nfigures, numerical results will be displayed in Anaconda prompt window,\nand a CSV file of (some) output will be written to the disk.\nImportant: make sure to save the results or copy the output file before\nstarting another run as results will otherwise be overwritten.\n\nRecommendations for Use\n=======================\n\nBased on experimentation, several recommendations for optimization of use and\naccuracy may be suggested to potential users. First, the time of the analysis\nis dependent on the number of data points to be analyzed. Thus to optimize\nanalysis time, we recommend an XRD instrument step of 0.02 degrees/step.\nWhile coarser steps will reduce analysis time, the peak broadening associated\nwith it may reduce precision of the fitting. We also recommend reducing the\ntotal scan range to between 10–40 degrees (2theta). This has two advantages;\n1) it will reduce the number of data points for processing and 2) outside this\nrange the X-ray diffraction pattern is dominated by only the crystalline\ncomponentry and thus incorporation of higher 2-theta values skews measured\nresults to higher measured crystallinities.\n\nBackground positions are currently optimized for the use of CuKa x-ray sources,\nwith linear fits between 10–40° 2theta as described in the manuscript. For\nother X-ray sources, it may be necessary to adjust these fixed points to\nprovide the best fit to the diffraction patterns. This may be modified by\nchanging the values in control_points.in (which can be opened in any text\neditor). For some analyses, typically when more data points are analysed\n(5–50 degrees 2theta) or for highly crystalline materials, the numerical\nsettings of the DNest4 sampler are not optimal for obtaining useful results,\nand need to be made more conservative (making the run slower).\nThis is typically manifested in Python outputs as pale colours in the model\ncurves in the output plots (showing hardly any samples from the posterior)\nand a low number of data points for subsequent histograms.\nThe settings can be modified in these instances by opening the OPTIONS file\nin any text editor. Parameter values on line 4 (new level interval) and line 8\n(Backtracking scale length) can each independently be doubled. Note, while this\nwill improve model outputs, it significantly lengthens the time of analysis.\nTherefore we only recommend changing one of these two parameters at a time.\n\n\nUsing the source code\n=====================\nIf you don't want to use `AMORPH.exe` and would rather compile AMORPH\nyourself, you'll need the dependencies yaml-cpp, boost, and DNest4.\n\n\n",
