    "description": "Google Analytics for Python and the command-line\n================================================\n\n|Build Status|\n\n``google-analytics`` takes the pain out of working with the Google\nAnalytics reporting APIs. It supports both the Core and the Real Time\nAPI. It is written in Python but there's also a full-featured\ncommand-line interface.\n\n-  **Authentication.** OAuth2 is a bit of a pain and we've made it\n   easier, both for interactive use and for `server\n   applications <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/blob/master/examples/server.py>`__.\n   We can also save your credentials in the operating system's keychain\n   if you want to.\n-  **Querying.** Easier to query per week, month or year. Query using\n   metric IDs or using their full names, whichever you think is nicer.\n   Work with both the Core and the Real Time APIs.\n-  **Reporting.** Generate reports from the command-line. Optionally\n   describe reports and queries in `easy-to-read and easy-to-write YAML\n   files <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/blob/master/examples/query.yml>`__.\n   Reports in Python work better too: iterate through the entire report\n   or column-per-column.\n-  **Exploration.** Traverse the account hierarchy from account to\n   webproperty to profile to dimensions, both programmatically and with\n   the included command-line interface.\n-  **Exports.** Clean JSON and CSV – as well as\n   `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ data frames – so you can\n   analyze the data in anything from Excel to R.\n\nThis package is built on top of `Google's own API client for\nPython <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation>`__.\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nFirst, install the package using\n`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__\n\n-  Python 2: ``pip install googleanalytics``\n-  Python 3: ``pip3 install googleanalytics``\n\nThen, create a new project in the `Google Developers\nConsole <https://console.developers.google.com>`__, enable the Analytics\nAPI under \"APIs & auth > APIs\" and generate credentials for an installed\napplication under \"APIs & auth > Credentials\". Keep this page open. For\nmore detail, look at the `wiki page on\nauthentication <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication>`__.\n\nAfter that, executing your first query is as easy as\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import googleanalytics as ga\n    accounts = ga.authenticate()\n    profile = accounts[0].webproperties[0].profile\n    pageviews = profile.core.query.metrics('pageviews').range('yesterday').value\n    print(pageviews)\n\nOr on the command-line, that'd be:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    googleanalytics --identity <identity> --account <account> --webproperty <webproperty> \\\n        query pageviews --start yesterday\n\nThe account, webproperty and profile determine what data you'll be\nquerying. Learn more about profiles and querying on the\n`Querying <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Querying>`__\nwiki page, or alternatively look at the `Common\nQueries <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Common-Queries>`__\npage for lots of examples. Read more about how to work with the\nresulting data in `Working With\nReports <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Working-With-Reports>`__.\n`On The\nCommand-Line <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/On-The-Command-Line>`__\nhas more details about the command-line application.\n\nThe example above will authorize the app and authenticate you\ninteractively. It is also possible to pass credentials as arguments in\nPython, using environment variables or from your operating system's\nkeychain. Authentication is treated in much more depth on the\n`authentication wiki\npage <https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication>`__.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics.svg\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics",
