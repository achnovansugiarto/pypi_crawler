However, this kind of\nsequences cause more locks and can turn a database slow.\n\nTaking as example an invoice, if you assign an invoice number to one record,\nbut it sill not finish the process, this process must end in order to another\ninvoice could assign a new number and there was no gaps between the invoice\nnumbers. It seems to be good at first sight. But the problem starts when there\nis a chained process.\n\nImagine that there is one user that executes a process that produces 100\ninvoices and these at the same time produces 100 journal entries that also use\na consecutive (no gap) sequence. And also those invoices are sent to sign with\nand external institution (that could take 2 seconds in giving a response\nbecause of internet latency or server load), and maybe they made another\ncalculations that makes them to take 5 seconds more for each invoice, and all\nthis is chained to one single transaction. This means that for 8.5 minutes\nanybody else could confirm invoices, neither journal entries of the involved\njournals.\n\nNow, think there is 20 users that have to execute a similar process. The\nproblem turns exponential. If another user comes to make an operation with the\nsame jornal it will thrown a concurrency failure.\n\nYou can mitigate it if you segment each transaction and don't chain them. It\nmeans, making commit for each invoice or process. It reduces the\nprobability that there is a concurrency error or a lock wait. However, it still\nnot solve it completely.\n\nWhy to use Sequences with \"Standard\" Implementation\n===================================================\n\nIf you use the standard sequence of PosgreSQL, it doesn't lock because at the\nmoment the request is done, the next sequence number it is changed in an\nisolated transaction, and it have not to wait the other transaction to end.\nHowever, if the transaction produces a rollback, this sequence isn't reverted,\nit means, it's lost. It may be not not serious because when you cancel or\nremove records that number is lost too.\n\nWhat this module does\n=====================\n\nTo eliminate completely that concurrency/slowness problem, this module changes\nall the sequences (ir.sequence) implementation from \"No Gap\" to \"Standard\" with\nthe awareness that it will skip numbers. In the majority of database models\nand many users projects there is no problem with that jump occurs.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues/new?body=module:%20ir_sequence_standard_default%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Vauxoo\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Moises LÃ³pez <moylop260@vauxoo.com>\n- Erick Birbe <erick@vauxoo.com>\n\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-moylop260| image:: https://github.com/moylop260.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/moylop260\n    :alt: moylop260\n.. |maintainer-ebirbe| image:: https://github.com/ebirbe.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/ebirbe\n    :alt: ebirbe\n\nCurrent `maintainers <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-moylop260| |maintainer-ebirbe| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/server-tools <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/tree/12.0/ir_sequence_standard_default>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
