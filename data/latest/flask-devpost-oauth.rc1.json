    "description": "*`Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...`*\n\n# The Unofficial Devpost OAuth Library\nDevpost doesn't have an authentication system (I wonder why?). So, I made one. How does it work?\n\n### How It Works\nThis project uses `sqlite3` for the database and `flask_socketio` for the main \"logging in\" code. When a user logs on the page, a session is made with a unique UUID (a UUID, or a `universally unique identifier`, is a 128-bit label used for information). The user logs in by dragging a link into their bookmarks bar, then pressing it when they are on a Devpost window. The user is logged in, and can now delete the bookmark from their bookmarks bar. \n\n### Challenges I Ran Into\nI have used `SQL` before, but not python's `sqlite3` library, so I spent a good piece of my time figuring how to use it. I have used flask a lot before, so `flask_socketio` was easier than `sqlite3`, but it was still confusing.\n\n### Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of\nI actually finished the project (yay üéâ)! I was only planning to make a demonstration website on how the OAuth could be done, but I realized that wouldn't help __`you`__ that much, as no one could use it. I decided to make a `python` and `javascript üåê` library for other developers' usage.\n\n### The Python üêç Library\n```py\nfrom flask_devpost_oauth import DevpostAuth\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nfrom flask_socketio import SocketIO\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nsocketio = SocketIO(app)\nDevpostAuth(app, socketio)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/login')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('login.html')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)\n```\n###### Installation is `pip install flask_devpost_oauth`.\nThe code above is an example. You must pass both your socketio and flask app. If you are not using flask_socketio, just create and run the app, it won't affect your flask app. Using the library is as simple as that! The user information is *\"given\"* to the javascript code, not the flask app.\n\n### The JavaScript üåê Library\n```html\n<a id=\"bookmark\">Bookmark me!</a>\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://devpost-oauth-static.epiccodewizard.repl.co/script.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    function infofunc(info) {\n        alert(info);\n    }\n    main(\"https://mywebsite.com/\", \"bookmark\");\n    getinfo(infofunc);\n</script>\n```\n###### Installation is just using the script tag above.\nThe code above is an example HTML webpage. Because the time of the user login is unknown, the information is processed by a function, which takes in one argument, info. The information is alerted, in this case. \"https://mywebsite.com/\" is the URL of the flask server, using the python library. As explained earlier, the user clicks and drags the link, which is inserted in the link tag with the ID specified. In this case, the provided ID is \"bookmark\", which will get hyperlinked. Note: In this case, socket.io.js is version 2.2.0, but it can de any 1.x and 2.x version.\n\n### What I Learned\nI definitely learned a lot from this project. I learned a lot about web sockets and databases. This project was very fun to make, and I hope it helps other developers implement this in their own projects.\n\n##### Additional: Where does the information come from?\nIn a previous hackathon, I made a Devpost user information API, which gets all the possible information off a user's page. This library queries my API, returning information from it.\n\n*`That's it, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time....`*\n\n\n# [Official Demo](https://devpost-oauth.epiccodewizard.repl.co/)\n\n",
