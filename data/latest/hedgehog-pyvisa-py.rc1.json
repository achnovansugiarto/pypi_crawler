    "description": "PyVISA-py\n=========\n\nA PyVISA backend that implements a large part of the \"Virtual Instrument Software\nArchitecture\" (VISA_) in pure Python (with the help of some nice cross platform\nlibraries python packages!).\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nPyVISA started as wrapper for the NI-VISA library and therefore you need to install\nNational Instruments VISA library in your system. This works most of the time,\nfor most people. But NI-VISA is a proprietary library that only works on certain\nsystems. That is when PyVISA-py jumps in.\n\nStarting from version 1.6, PyVISA allows to use different backends. These backends can be\ndynamically loaded. PyVISA-py is one of such backends. It implements most of the methods\nfor Message Based communication (Serial/USB/GPIB/Ethernet) using Python and some well developed,\neasy to deploy and cross platform libraries\n\n.. _VISA: http://www.ivifoundation.org/Downloads/Specifications.htm\n\n\nVISA and Python\n---------------\n\nPython has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement controlling:\n\n- Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.\n- It represents a high abstraction level, which perfectly blends with the abstraction\n  level of measurement programs.\n- It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting modules for\n  data analysis and visualisation.\n- A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is available.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- Python (tested with 2.6 and 2.7, 3.2+)\n- PyVISA 1.6+\n\nOptionally\n- PySerial (to interface with Serial instruments)\n- PyUSB (to interface with USB instruments)\n- linux-gpib (to interface with gpib instruments, only on linux)\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\nUsing pip:\n\n    $ pip install pyvisa-py\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nThe documentation can be read online at https://pyvisa-py.readthedocs.org\n\n\npyvisa-py is written and maintained by Hernan E. Grecco <hernan.grecco@gmail.com>.\n\n\nOther contributors, listed alphabetically, are:\n\n* Alex Forencich <alex@alexforencich.com>\n* Alexander Bessman <bessman@kth.se>\n* Colin Marquardt <github@marquardt-home.de>\n* Lance McCulley <lancemcculley@gmail.com>\n* Martin Ritter <ritter@mpp.mpg.de>\n* Sebastian Held <sebastian.held@imst.de>\n* Thomas Kopp <20.kopp@gmail.com>\n* Thorsten Liebig <liebig@imst.de>\n* Tobias MÃ¼ller <Tobias_Mueller@twam.info>\n\n(If you think that your name belongs here, please let the maintainer know)\n\n\nPyVISA-py Changelog\n===================\n\n\n0.3 (unreleased)\n----------------\n\n- Nothing changed yet.\n\n\n0.2 (2015-08-25)\n----------------\n\n- Added support for TCPIP Socket.\n  (Issue #38, thanks Thorsten Liebig)\n- Added support for GPIB INSTR using linux-gpib.\n  (Issue #24, thanks bessman)\n- Added support for USB RAW.\n  (Issue #18, kopp)\n- Better error reporting when pyusb or pyserial is missing.\n- Fixed logging of unicode strings.\n  (Issue #54)\n- Fixed timeout in SerialSession.\n  (Issue #44)\n- Moved resource name parsing to PyVISA.\n- VXI11 protocol performance enhancement.\n  (thanks alexforencich)\n- Improved pyusb importing.\n- Fixed large binary reads in TCPIP.\n- Added backend information to logger.\n- Use pyvisa compat/struct.py for python < 2.7.8\n  (thanks Martin Ritter)\n\n\n\n0.1 (2015-02-08)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release. Preliminary support for:\n  - USB INSTR\n  - TCPIP INSTR\n  - ASRL INSTR",
