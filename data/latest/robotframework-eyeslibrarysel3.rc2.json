EyesLibrary uses a Python SDK called [Eyes-Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eyes-selenium) from the tool [Applitools Eyes](http://applitools.com/), and can be used with the [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and/or the [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) .\n\nThis library is a fork of [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes).\nIn order to use EyesLibrary, you are required to [sign up](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) for a free account with Applitools. See the [Usage](https://github.com/joel-oliveira/EyesLibrary#usage) section.\n\n- Information about EyesLibrary keywords can be found on the [Keyword Documentation](https://joel-oliveira.github.io/EyesLibrary/) page.\n\n- The [Applitools Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/eyes-selenium/) may be consulted in order to understand how Eyes works.\n\n- More information about the SeleniumLibrary can be found on the [SeleniumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html).\n\n- More information about the AppiumLibrary can be found on the [AppiumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://serhatbolsu.github.io/robotframework-appiumlibrary/AppiumLibrary.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following versions were used to test the library:\n\n- Python 2.7.14 or 3.6.0\n- Robot Framework 3.1.1\n- Eyes-Selenium 3.16.2\n- SeleniumLibrary 3.3.1 (For Web Tests)\n- AppiumLibrary 1.5.0.3 (For Mobile Tests)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended **installation** method is using [pip](http://pip-installer.org):\n\n    pip install robotframework-eyeslibrary\n\nTo **update** both the library and all\nits dependencies to the latest version:\n\n    pip install --upgrade robotframework-eyeslibrary\n\nTo install a **specific version**:\n\n    pip install robotframework-eyeslibrary==(DesiredVersion)\n\n#### Uninstall\n\nTo uninstall EyesLibrary use the following pip command:\n\n    pip uninstall robotframework-eyeslibrary\n\n## Directory Layout\n\n**EyesLibrary/**\n\n&ensp;&ensp;The Robot Framework Python Library that makes use of the Applitools Eyes Python SDK\n\n**tests/acceptance/**\n\n&ensp;&ensp;Test files to display what the keywords from EyesLibrary accomplish\n\n**docs/**\n\n&ensp;&ensp;Documentation for the EyesLibrary: Keyword Documentation and ChangeLog\n\n## Usage\n\nYou must create a [free account](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) with Applitools in order to run\nEyesLibrary and return results.\n\nThen, to use the library, follow [EyesLibrary Keyword Documentation](https://joel-oliveira.github.io/EyesLibrary/).\n\nThis is a Robot Framework library. If you're not familiarized with Robot Framework, \nplease consult [Robot Framework User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide).\n\n## Running the Demo\n\nAt _tests/acceptance_ directory, you can find Robot Framework tests for:\n\n- Web\n- Android Browser\n- Android Native App\n- Android Hybrid App\n- iOS Browser\n- iOS Native App\n- iOS Hybrid App\n\nBefore running the tests, your Applitools API Key must be set in _tests/acceptance/resources/common.robot_, by replacing \"YourApplitoolsApiKey\" with your own key.\n\nWhen running the mobile tests, you must replace the variables within _tests/acceptance/resources/mobile.robot_ with your own, as well as the ones in _tests/acceptance/resources/android.robot_ or _tests/acceptance/resources/ios.robot_, according to the OS in use.\n\nFor instance, you may want to use a different Remote URL than the one provided in the variables. So, if you are working with [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/), for example, you'd have to replace the Remote URL variable in _tests/acceptance/resources/mobile.robot_:\n\n    ${REMOTE URL}          http://${CREDENTIALS}@hub.testingbot.com/wd/hub\n\nBefore running the Android Hybrid App tests, you need to install the Demo App (APK found at _tests/resources_) in your device.\n\nFor in depth detail on how the keywords function, read the Keyword documentation found here: [Keyword Documentation](https://joel-oliveira.github.io/EyesLibrary/)\n\n**Remember to include your Applitools API key otherwise the\ntest will not run.** To run a test, open a command prompt within the _tests/acceptance_ folder and run:\n\n    robot FILENAME.robot\n\nFor example, to run the Test Suite for Web:\n\n    robot web.robot\n\n**Note:** It is assumed that anyone who wants to use this demo is already able to execute robot tests using SeleniumLibrary (for web tests) and/or AppiumLibrary (for mobile tests). The browser used to navigate with SeleniumLibrary is Google Chrome.\n\n## Things to Note When Using Applitools\n\n- The tests will be accepted automatically by Applitools Eyes after the first run because a new baseline is being created. A second test run will show a comparison between screens.\n- Changing the Applitools baseline parameters will create a new baseline, that is automatically accepted on the first run. (For more information, read the article: [What is a ‘baseline’ and how is a baseline created?](https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007188691-What-is-a-baseline-and-how-is-a-baseline-created-)\n- The viewport size should not be set to greater values than the maximum size of the device's window.\n(For more information on using viewports, consult [Using viewports in Eyes](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html))\n\n## Getting Help\n\nTo be defined. It might be helpful to read [Applitools Documentation](https://applitools.com/docs).\n\n## Credits\n\nEyesLibrary was forked from [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes) on version 1.2.\n\nRobot-AppEyes authors:\n\n- [Thomas Armstrong](https://github.com/tbarmstrong)\n- [Simon McMorran](https://github.com/SIMcM)\n- [Gareth Nixon](https://github.com/GarethNixon)\n- [Adam Simmons](https://github.com/adamsimmons)\n\nEyesLibrary then emerged as an independent library from the original one, on version 2.0.",
