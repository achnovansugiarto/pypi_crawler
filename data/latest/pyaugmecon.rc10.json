To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available [Python](https://www.python.org/) implementation.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Tests](#tests)\n- [Useful resources](#useful-resources)\n- [Notes](#notes)\n- [Known limitations](#known-limitations)\n\n## Installation\n\nPyAUGMECON can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) using `pip install pyaugmecon`. Detailed installation instructions for both [Anaconda](<#anaconda-installation-(advised)>) and [PyPI](#pypi-installation) installations are available below.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n- [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)\n- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [Cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle)\n- [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/)\n- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (other solvers currently not supported)\n\n> The [Gurobi Python bindings](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_mac/cs_python.html) are significantly faster than using the executable. So even if you have already installed Gurobi, please still install the Python version for an optimal experience.\n\n### Anaconda installation (advised)\n\nThis installation is advised as the PyPI installation of Gurobi does not include the licensing tools. Only Gurobi and Pyomo need to be installed as other tools are by default included in Anaconda or will be automatically installed as dependencies of PyAUGMECON.\n\n```bash\n# Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com\n\n# Install Gurobi\nconda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi\nconda install gurobi\n\n# Install PyAUGMECON, and dependencies\npip install pyaugmecon\n```\n\n### PyPI installation\n\nFor a PyPI installation, only Gurobi needs to be installed, other requirements will automatically be installed as dependencies of PyAUGMECON. As mentioned above, the PyPI version of Gurobi does not include licensing tools, see [Gurobi documentation](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-) on how to install these.\n\n```bash\n# Install Gurobi, PYAUGMECON, and dependencies\npip install gurobipy pyaugmecon\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, an optimization model generator function needs to be created to pass the model to PyAUGMECON. This function should return an unsolved instance of the optimization problem, see [Pyomo model](#pyomo-model). Essentially, the only difference in comparison with creating a single objective Pyomo optimization model is the fact that multiple objectives are defined using Pyomo's `ObjectiveList()`.\n\nThe rest of the process is automatically being taken care of by instantiating a `PyAugmecon()` object and solving it afterward with `PyAugmecon.solve()`.\n\n### PyAugmecon parameters\n\nInstantiating a `PyAugmecon(model, opts, solver_opts)` object requires the following parameters:\n\n| Name          | Description                                                                                             | Required |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| `model`       | Function that returns an

snippet shows how to solve the `3kp40` model from the `tests` folder:\n\n```python\nfrom pyaugmecon import PyAugmecon\nfrom tests.optimization_models import three_kp_model\n\n# Multiprocessing requires this If statement (on Windows)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    model_type = '3kp40'\n\n    # AUGMECON related options\n    opts = {\n        'name': model_type,\n        'grid_points': 540,\n        'nadir_points': [1031, 1069],\n        }\n\n    # Options passed to Gurobi\n    solver_opts = {}\n\n    A = PyAugmecon(three_kp_model(model_type), opts, solver_opts) # instantiate  PyAugmecon\n    A.solve() # solve PyAugmecon multi-objective optimization problem\n    print(A.model.payoff) # this prints the payoff table\n    print(A.unique_pareto_sols) # this prints the unique Pareto optimal solutions\n```\n\n### PyAugmecon object attributes\n\nAfter solving the model with `PyAugmecon.solve()`, the following object attributes are available:\n\n| Name                     |

Multiple example models can be found in the `tests` folder and a simple model can be found below:\n\n```python\ndef two_objective_model():\n    model = ConcreteModel()\n\n    # Define variables\n    model.x1 = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)\n    model.x2 = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)\n\n    # --------------------------------------\n    #   Define the objective functions\n    # --------------------------------------\n\n    def objective1(model):\n        return model.x1\n\n    def objective2(model):\n        return 3 * model.x1 + 4 * model.x2\n\n    # --------------------------------------\n    #   Define the regular constraints\n    # --------------------------------------\n\n    def constraint1(model):\n        return model.x1 <= 20\n\n    def constraint2(model):\n        return model.x2 <= 40\n\n    def constraint3(model):\n        return 5 * model.x1 + 4 * model.x2 <= 200\n\n    # --------------------------------------\n    #   Add components to the model\n    # --------------------------------------\n\n    # Add the constraints to the model\n    model.con1 = Constraint(rule=constraint1)\n    model.con2 = Constraint(rule=constraint2)\n    model.con3 = Constraint(rule=constraint3)\n\n    # Add the objective functions to the model using ObjectiveList(). Note\n    # that the first index is 1 instead of 0!\n    model.obj_list = ObjectiveList()\n    model.obj_list.add(expr=objective1(model), sense=maximize)\n    model.obj_list.add(expr=objective2(model), sense=maximize)\n\n    # By default deactivate all the objective functions\n    for o in range(len(model.obj_list)):\n        model.obj_list[o + 1].deactivate()\n\n    return model\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTo test the correctness of the proposed approach, the following optimization models have been tested both using the GAMS and the proposed implementations:\n\n- Sample bi-objective problem of the original paper\n- Sample three-objective problem of the original implementation/presentation\n- Multi-objective multidimensional knapsack (MOMKP) problems: 2kp50, 2kp100, 2kp250, 3kp40, 3kp50, 4kp40 and 4kp50\n- Multi-objective economic dispatch (minimize cost, emissions and unmet demand)\n\nThese models can be found in the **tests** folder and run with [PyTest](https://pytest.org) to test for the correctness of the payoff table and the Pareto solutions. Example: `pytest tests/test_3kp40.py`\n\n> Despite the extensive testing, the PyAUGMECON implementation is provided without any warranty. Use it at your own risk!\n\n## Useful resources\n\n### Original AUGMECON\n\n- G.

Nikas, A. Fountoulakis, A. Forouli, and H. Doukas, _A robust augmented ε-constraint method (AUGMECON-R) for finding exact solutions of multi-objective linear programming problems._ Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2020, no. 0123456789.\n- [GAMS implementation](https://github.com/KatforEpu/Augmecon-R)\n\n### Other resources\n\n- [The following PhD thesis is also very useful](https://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/gm/gmsite_gre/index_files/PHD_mavrotas_text.pdf)\n- [This presentation provides a quick overview](https://www.chemeng.ntua.gr/gm/gmsite_eng/index_files/mavrotas_MCDA64_2006.pdf)\n\n## Notes\n\n- The choice of the objective function(s) to add as constraints affects the mapping of the Pareto front. Empirically, having one of the objective functions with a large range in the constraint set tends to result in a denser representation of the Pareto front. Nevertheless, despite the choice of which objectives to add in the constraint set, the solutions belong to the same Pareto front (obviously).\n\n- If X grid points in GAMS, X+1 grid points are needed in PyAUGMECON in order to exactly replicate results\n\n- For some models, it is beneficial to runtime to reduce the number of solver (Gurobi) threads. More details: [Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/threads.html)\n\n## Known limitations\n\n- For relatively small models (most of the knapsack problems), disabling `redivide_work` and `shared_flag` should lead to slightly lower runtimes. This is due to the overhead of sharing the flag array between processes that don't have a shared memory space. Redividing the work results in additional models solved with duplicate solutions, leading to longer runtime. By sharing the flag array in a different way and dividing the work more smartly these limitations might be solved in the future.\n\n- To parallelize the solution process, the grid is divided into blocks with a minimum length of the inner loop (number of grid points) over the processes. With fewer than three objectives, there is only one dimension to iterate over, and as such no parallelization possible. This is something that can be improved in the future.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Citing\n\nIf you use PyAUGMECON for academic work, please cite the following [DOI (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/336300468).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis software was developed at the Electricity Markets & Power System Optimization Laboratory (EMPSOLab), [Electrical Energy Systems Group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/electrical-energy-systems/), [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/electrical-engineering/), [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/).\n\nContributors:\n\n- Wouter Bles (current version of the package)\n- Nikolaos Paterakis (initial implementation)\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n## 0.1.9\n\n- Again fix package dependencies to prevent breaking changes\n- Update dependencies\n\n## 0.1.8\n\n- Relax dependency requirements\n\n## 0.1.7\n\n- Remove default solver options when setting them to `None`\n\n## 0.1.6\n\n- Fix issue with mixed min/max objectives\n\n## 0.1.5\n\n- Fix dependency versions after issue with change in Pymoo API\n\n## 0.1.4\n\n- Incorrectly bumped version, no change from 0.1.3\n\n## 0.1.3\n\n- Trigger new release for Zenodo\n\n## 0.1.2\n\n- Move process timeout check to seperate thread to prevent a deadlock\n\n## 0.1.1\n\n- Add more detailed installation instructions to README and fix typos\n\n- Add CHANGELOG\n\n## 0.1.0\n\n- 🎉 First published version!\n\n- Alpha quality\n",
