    "description": "**Wyliodrin's [pybass](https://github.com/wyliodrin/pybass) folk** to increase ease of installation, import, and use.\n\n`pip install modpybass`\n\n\n#### pybass\n\nPython BASS Library with ctypes python module for BASS (http://www.un4seen.com).\n\nBASS is an audio library for use in Windows, Linux and MacOSX software. Its\npurpose is to provide the most powerful and efficient (yet easy to use),\nsample, stream, MOD music, and recording functions. All in a tiny DLL,\nunder 100KB in size.\n\nSee the documentation for descriptions of all the BASS functions. You\nshould also look at the included example program source-codes for some\nexamples of how to use BASS in your own programs.\n\n\n#### Win32 Requirements\n\nBASS requires DirectX 3 or above for output. BASS does not require that a\nsoundcard with DirectSound/DirectSound3D hardware accelerated drivers is\ninstalled, but it does improve performance if there is one. BASS also takes\nadvantage of MMX, which improves the performance of the MOD music playback.\n\n\n#### MacOSX Requirements\n\nOSX 10.3 or above is recommended. BASS uses CoreAudio for output, so there\nare no special library/driver requirements. BASS supports both PowerPC and\nIntel Macs.\n\n\n#### Main Features\n\n* Samples\n  supports WAV/AIFF/MP3/MP2/MP1/OGG and custom generated samples\n\n* Sample streams\n  stream any sample data in 8/16/32 bit, with both \"push\" and \"pull\" systems\n\n* File streams\n  MP3/MP2/MP1/OGG/WAV/AIFF file streaming\n\n* Internet file streaming\n  stream files from the internet, including Shout/Icecast\n\n* User file streaming\n  stream files from anywhere using any delivery method\n\n* Multi-channel streaming\n  support for more than plain stereo, including multi-channel OGG/WAV/AIFF files\n\n* MOD music\n  uses the same engine as XMPlay = best accuracy, speed, and quality\n\n* MO3 music\n  MP3/OGG compressed MOD music\n\n* Add-on system\n  support for more formats is available via add-ons (aka plugins)\n\n* Multiple outputs\n  simultaneously use multiple soundcards, and move channels between them\n\n* Recording\n  flexible recording system, with support for multiple devices\n\n* Decode without playback\n  streams and MOD musics can be outputted in any way you want\n\n* Speaker assignment\n  assign streams and MOD musics to specific speakers\n\n* High precision synchronization\n  synchronize events in your software to the streams and MOD musics\n\n* DirectX 8 effects\n  chorus/compressor/distortion/echo/flanger/gargle/parameq/reverb\n\n* User defined DSP functions\n  custom effects may be applied to musics and streams\n\n* 32 bit floating-point decoding and processing\n  floating-point stream/music decoding, DSP, FX, and recording\n\n* 3D sound\n  play samples/streams/musics in any 3D position, with EAX support\n\n* Small\n  BASS is under 100KB (on Windows), so won't bloat your distribution\n\n\n#### Using BASS\n\nThere is no guarantee that all future BASS versions will be compatible\nwith all previous versions, so your program should use BASS_GetVersion\nto check the version that is loaded. This also means that you should\nput the BASS module in the same directory as your executable (not just\nsomewhere in the path), to avoid the possibility of a wrong version being\nloaded.\n\nIf you are updating your software from a previous BASS version, then\nyou should check the \"History\" section (below), to see if any of the\nfunctions that you are using have been affected by a change.",
