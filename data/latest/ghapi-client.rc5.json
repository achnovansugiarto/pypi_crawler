For instance, you can retrieve basic information about your pull request as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom ghapi.pulls import Repository, PullRequest\n\npr = PullRequest(Repository(\"frgfm\", \"torch-cam\"), 187)\n# Get the PR information\npr.get_info()\n```\n```\n{'title': 'fix: Fixed zero division for weight computation in gradient based methods',\n 'created_at': '2022-09-18T17:08:50Z',\n 'description': 'This PR introduces an `eps` to all divisions in gradient methods to avoid NaNs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloses #186',\n 'labels': [{'id': 1929545961,\n   'node_id': 'MDU6TGFiZWwxOTI5NTQ1OTYx',\n   'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/frgfm/torch-cam/labels/type:%20bug',\n   'name': 'type: bug',\n   'color': 'd73a4a',\n   'default': False,\n   'description': \"Something isn't working\"},\n  {'id': 1929975543,\n   'node_id': 'MDU6TGFiZWwxOTI5OTc1NTQz',\n   'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/frgfm/torch-cam/labels/ext:%20tests',\n   'name': 'ext: tests',\n   'color': 'f7e101',\n   'default': False,\n   'description': 'Related to test'},\n  {'id': 1929975788,\n   'node_id': 'MDU6TGFiZWwxOTI5OTc1Nzg4',\n   'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/frgfm/torch-cam/labels/module:%20methods',\n   'name': 'module: methods',\n   'color': 'f7e101',\n   'default': False,\n   'description': 'Related to torchcam.methods'}],\n 'user': 'frgfm',\n 'mergeable': None,\n 'changed_files': 3,\n 'additions': 15,\n 'deletions': 8,\n 'base': {'branch': 'main', 'sha': '0a5e06051440e27de6027ec382517a2c71686298'},\n 'head': {'repo': 'frgfm/torch-cam',\n  'branch': 'grad-nans',\n  'sha': 'd49f4a3d847e130e99c3d20311e1450f074fd29f'}}\n```\n\nIf you're interested in reviewing the pull request, you might be interested in the code diff:\n```python\n# Retrieve the code diff\nfull_diff = pr.get_diff()\n# Print the first diff section\nprint(full_diff[\"torchcam/methods/gradient.py\"][0][\"text\"])\n```\nwhich yields:\n```\n-    def _get_weights(self, class_idx: Union[int, List[int]], scores: Tensor, **kwargs: Any) -> List[Tensor]:\n+    def _get_weights(\n+        self, class_idx: Union[int, List[int]], scores: Tensor, eps: float = 1e-8, **kwargs: Any\n+    ) -> List[Tensor]:\n```\n\n\n## Setup\n\n\nPython 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are required to install `ghapi`.\n\n### Stable release\n\nYou can install the last stable release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ghapi-client/) as follows:\n\n```shell\npip install ghapi-client\n```\n\nor using [conda](https://anaconda.org/frgfm/ghapi-client):\n\n```shell\nconda install -c frgfm ghapi-client\n```\n\n### Developer installation\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to use the latest features of the project that haven't made their way to a release yet, you can install the package from source:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/frgfm/ghapi.git\npip install -e ghapi/.\n```\n\n## What else\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://frgfm.github.io/ghapi/) for detailed specifications.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeeling like extending the range of supported API feature? Or perhaps submitting a new feature idea? Any sort of contribution is greatly appreciated!\n\nYou can find a short guide in [`CONTRIBUTING`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to help grow this project!\n\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the Apache 2.0 License.
