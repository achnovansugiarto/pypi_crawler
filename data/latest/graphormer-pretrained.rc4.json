    "description": "<img src=\"assets/logo-10.png\" width=100%> \n\nGraphormer is a deep learning package that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for molecule modeling tasks. It aims to accelerate the research and application in AI for molecule science, such as material discovery, drug discovery, etc. [Project website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphormer/).\n\n\n## This fork\n\n__The purpose of this fork is to package Graphormer for systematic uses and easier installation.__\n\nTo install, run `mamba install -c conda-forge 'graphormer-pretrained'`\n\nPlease refer to the original Graphormer github repo: https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer for any issues related to Graphormer. \n\n### What's different ?\n\n- We removed support for dgl due to packaging constraints\n\n__More information on the Graphormer project is available below !__\n\n\n\n## Highlights in Graphormer v2.0\n* The model, code, and script used in the [Open Catalyst Challenge](https://opencatalystproject.org/challenge.html) are available.\n* Pre-trained models on PCQM4M and PCQM4Mv2 are available, more pre-trained models are comming soon.\n* Supports interface and datasets of PyG, DGL, OGB, and OCP.\n* Supports fairseq backbone.\n* Document is online!\n\n## What's New:\n\n***12/22/2021***\n  1. Graphormer v2.0 is released. Enjoy!\n\n***12/10/2021***\n  1. **Graphormer** has won the [Open Catalyst Challenge](https://opencatalystproject.org/challenge.html). The technical talk could be found through this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKJX3Mpu3OA&ab_channel=OpenCatalystProject).\n  2. The **slides** of NeurIPS 2021 could be found through this [link](https://neurips.cc/media/neurips-2021/Slides/27679_XmkCZkZ.pdf).\n  3. The **new release** of Graphormer is comming soon, as a general molecule modeling toolkit, with models used in OC dataset, completed pre-trained model zoo, flexible data interface, and higher effiency of training.\n\n***09/30/2021***\n  1. **Graphormer** has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2021**.\n  2. We're hiring! Please contact ``shuz[at]microsoft.com`` for more information.\n\n***08/03/2021***\n  1. Codes and scripts are released.\n  \n***06/16/2021***\n  1. Graphormer has won the **1st place** of quantum prediction track of Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge (KDD CUP 2021) [[Competition Description]](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/pcqm4m/) [[Competition Result]](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/) [[Technical Report]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08279.pdf)   [[Blog (English)]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/transformer-stands-out-as-the-best-graph-learner-researchers-from-microsoft-research-asia-wins-the-kdd-cups-2021-graph-prediction-track/) [[Blog (Chinese)]](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/news/features/ogb-lsc) \n\n## Hiring\nWe are hiring at all levels (including FTE researchers and interns)! If you are interested in working with us on AI for Molecule Science, please send your resume to <a href=\"mailto:shuz@microsoft.com\" class=\"x-hidden-focus\">shuz@microsoft.com</a>.\n\n## Get Started\n\nOur primary documentation is at https://graphormer.readthedocs.io/ and is generated from this repository, which contains instructions for getting started, training new models and extending Graphormer with new model types and tasks.\n\nNext you may want to read:\n\n* [Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/tree/main/examples) showing command line usage of common tasks.\n\n\n## Requirements and Installation\n\n#### Setup with Conda\n\n```\nbash install.sh\n```\n\n\n\n## Citation\nPlease kindly cite this paper if you use the code:\n```\n@inproceedings{\nying2021do,\ntitle={Do Transformers Really Perform Badly for Graph Representation?},\nauthor={Chengxuan Ying and Tianle Cai and Shengjie Luo and Shuxin Zheng and Guolin Ke and Di He and Yanming Shen and Tie-Yan Liu},\nbooktitle={Thirty-Fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=OeWooOxFwDa}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
