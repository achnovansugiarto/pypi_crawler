    "description": "# voidgame\n\nVoid is my name for a board game I designed in college. This project is an interface for the rules of Void.\n\n- voidgame.State holds the data. \n\n- voidgame.process() does the work.\n\n```\npip install voidgame\n```\n\n## Rules of Void\nVoid is an abstract strategy board game for two players.\n\n### Components and Terminology\nVoid is played on a circular board. The central area of the board (the void) is encircled by five concentric rings (orbits). The innermost (first) orbit is the \"lowest\" while the outermost (fifth) orbit is the \"highest\". So, in Void, \"above\" means \"further out\" and \"below\" means \"further in\". Each orbit is divided into eighteen segments (sectors). These sectors are aligned so as to form eighteen \"vertical\" columns of five sectors. \"Orbital\" means either clockwise or counter clockwise within a single orbit. \"Diagonal\" means equal and simultaneous change in vertical and orbital directions (ie. through the corners).\n\nVoid requires two sets (black and white) of eight pieces: one flagship, two bombers, two sweepers, and three fighters. \n\n_initial setup_\n\n![Void Board Initial Setup](/pngs/void-board-initial-setup.png)\n\n### Play\nPlayers take turns (black first) moving one piece per turn. \n\nThe game ends when...\n\n- one player wins (by sending their opponent's flagship into the void)\n\n- there is a draw (because only the two flagships remain in play)\n\n- one player concedes\n\n### Movement\n\n#### The Flagship \n<img src=\"/pngs/void-flag-black.png\" alt=\"Void Flagship Piece (Black)\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n\nThe flagship may move orbitally to a neighboring unoccupied sector. The flagship may not move to a new orbit. It may not move further than one sector. It may not move into an occupied sector.\n\nAfter moving, the flagship may attack the first piece within three sectors along any orbital, vertical, or diagonal trajectory that belongs to the opposite color. The flagship may not attack until after it moves. It may not attack \"through\" an occupied sector. It may not attack further than three sectors away. It may not attack more than one piece.\n\nWhen the flagship attacks, its target must fall three sectors toward the void. (ie. From the fifth orbit to the second, from the forth to the first or into the void.)\n\n#### The Bomber \n<img src=\"/pngs/void-bomber-black.png\" alt=\"Void Bomber Piece (Black)\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n\nThe bomber may move to any neighboring unoccupied sector. The bomber may not move further than one sector and it may not move into an occupied sector.\n\nAfter moving, the bomber may attack all pieces directly below it. (ie. Below it in the same vertical column.) It must either attack all pieces directly below it (including pieces of the same color) or none of them.\n\nWhen the bomber attacks, its target(s) must fall entirely into the void.\n\n#### The Sweeper \n<img src=\"/pngs/void-sweeper-black.png\" alt=\"Void Sweeper Piece (Black)\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n\nThe sweeper may move one sector vertically or up to seventeen sectors orbitally. The sweeper may not move diagonally. It may not move further than one sector vertically. It may not move further than seventeen sectors orbitally. It may not move to or through any occupied sector.\n\nAfter moving orbitally, the sweeper may attack pieces immediately above the path of its move which belong to the opposite color. If the sweeper attacks one piece, it must also attack all other opposite-color pieces immediately above the rest of the path of its move, from the sector containing the first target piece to the sector above the sweeper.\n\nWhen the sweeper attacks, its target(s) must fall two sectors toward the void.\n\n#### The Fighter \n<img src=\"/pngs/void-fighter-black.png\" alt=\"Void Fighter Piece (Black)\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n\nThe fighter may move along any single diagonal trajectory. It may not move to or through any occupied sector.\n\nAfter moving along a clockwise diagonal trajectory (ie. up and clockwise or down and clockwise), the fighter may attack the first piece within two sectors clockwise if it belongs to the opposite color. After moving along a counter-clockwise diagonal trajectory (ie. up and counter-clockwise or down and counter-clockwise), the fighter may attack the first piece within two sectors counter-clockwise if it belongs to the opposite color.\n\nWhen the fighter attacks, its target must fall one sector toward the void.\n\n#### Falling\nIf a piece must fall through an occupied sector, the piece occupying that sector is not affected. If a piece must fall into an occupied sector, the piece occupying that sector must first fall one sector toward the void to make room. (There may be chain reactions.)\n\n\n\n",
