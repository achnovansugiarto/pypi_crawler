    "description": "Ice - WSGI on the rocks\n=======================\nIce is a Python module with a WSGI microframework meant for developing\nsmall web applications in Python. It is a single file Python module\ninspired by `Bottle`_.\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/susam/ice.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/susam/ice\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/susam/ice/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/susam/ice?branch=master\n\n\nWhy Ice?\n--------\nThis microframework was born as a result of experimenting with WSGI\nframework. Since what started as a small experiment turned out to be\nseveral hundred lines of code, it made sense to share the source code on\nthe web, just in case anyone else benefits from it.\n\nThis microframework has a very limited set of features currently. It may\nbe used to develop small web applications. For large web applications,\nit may make more sense to use a more wholesome framework such as\n`Flask`_ or `Django`_.\n\nIt is possible that you may find that this framework is missing a useful\nAPI that another major framework provides. In such a case, you have\ndirect access to the WSGI internals to do what you want via the\ndocumented `API`_.\n\nIf you believe that a missing feature or a bug fix would be useful to\nothers, you may `report an issue`_, or even better, fork this `project\non GitHub`_, develop the missing feature or the bug fix, and send a\npatch or a pull request. In fact, you are very welcome to do so, and\nturn this experimental project into a matured one by contributing your\ncode and expertise.\n\n.. _Bottle: https://bottlepy.org/\n.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/\n.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/\n.. _API: http://icepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ice.html\n.. _report an issue: https://github.com/susam/ice/issues\n.. _project on GitHub: https://github.com/susam/ice\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\nThis module should be used with Python 3.3 or any later version of\nPython interpreter.\n\nThis module depends only on the Python standard library. It does not\ndepend on any third party libraries.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nYou can install this module using pip3 using the following command. ::\n\n    pip3 install ice\n\nYou can install this module from source distribution. To do so,\ndownload the latest .tar.gz file from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ice,\nextract it, then open command prompt or shell, and change your current\ndirectory to the directory where you extracted the source distribution,\nand then execute the following command. ::\n\n    python3 setup.py install\n\nNote that on a Windows system, you may have to replace ``python3`` with\nthe path to your Python 3 interpreter.\n\n\nResources\n---------\nHere is a list of useful links about this project.\n\n- `Documentation on Read The Docs <http://icepy.readthedocs.org/>`_\n- `Latest release on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ice>`_\n- `Source code on GitHub <https://github.com/susam/ice>`_\n- `Issue tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/susam/ice/issues>`_\n- `Changelog on GitHub\n  <https://github.com/susam/ice/blob/master/CHANGES.rst>`_\n\n\nSupport\n-------\nTo report bugs, suggest improvements, or ask questions, please create a\nnew issue at http://github.com/susam/ice/issues.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis is free software.
