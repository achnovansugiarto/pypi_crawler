Visit FIW project page to download and learn more! \n        \n        [https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/)\n        \n        **Version 1.0**\n        \n        This document is incomplete, i.e., work in progress, as is the API itself.\n        \n        [![N|Solid](reports/teaser_image.jpg)](reports/teaser_image.jpg)\n        ------------\n        ## Overview\n        This API serves as the main code-base for kinship effort with FIW database. In addition, below is detailed description of database (i.e., data and label) structure.\n        \n        ## Families In the Wild (FIW) Data and Labels\n        This documentation describes FIW DB and (working) development kit. This is work in prgress (i.e., still to come are FIW-CNN models, updated benchmarks, more in README (this), and more).\n        \n        Check out FIW [project page](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/index.html)\n        \n        ### Download\n        Download [here](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/download.html)\n        \n        ### Details of the data\n        See pulications below.
