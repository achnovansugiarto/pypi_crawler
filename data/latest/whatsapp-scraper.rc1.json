Having a much longer lifetime and providing more security in its implementation.\n\n## How to install:\n###\n\nTo run you need chrome installed.\n```\npip install --upgrade selenium\npip install --upgrade webdriver-manager\n```\n\n### Example:\n```\nfrom whats_scraper import WhatsAppScraper\n\ntest=WhatsAppScraper()\ntest.login()\ntest.get_all_names_contacts()\ntest.get_my_contacts()\n```\n",
