Details on how to configure your domain for API access can be found on the [porkbun website](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api)\n\n## Configure Environment\nBefore using pyrkbun you will need to set a couple of envorinment variables to hold your API credentails.\n```\nexport PYRK_API_SECRET_KEY='sk_abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef'\nexport PYRK_API_KEY = 'sk_abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef'\n```\nBy default pyrkbun will utilise the default porkbun.com API endpoint which supports both IPv4 and IPv6. To force IPv4 only you can set an additional environement variable as follows.\n```\nexport PYRK_FORCE_V4=True\n```\nIf you are on a low latency path to the Porkbun service you may hit API rate limits and get 503 returned from the API resulting in ApiFailure exception being raised. You can set a rate limit environment variable to automatically add a delay in seconds before each API call. If this variable is not set no dealy will be addded.\n```\nexport PYRK_RATE=1.5\n```\nIf you would like pyrkbun to manage retries of API calls for you, simply set the retries environment variable with an integer representing the number of http retries on failed api calls. The default is zero.\n```\nexport PYRK_RETRIES=3\n```\n# Using pyrkbun in your python project\npyrkbun exposes all of the porkbun.com api functionality through a set of functions and classes. Functionality is grouped into sub-modules as follows:\n - **pyrkbun.ssl:** Operations related to certificate management.  Exposes a single function to reirieve certifcate bundle.\n - **pyrkbun.pricing:** Operations relating to retrival of domain pricing information. Exposes a single function to retrieve pricing information.\n - **pyrkbun.dns:** Operations relating to DNS management. This is the bulk of the functionality.\n\n## pyrkbun ssl\nRetrieve porkbun.com provided wildcard cert bundle for your domain.\n ```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n>>> x = pyrkbun.ssl.get()\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS',\n'intermediatecertificate': '<cert-data>',\n'certificatechain': '<cert-data>',\n'privatekey': \"<cert-data>\",\n'publickey': '<cert-data>'}\n\n ```\n## pyrkbun pricing\nRetrieve porkbun.com default domain pricing data.\n ```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n>>> x = pyrkbun.pricing.get()\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS',\n'pricing': {'de': {'registration': '5.55', 'renewal': '4.11',\n'transfer': '4.11', 'coupons': {'registration':\n{'code': 'AWESOMENESS', 'max_per_user': 1, 'first_year_only': 'yes',\n'type': 'amount', 'amount': 1}}},\n'xof': {'registration': '6.49', 'renewal': '21.94', ... }\n```\n## pyrkbun dns\nDNS comprises the bulk of the functionality of pyrkbun. The dns submodule defines a class for interacting with the DNS api. You can either instantiate class instances and use the exposed instance methods, or execute class methods to interact with the API without the need to instantiate a class instance.\n\nNOTE: When defining hostnames for A, AAAA, CNAME and ALIAS records, you should always provide the unqualified name. (e.g. if your domain is example.com, provide hostnames as 'www' not 'www.example.com').\n\n### dns class instantiation\nThe following example shows how to instantiate a class instance and create, update and delete a DNS record.\n ```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n\n# Instantiate class instance representing 'www' A record with IP of '198.51.100.45' and ttl of 620 in domain example.com\n>>> x = pyrkbun.dns('example.com',\n                    'A',\n                    '198.51.100.45',\n                    'www',\n                    '620',\n                    '0') \n\n# Call porkbun API to create DNS record from class data\n>>> x.create() \n{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'id': 253916852}\n\n# Update hostname\n>>> x.name = 'website' \n\n# Call porkbun API to update DNS record with new hostname\n>>> x.update()\n{'status': 'SUCCESS'}\n\n# Refresh record data held in class instance (in case updates were made out of band)\n>>> x.refresh()\n{'status': 'SUCCESS'}\n\n# Delete the record\n>>> x.delete()\n{'status': 'SUCCESS'}\n```\n\n### dns class methods\nThe following example shows how to create, update and delete a DNS record using the provided class methods.\n ```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n\n# Create dict containd data for a 'www' A record with IP of '198.51.100.45' and ttl of 620 in domain example.com\n>>> record = {'name': 'www',\n            'type': 'A',\n            'content': '198.51.100.45',\n            'ttl': '620',\n            'prio': '0'}\n\n# Call porkbun API to create record\n>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.create_record('example.com', record)\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'id': 253475380}\n\n# Create record containing updates\n>>> update = {'name': 'website',\n            'type': 'A',\n            'content': '198.51.100.45',\n            'ttl': '620',\n            'prio': '0'}\n\n# Call porkbun API to update DNS record\n>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.update_record('example.com', update)\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS'}\n\n# Delete the record by name and type\n>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.delete_record('example.com', 'A', 'www')\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS'}\n```\n\nA class method is exposed to collect existing domain records. The method will return a list of class instances for each record returned. Arguments can be provided to the method to select specific records or set of records to be returned. To collect all records for a domain simply provide the domain name as the only argument.\n```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n\n>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.get_records('example.com')\n>>> print(x)\n[Dns(domain='example.com', name='www', record_type='A',\ncontent='198.51.100.45', ttl='650', prio='0', notes='',\nrecord_id='253440859'), Dns(domain='example.com', .... ]\n```\n\n### Getting help on working with dns\nAll methods and functions are fully documented, additional detail on working with pyrkbun is available via the python help function.\n```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n\n>>> help(pyrkbun.dns)\n...\n```\n\n## pyrkbun ping\nPorkbun provides a simple API endpoint for polling the API and returning your current IP address. This can be useful for usecases such as dynamic dns record creation. This is exposed in pyrkbun as ***pyrkbun.ping***\n```python\n>>> import pyrkbun\n\n# Ping porkbun API and return IP\n>>> x = pyrkbun.ping()\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'yourIp': '2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'}\n\n# Ping porkbun API and force the use of IPv4\n>>> x = pyrkbun.ping(ipv4=True)\n>>> print(x)\n{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'yourIp': '198.51.100.45'}\n```\n\n# Using pyrkbun CLI from the terminal\nYou can utilise the functionality of pyrkbun directly from the terminal without the need to write your own python code.\n\nThe cli interface is availble using the command `pyrkbun`\n\nHelp is available from the command line\n```\n% pyrkbun -h\nusage: cli.py [-h] {ping,pricing,ssl,dns} ...\n\nCLI interface to the pyrkbun python library.\n        \nSet environment variables for API Key and API Secret Key to authenticate commands.\n\nFor API Key set:\n'export PYRK_API_KEY=<your_api_key>'\n\nFor API Secret Key set:\n'export PYRK_API_SECRET_KEY=<your_api_secret_key>'\n\npositional arguments:\n  {ping,pricing,ssl,dns}\n                        Pyrkbun Functions\n    ping                Poll API and return IP address\n    pricing             Retrieve pricing information\n    ssl                 Retrieve SSL bundle if available\n    dns                 Operate DNS records\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n```\n\n## pyrkbun cli ssl\nRetrieve porkbun.com provided wildcard cert bundle for your domain.\n```\n% pyrkbun ssl example.com\n{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\n\"intermediatecertificate\": \"<cert-data>\",\n\"certificatechain\": \"<cert-data>\",\n\"privatekey\": \"<cert-data>\",\n\"publickey\": \"<cert-data>\"}\n```\n## pyrkbun cli pricing\nRetrieve porkbun.com default domain pricing data.\n```\n% pyrkbun pricing\n{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\n\"pricing\": {\"de\": {\"registration\": \"5.55\", \"renewal\": \"4.11\",\n\"transfer\": \"4.11\", \"coupons\": {\"registration\":\n{\"code\": \"AWESOMENESS\", \"max_per_user\": 1, \"first_year_only\": \"yes\",\n\"type\": \"amount\", \"amount\": 1}}},\n\"xof\": {\"registration\": \"6.49\", \"renewal\": \"21.94\", ... }\n```\n## pyrkbun cli dns\n\n### get record(s)\nGet all records for a domain\n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com get\n[{\"name\": \"www\", \"type\": \"A\", \"content\": \"198.51.100.45\", \"ttl\": \"650\", \"prio\": \"0\", \"notes\": \"\", \"id\": \"253440859\"}, {\"name\": \"mail\", .... ]\n```\nGet a single record by ID\n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com get -id 253440859\n[{\"name\": \"www\", \"type\": \"A\", \"content\": \"198.51.100.45\", \"ttl\": \"650\", \"prio\": \"0\", \"notes\": \"\", \"id\": \"253440859\"}]\n```\nGet a single record by name and type\n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com get -name www -type A\n[{\"name\": \"www\", \"type\": \"A\", \"content\": \"198.51.100.45\", \"ttl\": \"650\", \"prio\": \"0\", \"notes\": \"\", \"id\": \"253440859\"}]\n```\n### create record\nCreate a new record - Operation status and new record ID will be returned \n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com create -name www -type A -content \"198.51.100.45\" -ttl 650\n{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\", \"id\": 256365177}\n```\nUtilise help for details on all available options `pyrkbun dns example.com create -h`\n### edit record\nEdit a record - Operation status will be returned\n\nRecords can be selected by either unique ID or by name and type.

The command requires an input json file, output file (to write operation results) and mode.\n\nThe following modes are supported:\n\n**add**: Add all records in the provided file.  \n**flush**: Delete ALL existing records and load records from provided file.  \n**merge (default)**: Update existing records and add new records if they do not yet exist. Records not specified in the file will remain unchanged and no records will be deleted. Existing records to be updated MUST include the record ID.\n\nExample usage:\n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com bulk ./records.json ./result.json -mode merge\n```\n\nExample input file:\n```json\n[\n// Existing record to be updated - note inclusion of ID\n// Record id's are only required when using the 'merge' mode and only for existing records to be updated with new data\n    {\n        \"content\": \"198.51.100.46\",\n        \"name\": \"www\",\n        \"ttl\": \"600\",\n        \"prio\": \"0\",\n        \"notes\": \"Company Website\",\n        \"type\": \"A\",\n        \"id\": \"256365177\"\n    },\n// New record to be created - id field is not required\n// When using the 'flush' or 'add' modes record id's are never required\n    {\n        \"content\": \"mail.example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"\",\n        \"ttl\": \"600\",\n        \"prio\": \"10\",\n        \"notes\": \"Primary MX Record\",\n        \"type\": \"MX\",\n    }\n]\n```\nNOTE: If you attempt to update a record with no changes the API will return an error\n#### **Include NS records in bulk operations**\nBy default, pyrkbun will exclude NS records from any bulk operations. If you would like to include these records you can set the '-incns' flag. \nExample usage:\n```\n% pyrkbun dns example.com bulk ./records.json ./result.json -mode merge -incns\n```\n## pyrkbun cli ping\nPorkbun provides a simple API endpoint for polling the API and returning your current IP address.\n\nPing utilising the default v4/v6 endpoint\n\n```\n% pyrkbun ping\n{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\", \"yourIp\": \"2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\"}\n```\nPing utilising the v4 only endpoint\n```\n% pyrkbun ping -v4\n{\"status\": \"SUCCESS\", \"yourIp\": \"198.51.100.45\"}\n```\n",
