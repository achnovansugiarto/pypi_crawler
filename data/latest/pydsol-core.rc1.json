    "description": "PYDSOL - Python Distributed Simulation Object Library\n=====================================================\n\nWhat is pydsol?\n    \n* pydsol is an open source suite for discrete-event simulation and\n  multi-formalism simulation.\n     \n* Originally it was programmed fully in Java, and it was introduced at \n  the Winter Simulation Conference in 2002.\n\n* The starting points for DSOL were that it should be possible to create \n  simulation models that are inherently distributed, and simulation models \n  that are built on the premises of object oriented principles.\n      \n* DSOL is based on Zeigler's (2000) framework for modeling and simulation, \n  which means that the basic entities in a simulation study are a model \n  and a simulator, governed for experimentation by an experiment. \n    \n* All these elements are present in the pydsol-core simulation framework: \n  the DSOLModel class that is extended by the user, the Simulator with \n  several implementations such as the DEVSSimulator, and the Experiment \n  class for defining the simulation experiment.\n\n\nImplemented formalisms\n======================\n    \nAt the moment, only the event scheduling formalism has been implemented in \npydsol-core. The process interaction, differential equations, flow modeling, \nclassical DEVS, Port-based DEVS, hierarchical DEVS, and agent-based modeling\nare all possible as extensions and will be added shortly. In the Java version\nof DSOL, differential equations, process modeling, and various DEVS variants \nwere implemented, which will be ported to Python.\n\n\nDSOL license\n============\n\nDSOL has an open source BSD 3-clause license.\n\n* Third party components used in DSOL can not have a license that is \n  more restrictive than permissive licenses such as BSD, Apache, MIT, \n  LGPL, Eclipse.\n\n* pydsol can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for \n  any use (educational, commercial, whatever).\n\n* pydsol may be extended or adapted by anyone into anything else \n  for any purpose.\n",
