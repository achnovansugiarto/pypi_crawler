Contrary to ``hg convert``\nproperly handle tags and branches.\n\ncvs2hg purpose\n------------------\n\ncvs2hg converts CVS repositories into Mercurial ones and\ndoes much better job than hg convert preserving appropriate\ntags and branchpoints contents.\n\nMost important case is that of manually tweaked tags.\nExample scenario::\n\n    cvs commit file1 file2 file3 file4\n    cvs tag blah_1-0-0      # covers 1.1 versions of all files\n    cvs commit file2 file3 file1    # makes 1.2\n    cvs commit file1        # makes 1.3\n    cvs tag -r blah_1-0-0 blah_1-0-1\n    cvs tag -F blah_1-0-1 file1\n\n(tag ``blah_1-0-0`` is created as copy of ``blah_1-0-0``, but manually\nmoved to newer version of ``file1`` – fairly frequent way of backporting\nbugfixes in CVS world, handy as it avoids CVS branch creation).\n\nEven simpler scenario: some tag (on purpose or accidentally) omits some files.\n\n``hg convert`` is lost in such cases. In aggregated history there is\nno point of time at which ``file2``, ``file3``, and ``file4`` were at\n``1.1``, but ``file1`` was at ``1.3``. So ``hg convert`` binds\n``blah_1-0-1`` at some random place (usually nearby initial revision).\n\n``cvs2hg`` resolves that by creating *fixup commit* - artificial\nchange which brings repository content in sync with tag being\nconverted (removes files which were omitted by cvs tag, applies\npartial changes to selected files only…). The net result is that::\n\n    hg up -r blah_1-0-1\n\ngives exactly the same files, with exactly the same contents, as::\n\n    cvs up -r blah_1-0-1\n\nThe cost is that history contains those commits - in most cases\ntiny triangular branches like::\n\n        |\n        o   \n        |\\  \n        | | \n        | |\n        | o [blah_1-0-1]   <--- fixup commit\n        |/  \n        |   \n        |\n        o \n        |\n\nThe same problem and solution applies to branches which started\nfrom such a tag (there fixup commit may init longer branch).\n\nSee also longer discussion in README.cvs2hg in the source code.\n\ncvs2hg installation\n---------------------\n\nInstall from pypi::\n\n    pip install cvs2hg\n\nor install from source::\n\n    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-cvs2hg\n\n    cd mercurial-cvs2hg\n    sudo python setup.py install\n\n(or install in virtualenv, or install locally using ``pip``).\n\ncvs2hg usage\n------------------\n\nUsual way to run the conversion:\n\n1. Grab ``,v`` files of module being converted somehow (you need read\n   access to the server CVS repository). To run the conversion,\n   you need the following directory tree (say you convert ``libs/acme`` which\n   has some files and also doc subdir)::\n\n       someWorkDir\n         |\n         +--- CVSROOT    (can be empty directory, just marks where root is)\n         |\n         |\n         +--- libs\n                |\n                |\n                +--- acme\n                       |\n                       +-- something.h,v\n                       |\n                       +-- something.c,v\n                       |\n                       +-- doc\n                             |\n                             +-- README.txt,v\n                             |\n                             +-- Attic\n                                   |\n                                   +-- BUGS.txt,v\n\n2. Run the command::\n\n       cd someWorkDir\n\n       cvs2hg --hgrepos=$HOME/repos/libs/acme \\\n             --encoding utf8 --encoding iso-8859-2 \\\n             libs/acme\n\n   (adapt encoding to your needs, that's list of encodings which could be used in commit\n   messages)\n\n3. Examine resulting Mercurial repository (with the command above it would be\n   ``$HOME/repos/libs/acme``). At times some history edition may make\n   sense (like dropping unnecessary branches or tags, or even\n   performing Mercurial to Mercurial conversion to modify usernames).\n\n\nSource code and it's history\n--------------------------------\n\n``cvs2hg`` was created by Greg Ward, as fork of ``cvs2svn`` (which,\ncontrary to it's name, handled also conversion to git and Bazaar),\nextended to support Mercurial. Later on it was patched by Marcin Kasperski\nto support newer Mercurial versions.\n\nAs the work was never merged back upstream, and presence of\n``cvs2svn`` script (and library) happened to cause confusion, the\nrepository was finally cleaned up from most non-Mercurial related code\nand exists now as purely CVS → HG conversion tool.\n \nCurrent repository:\n\n- https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-cvs2hg\n\nHistorical repositories:\n\n- https://bitbucket.org/Mekk/mercurial-cvs2hg (Marcin Kasperski patches until 2020) \n\n- http://hg.gerg.ca/cvs2svn (Greg Ward's repository)\n\n- http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2svn.html (original cvs2svn).\n\n\n",
