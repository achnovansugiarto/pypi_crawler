An internal counter keeps track of what numerical increment\n    to use when generating the next Id for an issue or a follow up.\n    This works like sequences in PostgreSQL and prevents reappearing URLs\n    when issues have been deleted.\n\n    New feature. title tag now reflects what page you're on.\n\n    Bug fixed. JPEG file attachments uploaded when using Internet Explorer used\n    a non-standard content-type. (Thanks Melvin Jacobson)\n\n    Bug fixed. File attachments that aren't file attachments can not be\n    uploaded. Before one could manually write anything in the file attachment\n    input box and it would be treated as a file. (Thanks Melvin Jacobson)\n\n    New feature. Much improved information page about StructuredText with\n    simple quick examples.\n\n    New feature. Temporarily uploaded file attachments are now stored inside\n    the issue tracker instance instead of the global /temp_folder which should\n    do away with some low level persistency errors in Zope2.7.x.\n\n    New feature. A button on the Management tab (ZMI) that updates everything\n    that deploys standards, updates the ZCatalog, assures all objects have\n    the correct attributes and clears temporary uploaded file attachments.\n\n    New feature. A new and improved Properties Wizard.\n\n    New feature. When showing issues, the urgency is explicitly styled if\n    anything else than 'normal'. E.g. 'critical' is shown in bold and red.\n\n    New feature. Whenever you add an issue, the selected sections you chose\n    become more \"popular\" since their position in the list of options is moved\n    up one notch.\n\n    New feature. File attachments that are images are uploaded now with\n    a little thumbnail if PIL is installed.\n\n    New feature. Added a RSS 1.0 feed as the default feed. The 0.91 feed\n    can still be reached on /rss-0.91.xml.\n\n    Bug fixed. Certain strictly Management pages weren't secured for Zope\n    managers only. Now they are.\n\n    Bug fixed. When you update the catalog manually from the Management tab\n    it logged lots of ERROR(200) messages which were not necessary and should\n    now not appear anymore.\n\n    New feature. ListIssues changed in layout and now also shows the first\n    couple of words from the issue description.\n\n    Bug fixed. Since Zope 2.5.x, when you add a ZCatalog it does not\n    automatically create a Vocabulary. Added that to InitZCatalog().\n\n    New feature. Improved the use of Recent history so the page templates\n    will now show them without having to create a Batch object. This will\n    decrease rendering time.\n\n    New feature. If you search an click a found issue, '?=' is not passed\n    in the URL but still works the same. More convenient for copy-and-paste\n    URLs without the search argument.\n\n    New feature. All templates are now interfaced as CheckoutableTemplates\n    (see http.//zope.org/Members/peterbe/CheckoutableTemplates)\n    This means that any IssueTrackerProduct instance's templates can easily\n    be customized without having to change any sourcecode and makes it\n    possible to install upgrades.\n\n    New feature. Almost all occurances of absolute URLs in the generated\n    HTML has been replaced by relative ones. This makes the resulting\n    HTML slightly smaller in size.\n\n    New feature. ListIssues and CompleteList is now much faster\n    if you are not doing a search. It was before doing a search on\n    nothing instead of using objectValues(). Great speed improvement.\n\n    New feature. POP3Account now has a configurable port number.\n\n    Bug fixed. POP3 was not working in Zope270 due to a bad class import.\n\n0.5.2 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    Bug fixed. Added View security on RSS feed.\n\n    Bug fixed. Removed the use of the variable 'yield' since this is now a\n    reserved keyword in Python 2.3.x\n\n    New feature. If you're logged in to Zope, your fromname and email\n    is stored so that if you loose your cookie but log in the same the\n    fromname and email is still there.\n\n    Bug fixed. preParseEmailString() in IssueTrackerUtils() could return None\n    when expecting list, now it returns [] in this case. Affected POP3.\n\n    Bug fixed. Email and followup action shown separatly now on\n    \"5 Latest Issues\".\n\n    Bug fixed. Sometimes the \"Notify the others\" on followup showed\n    incorrect results.\n\n    Bug fixed. Subscribers aren't automatically added to all next issues.\n\n    New feature. List Issues now shows what last happened in every\n    issue.\n\n    New feature. \"5 Latest Issues\" shows who posted the last followup.\n\n    New feature. If the submitter is in Always notify, he is not getting\n    the Always notify email.\n\n0.5.1 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    Bug fixed. AddIssue and QuickAddIssue wasn't properly implemented\n    with the ClassSecurityInfo() which would cause a \"unauthorized\"\n    error without login prompt if a parent object has the View\n    permission switched off.\n\n    Bug fixed. The accesskeys previously implemented didn't work\n    properly in Internet Explorer so I took it off until I know\n    more about adding accesskeys.\n\n    New feature. Accesskeys to the main tabs. Try for example. ALT + h\n\n    New feature. There is now a 'Show Always notify status' option\n    if you want to display which Always notify that have been notified.\n    Very useful to the \"issue adder\" if uncertain who gets to know\n    about the added issue. Default is off. See Advanced properties.\n\n    New feature. If you call rss.xml?show=all then it also shows\n    threads/follow ups are items with \"Followup to.\" added to the\n    title of the issue.\n\n    Bug fixed. rss.xml did not sort on 'issuedate' but on default\n    sortorder which could become confusing.\n\n    Bug fixed. When using your own statuses and the first one is not\n    'open', you would get an error when trying to add an issue when\n    not running as manager.\n\n    Bug fixed. When creating an issuetracker instance and using the\n    Properties Wizard some default boolean values were incorrectly\n    saved.\n\n    Bug fixed. Creation of emails was buggy because of spelling\n    misstake. It read '\\r\\b' when it should have been '\\r\\n'.\n\n    Bug fixed. Dodgy emails wheren't ignored properly. Now they are.\n\n    Bug fixed. \"(mail@peterbe.com) bla bla\" was converted to.\n    \"<a href=\"mailto.(mail@peterbe.com)\">(mail@peterbe.com)</a> bla bl\"\n    but now that is fixed.\n\n0.5.0b (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    New feature. When viewing an issue, the Add followup etc. buttons\n    is only shown at the top. At the bottom is a minial version of\n    the Add Followup form.\n\n    New feature. Now statuses are no longer hardcoded.\n    See the Properties tab where each line is a state,action combo\n    of statuses. Looking at the existing list it should be obvious\n    how it works.\n\n    New feature. Download button and the Confidential & Hide me\n    options are now by default hidden.\n\n    New feature. JavaScript encoded email hyperlinks. Idea taken from\n    http.//www.zope.org/Members/jmeile/email%20encoder\n    A new property has been introduced for this. See bottom of\n    Properties tab. This is **recommended** for public instances.\n\n    New feature. A simple Statistics page. It's linked from the Home\n    page if you're logged in as Manager or if you have switched of the\n    Private Statistics property.\n\n    New feature. Inbound emails now get a confirmation message sent\n    back. This is optional and for it to work you need to redeploy\n    standards to get the SendInboundEmailConfirm_script\n\n    Bug fixed. Accepting email objects can not be created if the\n    email address is already used as an always-notify to prevent\n    notifications becoming inbound email.\n\n    Bug fixed. Dodgy email attachments are now ignored thanks to an\n    added try & except statement.\n\n    New feature. When you upgrade the product some new properties\n    might have been introduced but not instanciated for. Visit the\n    Management tab and see the All properties header.\n\n    New feature. Inbound email via POP3. You can now set up one or\n    more POP3 accounts each with one or more email addresses that are\n    dedicated to sniff for emails sent to it that is converted to\n    issues.\n    It depends on the email package from http.//mimelib.sourceforge.net/\n    and if you want to strip HTML formatted emails you are advised to\n    install Strip-o-Gram from http.//www.zope.org/Members/chrisw/StripOGram\n    For this to work you are expected to set up some sort of cron job\n    to periodically check for new email.\n\n    Bug fixed. Lines that start with a URL or an email address turned\n    to e.g. c<a href=\"mailto.opyright@dot.com\">opyright@dot.com</a>.\n    Now that has been fixed.\n\n    Bug fixed. Removing several groups in the Notifyable groups now\n    works. Thank you Wolfgang Reinelt.\n\n    Bug fixed. Adding and removing other properties now work.\n\n    Bug fixed. Open option available when issue already Open.\n    (was because it tested if 'Open'=='open')\n\n    New feature. Added createIssueObject() method so that you'll be\n    able to create issue objects other than via the web.\n\n    New feature. Added Subscription to issues. See Properties tab to\n    enable this.\n\n    Bug fixed. Searching for name or email was before assumed AND,\n    but now it assumes OR.\n\n    New feature. File attachements to followups. See Properties tab.\n\n    Bug fixed. Improved getRoot() even more since last bug fix was\n    not sufficient.\n\n    Bug fixed. When pressing the Delete button you no longer get a\n    Javascript error.\n\n    Bug fixed. Improved getRoot() when using Virtual Hosts\n\n    Bug fixed. When pressing 'Save Changes' in the Properties tab the\n    page was returned completely blank. Now it \"redirects\" back to the\n    Properties tab as expected.\n\n    Bug fixed. ShowIssueData and the 'change these attributes' action\n    link was misspelled. Now fixed.\n\n    Gave up on the ReportLab module. CompleteList will have to suffice\n    for now.\n\n    Bug fixed. UpdateCatalog() now clears the catalog before it\n    reindexes all objects.\n\n    New feature. added showURL2Issue() which concatenates too\n    long URLs in ShowIssueData.\n\n    Bug fixed. Search highlight does now not mess with tags.\n    Try searching for 'strong' or 'p'. Before it looked odd.\n\n    Bug fixed. Latest issues on homepage is now latest issues.\n    Before it used cookie sortorders.\n\n0.4.9b (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    Improved \"5 latest issues\" to indicate followups.\n\n    Improved wording in batchlinks.\n\n    Improved search results so that it applies sorting based on the\n    actual search.\n\n    New feature.

Massive performance boost by using ZCatalog better\n    for fetching all recent issues and avoiding a python sort on no\n    more than 15 issues at a time. \n\n0.1.1 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    New feature. Show 20 items on the dashboard instead of 15\n    \n    New feature. The ability to ignore trackers and other\n    masscontainers is removed. It brings little value and much\n    confusion.\n    \n    New feature. Odd/Even columns coloured like inside\n    IssueTrackerProduct.\n    \n    Bug fixed. The continual lookup could sometimes keep adding the\n    same new issue(s) to the dashboard due to a difference between\n    the client-side (Javascipt) datetime and the server-side (Zope)\n\n0.1.0 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    New feature. Thanks to optimization the dashboard AJAX refresh\n    interval can go down to \n\n    New feature.

Masscontainer only counts issues, not join-in issues\n    in trackers that have this defined.\n\n0.0.9 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    New feature. Activity AJAX just gets the new issues since last\n    AJAX call.\n\n0.0.8 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    * major change to structure *\n    \n0.0.7 (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    Bug fixed.

The Masscontainer didn't properly listen to the \n    Security settings from Zope. Now it does, so if you disable\n    acquiring the View permission, then authentication is invoked.\n\n    New feature. RSS links to all issuetrackers\n\n0.0.2a (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    New feature. DeployStandards() which creates automate script.\n\n0.0.1a (2013-01-01)\n-------------------\n\n    First release",
