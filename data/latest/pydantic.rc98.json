validation and settings management using Python type hints.\n\nFast and extensible, *pydantic* plays nicely with your linters/IDE/brain.\nDefine how data should be in pure, canonical Python 3.7+; validate it with *pydantic*.\n\n## Pydantic Company :rocket:\n\nWe've started a company based on the principles that I believe have led to Pydantic's success.\nLearning more from the [Company Announcement](https://pydantic.dev/announcement/).\n\n## Help\n\nSee [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using `pip install -U pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.\nFor more installation options to make *pydantic* even faster,\nsee the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/) section in the documentation.\n\n## A Simple Example\n\n```py\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name = 'John Doe'\n    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None\n    friends: List[int] = []\n\nexternal_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}\nuser = User(**external_data)\nprint(user)\n#> User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]\nprint(user.id)\n#> 123\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor guidance on setting up a development environment and how

This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`.\n  Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never\n  stored as a huge list. This can save on both runtime and memory space, [#1642](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1642) by [@cool-RR](https://github.com/cool-RR)\n* Add `conset()`, analogous to `conlist()`, [#1623](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1623) by [@patrickkwang](https://github.com/patrickkwang)\n* make *pydantic* errors (un)pickable, [#1616](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1616) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\n* Allow custom encoding for `dotenv` files, [#1615](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1615) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\n* Ensure `SchemaExtraCallable` is always defined to get type hints on BaseConfig, [#1614](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1614) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\n* Update datetime parser to support negative timestamps, [#1600](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1600) by [@mlbiche](https://github.com/mlbiche)\n* Update mypy, remove `AnyType` alias for `Type[Any]`, [#1598](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1598) by [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin)\n* Adjust handling of root validators so that errors are aggregated from _all_ failing root validators, instead of reporting on only the first root validator to fail, [#1586](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1586) by [@beezee](https://github.com/beezee)\n* Make `__modify_schema__` on Enums apply to the enum schema rather than fields that use the enum, [#1581](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1581) by [@therefromhere](https://github.com/therefromhere)\n* Fix behavior of `__all__` key when used in conjunction with index keys in advanced include/exclude of fields that are sequences, [#1579](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1579) by [@xspirus](https://github.com/xspirus)\n* Subclass validators do not run when referencing a `List` field defined in a parent class when `each_item=True`.

This was done to support `BINARY(16)` columns in sqlalchemy, [#1541](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1541) by [@shawnwall](https://github.com/shawnwall)\n* Add a test assertion that
