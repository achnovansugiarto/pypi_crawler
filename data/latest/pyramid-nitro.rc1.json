    "description": "=============\nPyramid Nitro\n=============\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n\n  This package is currently in the \"planning\" stage. In short, much of\n  the conceptual parts of the package exist in disparate locations:\n  this package was created to bring those concepts together.\n\n\nThe `pyramid_nitro` package adds dependencies, useful libraries,\nsensible default configurations, \"glue code\", and other goodies to a\n\"standard pyramid application\" that makes developing pyramid\napplications fast... *super* fast. In short, it's the \"batteries\nincluded\" *opinionated* version of Pyramid_. It draws it's inspiration\nfrom the TurboGears_ application framework.\n\n\nProject\n=======\n\n* Homepage: https://github.com/canaryhealth/pyramid_nitro\n* Bugs: https://github.com/canaryhealth/pyramid_nitro/issues\n\n\nTL;DR\n=====\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install pyramid_nitro\n  $ nitro \"myapp\" /path/to/myapp\n  $ cd /path/to/myapp\n  $ nitro etc/dev.ini\n  Starting subprocess with file monitor\n  completed configuration of myapp/0.1.0-b [env=dev]\n  Starting server in PID 18330.\n  serving on http://0.0.0.0:9000\n\n\nOverview\n========\n\nThe objectives of `pyramid_nitro` are three-fold:\n\n* Trivial to get a completely functional application going\n* Lots of out-of-the-box functionality, but nothing that can't be disabled\n* Support for infinite scalability when needed\n\nSome of the opinions made to achieve that is that you'll:\n\n* expose and document API endpoints with pyramid_controllers_ and pyramid_describe_\n* parse and serialize HTTP requests with pyramid_input_ and pyramid_output_\n* validate and sanitize data formats with pyramid_armor_\n* authenticate requests with SAML or models with (TODO: to be determined)\n* perform access control with pyramid_authz_\n* paginate response datasets with pyramid_pagination_\n* use SQLAlchemy_ for your ORM model\n* store ORM data in PostgreSQL_ and big data in MongoDB_\n* send message bus events over RabbitMQ_\n* schedule asynchronous and deferred jobs with pyramid_scheduler_\n* manage configurations with pyramid_iniherit_\n* generate JavaScript, CSS, and images with pyramid_webassets_, lessc_\n* enable sessions and caching with pyramid_beaker_\n* encrypt data with GPG keys\n* thoroughly implement unit/integration/system tests with pyramid_test_\n* think globally but act locally with i18n\n* use Apache_ to infinity-scale your server\n* depend on microservices, such as:\n\n  * indexing and searching with Solr_\n  * URL-shortening with pyramid_tinyurl_\n\n\n\n\n.. _Pyramid: http://www.pylonsproject.org/\n.. _TurboGears: http://www.turbogears.org/\n.. _pyramid_controllers: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/\n.. _pyramid_describe: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_describe\n.. _pyramid_input: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_input\n.. _pyramid_output: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_output\n.. _pyramid_armor: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_armor\n.. _pyramid_authz: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_authz\n.. _pyramid_pagination: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_pagination\n.. _pyramid_scheduler: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_scheduler\n.. _pyramid_iniherit: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_iniherit\n.. _pyramid_webassets: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_webassets\n.. _pyramid_tinyurl: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_tinyurl\n.. _pyramid_test: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_test\n.. _lessc: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lessc\n.. _pyramid_beaker: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_beaker\n.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n.. _PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/\n.. _MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.org/\n.. _RabbitMQ: https://www.rabbitmq.com/\n.. _Apache: https://httpd.apache.org/\n.. _Solr: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/",
