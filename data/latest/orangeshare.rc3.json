    "description": "# Orange Share\nA small python server that accepts requests from an Apple shortcut to allow sharing all sorts of media from iOS with any desktop OS.\nIt allows sending content right from the share sheet - similar to AirDrop between Apple Devices\n\n## How it works\nOrange Share consists of a webserver that should be able to run on any computer operating system and a few Shortcuts\nthat allow the user to open, save and copy content from an iPhone or iPad to a computer as well as request data from the computer.\n\nThe shortcuts will show up in the share sheet of files, links etc. and allow you to share whatever the content is with\nthe computer it is set up with.\n\n<img alt=\"share_sheet\" src=\"images/share_sheet.png\" title=\"share_sheet\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nBy default, you can access the UI with settings for Orange Share on [localhost:7616](http://localhost:7616).\nHere you can also find the shortcuts and establish connections to the devices.\nThe UI is only accessible from the host.\n\nThe API which is used by the mobile devices is opened on port 7615 by default.\nIt is accessible from devices in the network and secured with Basic Auth.\nThis means that only connected devices are able to send data to the computer.\nNote that due to the http protocol, connection data will be sent over unencrypted connections.\nOrange Share never sends out any data from the computer without a confirmation on the computer,\neven if the correct credentials are set.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\nChoose one of the following methods of installation depending on the system you want to install on.\n\n#### Windows\n\nGo to the [releases](https://github.com/Yannis4444/Orange-Share/releases),\ndownload the newest Orange Share executable (`orangeshare-x.x.x.exe`)\nand run the installer.\n\nThis Version of Orange Share will show an icon in the system tray (lower right corner; may be hidden behind the up arrow).\nThe Tray Icon offers a right click menu to start, stop and exit Orange Share.\n\nIt also allows you to add Orange Share to Windows startup when installing.\nIf you enable this option Orange Share will start as inactive and can be activated from the tray.\n\n#### GNOME Shell Extension\n\nA GNOME Shell Extension is available [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4469/orange-share/).\n\nWhen first enabling Orange Share by clicking the icon in the top bar, you will be prompted to install the python package.\nI was not allowed to host the python part on the GNOME Shell Extension page which is why installing and updating will be taken care of using pip.\n\nOnce everything is installed, you can enable and disable Orange Share by clicking on an icon in the top bar.\nRight-click will open a short menu with some options and double-clicking the icon will open the settings in your browser.\n\n#### Using PIP\n\nOrange Share can be installed by running `pip install orangeshare`.\n\nAfter that, it can be run using the command `python -m orangeshare` or just `orangeshare` on Linux.\n\n### Downloading the Shortcuts\n\nTo use Orange Share you will need a few Shortcuts.\nThese can be downloaded right from the user interface by scanning the QR codes with the camera app on your iPhone/iPad.\n\nThere are different Shortcuts with different functions.\nHere I will only go over the basics you need to know to get started.\nYou can find a more in depth description in the user interface and [below](https://github.com/Yannis4444/Orange-Share#shortcuts.\n\nIf you run into problems with \"untrusted shortcuts\" take a look at [this](https://github.com/Yannis4444/Orange-Share#untrusted-shortcuts).\nThis is a security mechanism from Apple to make sure users do not just run any shortcut.\n\n### Connecting a Device to the Computer\n\nAll the communication between the shortcuts and the computer use Basic Auth to avoid unauthorised requests.\nTherefore, you need to create a new connection under Connected Devices in the settings.\n\nThere you can set the name of your computer which is only relevant for display purposes on the devices and the IP address of your computer.\nThe IP will be saved in combination with your WiFi name.\nThis means that you can set different IPs for different Networks.\nIf you are unsure which IP is the right one just go through them until one works.\n\nTo add a connection click ADD and then enter a name for the connection.\nClick ADD again and scan the resulting QR code using the Connection Manager Shortcut (Scann QR Code).\nThis will establish and test the connection.\n\nYou can manage connected devices from this shortcut as well.\nTo connect to a computer you can also simply scan the QR code again.\n\nIf you wish to synchronise your connection between your devices you can set to do so using iCloud here too.\n\n<img alt=\"add_connection\" src=\"images/add_connection.png\" title=\"add_connection\" width=\"400\"/>\n\n### Sharing Data\n\nOnce everything is set up, you can choose any content you wish to share on your iPhone/iPad (like a photo) and click share.\nThere you should find the different Orange Share options.\n\nIf you wish to have Orange Share always appear on top you can use `Edit Actions...` at the bottom of this list.\n\n### Requesting Data from the Computer\n\nThere is also the `Get Data` Shortcut which allows you to request data from the computer.\n\n<img alt=\"Get Data Dialog\" src=\"images/get_data.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nYou have now completed the basic steps to set up Orange Share and should be able to share content between you devices.\nIf you encounter any problems please let me know by creating an issue.\n\n## Updating\n\nOnce a new version of Orange Share is available, you will be notified.\nYou can of cause ignore this if you wish to - I will not force you to update.\n\nThe Windows and GNOME Shell Extension versions can be updated right from the user interface.\nInstructions on how to do so will be shown there as well.\n\nThe pip version can be updated just like any pip package by calling `pip install --upgrade orangeshare`.\n\n## Shortcuts\n\nOrange Share uses several [shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) for different parts of its functionality.\nThese shortcuts have to be installed on the device from which content shall be shared.\n\nThe shortcuts can be found in the UI of the application or below.\n\n#### Untrusted Shortcuts\n\nTo import the needed shortcuts, you might need to enable `Allow Untrusted Shortcuts` in your devices settings.\nThis option can be found in `Settings > Shortcuts`.\n\nIf you have never before used Shortcuts, chances are, that `Allow Untrusted Shortcuts` is grayed out.\nIf this is the case, you have to run a shortcut first.\nTo do this, open the Shortcuts App and choose any of the available shortcuts or create one yourself.\nOnce you ran a shortcut, the option to enable untrusted shortcuts should become available.\n\n#### How to use the Shortcuts\n\nOnce the shortcuts are installed, they are shown in the Shortcuts App.\nHere you can start or edit them.\nWhen you run a shortcut that sends data to the computer here, it will send the contents of your clipboard.\n\nYou can find most shortcuts in the share sheets of the device.\nThis means that whenever you click `share` on the device you can find these shortcuts in the list.\nAt the bottom of this list you can find an option to edit the shown entries.\nHere you can add the Orange Share shortcuts to your favorites if you want them to always be at the top.\n\n### Connection Manager\n\nThis shortcut is always needed to manage the connections to the host computer running Orange Share.\nIt has to be run directly from the Shortcuts App or added to the home screen and run from there.\nIt is also possible to add this as a back tap action for easier access.\n\nThe device is able to save multiple connections while only one can be active at a time.\nIn order to do so, some files will be created on your iCloud (`/Shortcuts/orangeshare/`).\n\n[Download](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c80782d8c8954b1f96de6784441fb9a6)\n\n### Open\n\nThe open shortcut will open content in its respective application on the computer.\n\nFor URLs, it will open the website in the default browser, any other files will be opened in their default applications.\nTo make this work, files are saved in a temporary folder.\n\n[Download](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ebc4cd8ec7954ac68f723d79fdf30276)\n\n### Save\n\nThe save shortcut will open a save-file-dialog on the computer with which shared content can be saved anywhere on the computer.\n\n[Download](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ca1d351c41e14806b40c21c995a8f4f0)\n\n### Clipboard\n\nThe clipboard shortcut will copy any text to the clipboard of the computer.\nOnce copied, it can be pasted anywhere.\n\nCopying files will be coming soon.\n\n[Download](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7f10334354f9479aaf156139383f3a73)\n\n### Get Data\n\nThis shortcut can be used to get data from the computer.\nIt will open a window on the computer where either a file or the current clipboard content can be sent to the phone.\n\n[Download](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f1e9e2f318f447508ab956884936c614)\n\n## Advanced Options\n\n### Run Options\n\nArgument | Description\n---------|------------\n-h, --help | print a help message\n--version | print the current version\n-p \\<port\\>, --api-port \\<port\\> | Port number of the api server (default: 7615)\n-u \\<port\\>, --ui-port \\<port\\> | Port number of the UI server (default: 7616)\n-o, --open-ui | Open the server controls in the browser on start\n-t, --tray-icon | Run with tray icon (only available on windows, see [Gnome Shell Extension](#gnome-shell-extension) for Linux with Gnome)\n-v, --verbose | enable Verbose output\n\n\n### Linux Autostart\n\nTo run Orange Share at system startup you can copy the `orange-share.desktop` to the `~/.config/autostart` directory.\n\nAutostart for windows and GNOME can be handled by the installer and the extension.\n\n## Configuration\n\nA configuration file can be found in the user's config directory.\nOn Linux for example this would be `~/.config/orangeshare/config.ini`.\nThe file location will also be shown in the web UI.\n\nOnce changed you will have to restart Orange Share.\n\n",
