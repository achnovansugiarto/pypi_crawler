Free for open source projects!\n\nUsage\n------\n\nLet's pretend you want to create a Django project called \"redditclone\". Rather than using `startproject`\nand then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.\n\nFirst, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::\n\n    $ pip install \"cookiecutter>=1.4.0\"\n\nNow run it against this repo::\n\n    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django\n\nYou'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.\n\n**Warning**: After this point, change 'Daniel Greenfeld', 'pydanny', etc to your own information.\n\nAnswer the prompts with your own desired options_. For example::\n\n    Cloning into 'cookiecutter-django'...\n    remote: Counting objects: 550, done.\n    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (310/310), done.\n    remote: Total 550 (delta 283), reused 479 (delta 222)\n    Receiving objects: 100% (550/550), 127.66 KiB | 58 KiB/s, done.\n    Resolving deltas: 100% (283/283), done.\n    project_name [Project Name]: Reddit Clone\n    project_slug [reddit_clone]: reddit\n    author_name [Daniel Roy Greenfeld]: Daniel Greenfeld\n    email [you@example.com]: pydanny@gmail.com\n    description [A short description of the project.]: A reddit clone.\n    domain_name [example.com]: myreddit.com\n    version [0.1.0]: 0.0.1\n    timezone [UTC]: America/Los_Angeles\n    use_whitenoise [y]: n\n    use_celery [n]: y\n    use_mailhog [n]: n\n    use_sentry_for_error_reporting [y]: y\n    use_opbeat [n]: y\n    use_pycharm [n]: y\n    windows [n]: n\n    use_docker [y]: n\n    use_heroku [n]: y\n    use_compressor [n]: y\n    Select postgresql_version:\n    1 - 9.5\n    2 - 9.4\n    3 - 9.3\n    4 - 9.2\n    Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4 [1]: 1\n    Select js_task_runner:\n    1 - Gulp\n    2 - Grunt\n    3 - None\n    Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4 [1]: 1\n    Select open_source_license:\n    1 - MIT\n    2 - BSD\n    3 - GPLv3\n    4 - Apache Software License 2.0\n    5 - Not open source\n    Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [1]: 1\n\nEnter the project and take a look around::\n\n    $ cd reddit/\n    $ ls\n\nCreate a git repo and push it there::\n\n    $ git init\n    $ git add .\n    $ git commit -m \"first awesome commit\"\n    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/redditclone.git\n    $ git push -u origin master\n\nNow take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?\n\nFor local development, see the following:\n\n* `Developing locally`_\n* `Developing locally using docker`_\n\n.. _options: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-generation-options.html\n.. _`Developing locally`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html\n.. _`Developing locally using docker`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally-docker.html\n\nCommunity\n-----------\n\n* Have questions? **Before you ask questions anywhere else**, please post your question on `Stack Overflow`_ under the *cookiecutter-django* tag.

The reason for that is this project, amongst other things, serves as a test bed for trying out new ideas and concepts. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but the end result is that it won't necessarily match precisely what is described in the book I co-authored.\n\nFor pyup.io Users\n-----------------\n\nIf you are using `pyup.io`_ to keep your dependencies updated and secure, use the code *cookiecutter* during checkout to get 15% off every month.\n\n.. _`pyup.io`: https://pyup.io\n\n\"Your Stuff\"\n-------------\n\nScattered throughout the Python and HTML of this project are places marked with \"your stuff\".
