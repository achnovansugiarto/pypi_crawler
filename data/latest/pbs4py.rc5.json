    "description": "# Description\n\npbs4py is a Python module for automating submission of compute jobs on High Performance\nComputing clusters, such as those that use the Portable Batch System (PBS).\nIt includes pre-configured launchers for common NASA HPC systems: the Langley K cluster\nand NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) systems.\n\nExamples uses are uncertainty quantification where many jobs are submitted\nsimultaneously or optimization where sequences of jobs need to scripted.\n\npbs4py also includes scripts for performing tasks associated with PBS jobs\nsuch as a script when given a job number will print the directory from which it was launched\nand a script that can delete multiple jobs based on filters.\n\n\n# Documentation\n[Documentation is hosted using Github Pages](https://nasa.github.io/pbs4py/)\n\nThe pbs4py documentation is generated from the source code with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).\nOnce you have installed pbs4py, the documentation is built by running `make html` in the docs directory.\nThe generated documentation will be in `docs/build/html`.\n\n# Installation\npbs4py can be installed with\n\n```\npip install pbs4py\n```\n\n# Quick Start\n\nAfter installation,\n\nOn the K cluster:\n```python\nfrom pbs4py import PBS\npbs = PBS.k4()\npbs.requested_number_of_nodes = 1\npbs.launch(job_name='example_job',job_body=['echo \"Hello World\"'])\n```\n\nOn NAS:\n```python\nfrom pbs4py import PBS\ngroup = 'a1111' # your project ID to charge here\npbs = PBS.nas(group, proc_type='san', queue='devel', time=1)\npbs.launch(job_name='example_job',job_body=['echo \"Hello World\"'])\n```\n\n# License Notices and Disclaimers\nNotices:\nCopyright 2022 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
