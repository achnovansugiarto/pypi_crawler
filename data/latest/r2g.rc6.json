Of course [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) needs to be installed first.\n\n```bash\n# Install miniconda3:\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\nsh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n# Set up bioconda channel (or its mirrors):\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\n# Install r2g:\nconda install -c yangwu91 r2g\n```\n\nAfter that, [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (or [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image) need to be installed.\n\nIn the future, I plan to create a pull request to the Bioconda recipes.\n\n### Installing with Homebrew for macOS users\n\n*Progress*:\n\n- [x] Build Homebrew Formula\n- [x] Init a pull request to the `brewsci/bio` Tap.\n- [ ] Be permitted by the `brewsci/bio` Tap.\n\nSince the r2g formula is still waiting for the approval from the the `brewsci/bio` Tap, macOS users can download the r2g formula and add it manually on your local computer.\n\n```\n# Install Homebrew and add the tap\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\nbrew tap brewsci/bio\n# Download the r2g formula and put it in the correct directory:\n/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.72.0/bin/curl -o /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/brewsci/homebrew-bio/Formula/r2g.rb -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangwu91/r2g/master/brewsci-Formula/r2g.rb\n# Install r2g:\nbrew install r2g\n```\n\nAnd then [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (or [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image) need to be installed.\n\n### Manual installation for all platforms\n\n#### Required third-party applications\n\nThe r2g required 3 third-party software packages including [NCBI SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools), [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq), and [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (or [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image). \n\n1. NCBI SRA Toolkit\n\n   - Download pre-built binaries for **all platforms** [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit) or compile the source code [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/releases) by yourself.\n\n   * For **Linux** and **macOS** users, it also can be installed using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) via the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel:\n\n     ```bash\n     conda install -c bioconda sra-tools\n     ```\n\n     If the installed version of SRA Toolkit is above 2.10.3, before the first run you have to execute the follow command:\n\n     ```bash\n     vdb-config --interactive\n     ```\n\n     Then press `x` to set up the default configs. This is a known annoying [issue](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/issues/291) that can't be avoided.\n\n\n2. Trinity\n\n   * Follow the [instruction](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki/Installing-Trinity) to compile the source code. Please note that Trinity has its own dependencies, including [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), [jellyfish](http://www.genome.umd.edu/jellyfish.html), [salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html), and [trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic). If you are a macOS user while compiling Trinity, please use `gcc` compiler instead of native `clang` complier on macOS to avoid raising errors.\n\n   * For **macOS** users, Trinity can be installed using Homebrew as well:\n\n     ```bash\n     brew tap brewsci/bio\n     brew install trinity\n     ```\n\n\n\n   * For **Linux** users, Trinity can be installed easily using Conda, and you would never worry about other dependencies:\n\n     ```bash\n     conda install -c bioconda trinity=2.8.5 numpy samtools=1.10\n     ```\n\n     The compatibility of Trinity **Version 2.8.5** with r2g has been fully tested, and theoretically, the later versions should work too.\n\n3. Google Chrome web browser with ChromeDriver\n\n   * Install [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and then download the corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). \n\n   * Or, you can simply run [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image in background (make sure you have the permission to bind the 4444 port on local host):\n\n     ```bash\n     docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome\n     ```\n\n\n#### Installing the r2g package\nThe r2g package has been deposited to PyPI, so it can be installed as follows:\n\n```\npip install r2g\n```\n\n#### Setting up the environment\n\nIf these required third-party applications above are installed using Conda, you don't need to take care of it. \n\nIf these packages are compiled or downloaded by yourself, either include them in `$PATH` separately by a command as follows:\n\n```\n# Linux and macOS:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/fastq-dump:/path/to/Trinity:/path/to/chromedriver\"\n# Windows:\nset PATH=%PATH%;DRIVER:\\path\\to\\fastq-dump;DRIVER:\\path\\to\\Trinity;DRIVER:\\path\\to\\chromedriver\n```\n\nor follow the prompts to set up the path to the executable files manually before the first run. And then, you are good to go.\n\n## System requirements\n\nThe recommended minimal hardware specifications are **2-core CPU** and **4 Gb memory**, which are satisfied for most common personal computers nowadays.\n\n## Usage\n\nDetailed usage will be printed by the command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it yangwu91/r2g:latest --help\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```bash\nr2g --help\n```\n\n```\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -V, --version         Print the version.\n  -v, --verbose         Print detailed log.\n  -r [INT], --retry [INT]\n                        Number of times to retry.Enabling it without any numbers will force it to keep retrying. Default: 5.\n  --cleanup             Clean up all intermediate files and only retain the final assembled contig file in FASTA format.\n  -o DIR, --outdir DIR  Specify an output directory. Default: current working directory.\n  -W DIR, --browser DIR\n                        Temporarily overwrite the local path or the remote address of the chrome webdriver. E.g., /path/to/chromedriver or http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub\n  -P SCHEME://IP:PORT, --proxy SCHEME://IP:PORT\n                        Set up proxies. Http and socks are allowed, but authentication is not supported yet (still testing).\n\nNCBI options:\n  -s SRA, --sra SRA     Choose SRA accessions (comma-separated without blank space). E.g., \"SRX885418\" (an SRA experiment) or \"SRR1812886,SRR1812887\" (SRA runs)\n  -q SEQUENCE, --query SEQUENCE\n                        Submit either a FASTA file or nucleotide sequences.\n  -p BLAST, --program BLAST\n                        Specify a BLAST program: tblastn, tblastx, or blastn (including megablast, blastn, and discomegablast). Default: blastn.\n  -m INT, --max_num_seq INT\n                        Maximum number of aligned sequences to retrieve (the actual number of alignments may be greater than this). Default: 1000.\n  -e FLOAT, --evalue FLOAT\n                        Expected number of chance matches in a random model. Default: 1e-3.\n  -c FRAGMENT,OVERLAP, --cut FRAGMENT,OVERLAP\n                        Cut sequences and query them respectively to prevent weaker matches from being ignored. Default: 70,20 (nucleotides), or 24,7 (amino acids)\n\nTrinity options:\n  -t INT, --CPU INT     Number of CPU threads to use. Default: the total number of your computer.\n  --max_memory RAM      Suggest max Gb of memory to use by Trinity. Default: 4G.\n  --min_contig_length INT\n                        Minimum assembled contig length to report. Default: 150.\n  --trim [TRIM_PARAM]   Run Trimmomatic to qualify and trim reads. Using this option without any parameters will trigger preset settings in Trinity for Trimmomatic. See Trinity for more help. Default: disabled.\n  --stage {no_trinity,jellyfish,inchworm,chrysalis,butterfly}\n                        Stop Trinity after the stage you chose. Default: butterfly (the final stage).\n```\n\n### Specific options for running the Docker image\n\nWhile executing the Docker image, some specific options are required: `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm`, `-v /path/to/your/workspace:/workspace`, and `-u $UID`. \n\n* The option `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm` shares host's memory to avoid applications crashing inside a Docker container. \n\n- The option `-v /path/to/your/workspace:/workspace` mounts the local directory `/path/to/your/workspace` (specify your own) to the working directory `/workspace` (don't change it) inside a Docker container, **which is the input and output directory**.\n\n- The option `-u $UID` sets the owner of the Docker outputs. **Ignoring it will raise permission errors**.\n\nLet's say there is a query file in FASTA format named `QUERY.fasta` in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/`. As a result, the the simplest full command to run a Docker image should be:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /home/user/r2g_workspace:/workspace -u $UID yangwu91/r2g:latest -o OUTPUT -q QUERY.fasta -s SRXNNNNNN\n```\n\nAfter that, you can check out the results in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/OUTPUT/`.\n\n### An example: finding the \"non-existent\" *S6K* gene in a mosquito species\n\nWe applied the r2g pipeline to search the gene *S6K* (i.e. `AAEL018120` from *Aedes aegypti*, which is a well-studied species) in *Aedes albopictus* SRA experiment `SRX885420` (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX885420) using the engine `blastn`. Detailed workflow is described as follows.\n\n#### Retrieve the sequence of a homologous gene from a well-studied species\n\nDownload nucleotide/protein sequences of *Aedes aegypti S6K* from [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/), [Ensembl](https://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) or other online databases, and let’s say it was saved as the file `/home/user/r2g_orkspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta`. *Aedes aegypti* is a well-studied mosquito species.\n\n![lure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangwu91/r2g/master/images/20191024163424.png)\n\n#### Select a public SRA database for the species to be investigated\n\nSelect a proper SRA experiment for *Aedes albopictus* (e.g. `SRX885420`). Some genes only express in specific tissues or at specific time. Make sure the gene you are interested in indeed expresses in the SRA experiment(s) you selected.\n\n![fishing spot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangwu91/r2g/master/images/20191024155211.png)\n\n#### Run the r2g pipeline\n\nRun the r2g pipeline. Here, we chopped the query (`/home/user/r2g_workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta`) into 80-base fragments overlapping 50 bases. The command line is as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /home/user/r2g_workspace:/workspace -u $UID yangwu91/r2g:latest -o /workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn -s SRX885420 -q /workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta --cut 80,50 -p blastn\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```bash\nr2g -o /home/user/r2g_workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn -s SRX885420 -q /home/user/r2g_workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta --cut 80,50 -p blastn\n```\n\n#### Review the result\n\nThe sequence file in FASTA format of the predicted *Aedes albopictus S6K* is in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn/`. Please verify the sequences by the PCR amplification or other methods if necessary.\n\n\n",
