    "description": "# FamPlex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sorgerlab/famplex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sorgerlab/famplex)\n\n*FamPlex* is a collection of resources for grounding protein families and complexes\nfrom text and describing their hierarchical relationships. Resources were\ndeveloped by manual curation for use by natural language processing and\nbiological modeling teams in the [DARPA Big\nMechanism](http://www.darpa.mil/program/big-mechanism) and [Communicating with\nComputers](http://www.darpa.mil/program/communicating-with-computers) programs.\n\nThe open access publication describing FamPlex is available here:\n\n* John A. Bachman, Benjamin M. Gyori and Peter K. Sorger, [FamPlex: a resource\nfor entity recognition and relationship resolution of human protein families\nand complexes in biomedical text mining](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2211-5). (2018) BMC Bioinformatics 19(1):248\n\n\nNote: FamPlex used to be called Bioentities, and was renamed to better reflect\nthe focus of the resource on protein families, complexes, and their lexical\nsynonyms.\n\nThe repository contains the following files:\n\n* ```relations.csv```. Defines membership of specific genes/proteins in\n  families and protein complexes. For example, ```PIK3CA isa PI3K_p110```,\n  where PI3K_p110 represents the class of catalytic subunits of PI3K; and\n  ```PI3K_p110 partof PI3K```, where PI3K represents a named complex consisting\n  of a catalytic and regulatory subunit.\n\n* ```equivalences.csv```. Defines mappings between outside namespaces and\nthe FamPlex namespace.\n\n* ```entities.csv```. A registry of the families and complexes defined in the\n  FamPlex namespace.\n\n* ```descriptions.csv```. Descriptions and citations of some entities. Contains\n  three columns: the FamPlex name, pipe separated reference CURIEs, and a \n  textual description.\n\n* ```grounding_map.csv```. Explicit mapping of text strings to identifiers in\n  biological databases.\n\n* ```gene_prefixes.csv```. Patterns of prefixes and suffixes on named entities.\n\n* ```check_references.py```. A script to check the integrity and completeness\n  of the cross-references among the various files.\n\n\n## Entities, Relations and Equivalences\n\n*FamPlex* contains resources for defining the relationships between\ngenes/proteins and their membership in families and named complexes. Entities\ndefined within the FamPlex namespace are listed in the ```entities.csv```\nfile. Cross-referencing the entries among the various files maintains\nconsistency and prevents errors.\n\nRelationships are defined in ```relations.csv``` as a triples using two\nrelationships:\n\n* ```isa```, denoting membership in a family;\n\n* ```partof```, denoting membership in a protein complex.\n\nThese two relationships can be combined to capture complex hierarchical\nrelationships, including sub-families (families within families) and complexes\nconsisting of families of related subunits (e.g., PI3K, NF-kB).\n\nThe ```relations.csv``` file consists of five columns: (1) the namespace for\nthe subject (e.g., ```HGNC``` for gene names, ```UP``` for Uniprot, or\n```FPLX``` for the FamPlex namespace), (2) the identifier for the subject,\n(3) the relationship (```isa``` or ```partof```), (4) the namespace for the\nobject, and (5) the identifier for the object.\n\nThe ```equivalences.csv``` file consists of three columns (1) the namespace of\nan outsite entity (e.g. ```BEL```, ```PFAM```),\n(2) the identifier of the outside entity in the namespace given in the\nfirst column, and (3) the equivalent entity in the ```FPLX``` namespace.\n\n## Grounding Map\n\nUsing mechanisms extracted from text mining to explain biological datasets\nrequires that the entities in text are correctly grounded to the canonical\nnames and IDs of genes, proteins, and chemicals. The problem is that simple\nlookups based on string matching often fail, particularly for protein families\nand named complexes, which appear frequently in text but lack corresponding\nentries in databases.\n\nThe grounding map addresses this by providing explicit grounding for frequently\nencountered entities in the biological literature. The text strings were drawn\nfrom a corpus of roughly 32,000 papers focused on growth factor signaling in\ncancer.\n\nEntities are grounded to the following databases:\n\n* Genes/proteins: [Uniprot](http://www.uniprot.org)\n\n* Chemicals: [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),\n  [CHEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/), and [HMDB](http://www.hmdb.ca/) (for\n  metabolites)\n\n* Biological processes: [GO](http://geneontology.org/) and\n  [MeSH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh)\n\n* Protein families and named complexes: grounded to entities defined within\n  the FamPlex repository in the ```entities.csv``` and ```relations.csv```\n  files, and to identifiers in [PFAM](http://pfam.xfam.org/)\n  and [Interpro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) when possible.\n\n## Gene prefixes\n\nThe file ```gene_prefixes.csv``` enumerates prefixes and suffixes frequently\nappended to named entities. Some of these represent subtleties of experimental\ncontext (for example, that a protein of interest was tagged with a fluorescent\nprotein in an experiment) that can safely be ignored when determining the logic\nof a sentence. However, others carry essential meaning: for example, a sentence\ndescribing the effect of 'AKT shRNA' on a downstream target has the opposite\nmeaning of a sentence involving 'AKT', because 'AKT shRNA' represents\ninhibition of AKT by genetic silencing.\n\nThe patterns included in this file were found by manually reviewing 70,000\nnamed entities extracted by the REACH parser from a corpus of roughly 32,000\npapers focused on growth factor signaling.\n\n**Important note: the prefixes/suffixes may be applied additively, for example\n```Myr-Flag-Akt1```, indicating myristoylated, FLAG-tagged AKT1; or\n```GFP-KRAS-G12V```, indicating GFP-tagged KRAS with a G12V mutation.**\n\nThe file contains three columns:\n\n1. A case-sensitive pattern, e.g., ```mEGFP-{Gene name}```, where ```{Gene name}``` represents a protein/gene name.\n2. A category, described below.\n3. Notes: spelling out acronyms, etc.\n\nThe category of the prefix/suffix determines whether it can be stripped off\nwith minimal effect on the meaning, or whether it carries meaning that needs to\nbe incorporated by a parser. The categories are as follows:\n\n* ```experimental context```. Protein tags, gene delivery techniques, etc. **Can\n  generally be ignored.**\n\n* ```species```. Prefixes denoting human, mouse, primate, or mammalian versions\n  of a gene. **In most use cases can be ignored.**\n\n* ```generic descriptor```. Additional words extracted by the entity recognizer\n  that might designate that an entity is a \"protein\", a \"protease\",\n  \"transcription factor\", etc. **In most use cases can be ignored.**\n\n* ```mrna grounding```. In most cases, entities can be grounded to proteins; in\n  the case of ```{Gene name} mRNA```, the entity **must be explicitly grounded\n  as an mRNA.**\n\n* ```protein state```. Designate activation state, post-translational\n  modification, cellular localization, etc. **Must be captured by the\n  parser.**\n\n* ```inhibition```. Designate protein forms or interventions that represent an\n  inhibition of the protein, that is, a loss-of-function experiment.  Have the\n  effect of switching the polarity of the extracted mechanism. For example, the\n  sentence \"DUSP6 silencing leads to MAPK1 phosphorylation\" indicates that DUSP6\n  **inhibits** MAPK1 phosphorylation. **Must be captured by the parser.**\n\n## Python Package\n\nFamPlex is available as a Python package on PyPi and can be installed with\nthe command\n\n    $ pip install famplex\n\nThe package provides utilities for loading resource files and working with the\ngraph of FamPlex relations. If the famplex repository has been cloned instead of\npip installed, resource files will not be directly available to the package.\nRunning the command\n\n    $ python update_resources.py\n\nat the top level of the repo will copy the files to where they are needed. This\nshould be run anytime the user has made changes to the top level resource files\nthat they would like to be available in the package.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests via the main\nsorgerlab/famplex repository: https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex\n\nIf making additions or revisions to the CSV files\ntake care to handle quotations and newlines correctly. This allows diffs to be\nhandled correctly so changes can be reviewed. Please submit updates via pull\nrequests on Github.\n\nThe CSV files in the FamPlex repo are set up to be edited natively using\nMicrosoft Excel. The CSV files in the repo have Windows line terminators\n('\\r\\n'), and are not ragged (i.e., missing entries in a row are padded out\nwith empty strings to reach the full width of the longest row).\n\nTo preserve correct newlines, take the following steps:\n\n1. If saving from Excel (Windows or Mac OS X), save to the \"Windows Comma\n   Separated (.csv)\" format.\n\n2. If reading (or writing) the files using a Python script, use the following\n   set of csv format parameters::\n\n    csvreader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"',\n                           quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL, lineterminator='\\r\\n')\n\n3. If editing the files on Linux, post-process files using ```unix2dos``` or a\n   similar program.\n\nWhen you're done, run `tox` to verify the integrity of the updates you've\nmade and to generate new exports.\n\n\n",
