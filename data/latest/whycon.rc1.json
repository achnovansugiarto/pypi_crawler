It is fully open-source.\n_WhyCon-orig_ is WhyCon's original, minimalistic version that was supposed to be ROS and openCV independent.\n\n\n### <a name=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</a>\n\n* <b>OpenCV</b>\n* <b>Whycon Core library</b> - see bellow\n* <b>pkconfig</b> - only for module building\n* <b>pybind11</b> - only for module building\n* <b>numpy</b>\n\n### <a name=\"install\">Install</a>\n\nYou have to install the package from your **active python environment**.\n\nDepending on your environment, you may need to enter something like\n\n`conda activate _your_python_environment_name_` \n\nor \n\n`workon _your_python_environment_name_`.\n\n\n#### Makefile\n\nCompile and linking module to **./bin/whycon.so**.\n\n(It also compiles the _Whycon Core library_.)\n\n    make\n\n#### setup.py\n\n    ./setup.py install\n\n(It calls the make [see above] and installs the whycon package in the current python environment.)\n\n\n#### Pip\n\n    pip install whycon\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples are in the _usecases_ directory in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ivomarvan/pywhycon\">repo on GitHub</a>.\n\n#### show_help.py\n\nIt only tests that the module was installed successfully.

It is fully open-source.\n_WhyCon-orig_ is WhyCon's original, minimalistic version that was supposed to be ROS and openCV independent.\n\n\nThe _WhyCon_ system was developed as a joint project between the University of Buenos Aires, Czech Technical University and University of Lincoln, UK.\nThe main contributors were [Matias Nitsche](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z0hQoRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Jan Faigl](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-finD_sAAAAJ&hl=en). Each of these contributors maintains a slightly different version of WhyCon.\n\n## History of the repo\n\nThere are many implementations of this idea on GitHub. Because they come from the scientific environment, they are at different stages of development and with different modifications.\nThe goal of this implementation is to enable the development of the core of this idea as an independent library that can be used by other projects.\n\nThe basis for this library is the implementation from https://github.com/jiriUlr/whycon-ros.\n\nThere is a fully functional reproduction of individual marks in the image, as well as their identification (WhyCode).\n\n## Other significant implementations\n| WhyCon version  | Application | Main features | Maintainer|\n| --------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- |\n| [WhyCon-orig](../../) | general | 2D, 3D, ROS, lightweight, autocalibration | [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)|\n| [WhyCon-ROS](https://github.com/lrse/whycon) | general | 2D, ROS | [Matias Nitsche](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z0hQoRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) |\n| [SwarmCon](https://github.com/gestom/CosPhi/tree/master/Localization) | μ-swarms | 2D, individual IDs, autocalibration | [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) |\n| [Caspa-WhyCon](http://robotics.fel.cvut.cz/faigl/caspa/) | UAVs | embedded, open HW-SW solution | [Jan Faigl](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-finD_sAAAAJ&hl=en) |\n| [Social-card](https://github.com/strands-project/strands_social/tree/hydro-devel/social_card_reader) | HRI | ROS, allows to command a robot | [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) |\n\n#### Where is it described ?\n\n<i>WhyCon</i> was first presented on International Conference on Advanced Robotics 2013 [[2](#references)], later in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotics Systems [[1](#references)] and finally at the Workshop on Open Source Aerial Robotics during the International Conference on Intelligent Robotic Systems, 2015 [[3](#references)]. Its early version was also presented at the International Conference of Robotics and Automation, 2013 [[4](#references)]. An extension of the system, which used a necklace code to add ID's to the tags, achieved a best paper award at the SAC 2017 conference [[5](#references)].\nIf you decide to use this software for your research, please cite <i>WhyCon</i> using the one of the references provided in this [bibtex](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/gestom/CosPhi/papers/WhyCon.bib) file.\n\n-----\n\n### <a name=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</a>\n\n* <b>opencv</b>\n\n### <a name=\"build\">How to build and install</a>\n####In general\nTo see a current variable setting of Makefile you can call \n`make info`\n\nIf you want to set a parameter, you can do it as follows\n`make info USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1`\n(make USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1)\n\n####OpenCv and other (Python for example)\nUnfortunately, the current implementation is dependent on OpenCV. \nIf you expect to use the library with another application/library (such as Python), \nyou need to use the **same version of the OpenCV** library.\n\nIf the variable USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON = 1 (default is 0) \nthe makefile tries to find OpenCV, which is in the appropriate version of Python.\n\nIf you use a **virtual** Python **environment**, you must **activate** it during the compilation.\n\n(For example \n`conda activate <your enviroment>`\nor `source venv/bin/activate`\n, ...)\n\n####Compilation and linking\n\n`make`\n\nor (for Python, inside of Python enviroment ) \n\n`make USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1` \n\n\n#### <a name=\"install\">Install</a>\n`sudo make install`\n\n\n#### <a name=\"uninstall\">Uninstall</a>\n`sudo make uninstall`\n\n### <a name=\"usecases\">Projects that produce this library</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/ivomarvan/pywhycon\">Python wrapper for whycon (vision-based localization system)</a>\n\n### <a name=\"todo\">To Do List</a>\n* Transfer hidden parameters from code to configurations.\n* Add tests.  \n* Remove the dependency on opencv (used mainly for coordinate transformation).\n\n### References\n\n1.
