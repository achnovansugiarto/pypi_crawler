    "description": "Matrix Angular SDK \n==================\n\n.. DANGER::\n   **matrix-angular-sdk is not currently being maintained or developed by the core\n   team, and whilst stable it has some serious performance issues; Angular makes it\n   a bit too easy to shoot yourself in the foot and doesn't help you escape when\n   you do so.  All of our current focus is going into the\n   https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk\n   and https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-skin stack instead - please use\n   those rather than this if you want support from the core team.  Thanks!**\n\n.. image:: http://matrix.org/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=SynapseWebClient\n   :target: http://matrix.org/jenkins/job/SynapseWebClient/\n\nThis project provides AngularJS services for implementing the `Client-Server API`_\non Matrix_ : an open standard for interoperable Instant Messaging and VoIP. It \ncomes shipped with Synapse_ : a home server reference implementation.\n\nThis project also provides a complete, stand-alone client which can communicate \nwith Matrix home servers using a web browser.\n\nThe Synapse_ homeserver ships the latest stable version of this library.  If you\nwish it to serve up a development copy instead, then you must configure this\ncheckout to be picked up by synapse::\n\n    $ python setup.py develop --user\n\nRunning\n=======\nTo run the stand-alone client, the ``syweb/webclient`` folder must be hosted.\nThis can most easily be achieved by::\n\n   cd syweb/webclient\n   python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n   \nNavigate to ``http://localhost:8000`` to see the client.\n\nBugs / Feature Requests\n=======================\nThink you've found a bug? Want a new feature on the client? Please open an issue\non JIRA:\n\n- Create an account and login to https://matrix.org/jira\n- Navigate to the ``SYWEB`` project.\n- Click **Create Issue** - Please be as descriptive as possible, with reproduction\n  steps if possible.\n\nAll issues in JIRA are **public**.\n\nContributing\n============\nWant to fix a bug or add a new feature? Check JIRA first to see if someone else is\nhandling this issue. If no one is actively working on the issue, then please fork\nthe ``develop`` branch when writing your fix, and open a pull request when you're\nready. Do not base your pull requests off ``master``.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\nThe web client can be configured by adding a ``config.js`` file in the \n``syweb/webclient`` directory. This includes configuration for setting up ReCaptcha.\nAn example file can be found at ``syweb/webclient/config.sample.js``.\n\nStructure\n=========\nThe ``app`` directory contains the SDK, which is split up into subfolders depending\non the logical scope of the code. The ``components`` directory contains reusable\ncomponents which are used in many places. More specific directories such as ``home``\nand ``settings`` contain code specific to that part of the app: e.g. the home screen\nand settings page respectively.\n\nThe `Client-Server API`_ is encapsulated as an AngularJS service called ``matrixService``.\nThere are also complementary services such as ``eventStreamService`` which handle more\ncomplex non-HTTP client logic.\n\nServices can be used independently provided their dependencies are satisfied. \n\n* ``matrixService`` is provided at the lowest level, as it just wraps the raw HTTP calls.\n* ``modelService`` allows models of matrix objects to be accessed, such as ``User``, \n  ``Room``, ``RoomState`` and ``RoomMember``, and provides convenience functions to perform\n  HTTP calls on these objects (e.g. ``Room.leave``).\n* ``eventHandlerService`` interprets raw Matrix events and determines what needs to be\n  stored with the ``modelService``.\n* ``eventStreamService`` controls long-polling behaviour on the ``/events`` HTTP call.\n* ``typingService`` controls the submission of typing events into a room.\n* ``presenceService`` controls the submission of presence events.\n \nAlternatively, you can use different controllers and html templates and leave the services\nto work together as is.\n\nTests\n=====\nTests are contained in the `test directory`_. They require\nKarma (running PhantomJS) and Jasmine 2.x+ in order to run. Assuming you have the \nrequired karma plugins, you can run the tests by running ``karma start`` in the \ntest directory.\n\nAttributions\n============\nFile icons are taken from http://medialoot.com/item/free-flat-filetype-icons/ and\ndistributed under the terms of the Paid License (invoice #7355)\n\nKeyboard and GIF icon from icons8: http://icons8.com/\n\n.. _Synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/\n.. _Matrix: http://www.matrix.org\n.. _Client-Server API: http://matrix.org/docs/api/client-server/\n.. _test directory: syweb/webclient/test",
