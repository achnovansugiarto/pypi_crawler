    "description": "pySUT\n=====\n\nPython class for efficient handling of supply and use tables (SUTs)\n\nCreated on Mon Jun 30 17:21:28 2014\n\n@author: stefan pauliuk and Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, NTNU Trondheim, Norway <br>\nwith contributions from <br>\nKonstantin Stadler, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway<br>\nChris Mutel, PSI, Villingen, CH <br>\n\n<b>Dependencies:</b> <br>\nnumpy >= 1.9<br>\nscipy >= 0.14<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Tutorial:</b><br>\nhttps://github.com/cmutel/pySUT/blob/master/Doc/pySUT_Documentation.ipynb <br>\n<b>Documenation of all methods and functions:</b><br>\nhttp://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/stefanpauliuk/pySUT/blob/master/Doc/pysut.html\n<br>\n\n<b> Below, a quick installation guide and a link to the tutorial are provided:</b><br><br>\n\n<b>a) Installation as package:</b> <br>\nPull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\\MyPythonPackages\\'). Then open a console, change to the directory ../pySUT-master/, and install the package from the command line: <br>\n> python setup.py install \n\nThis makes the package available to Python. At any other place in a system with the same python installation, pydsm is now ready to be imported simply by <br>\n> import pysut\n\nThis setup also allows us to run the unit test: <br>\n\n> import unittest\n\n> import pysut\n\n> import pysut.tests\n\n> unittest.main(pysut.tests, verbosity=2)\n\nOr, to run a specific test\n\n> unittest.main(pydsm.tests.test_allocations_constructs, verbosity=2)\n\n<br>\n<b>b) Manual installation, by modifying the python path</b><br>\nPull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\\MyPythonPackages\\'). Then include in your code the following lines <br>\n> import sys \n\n> sys.path.append('C:\\\\MyPythonPackages\\\\pySUT-master\\\\pydsm\\\\') \n\n> from pysut import SupplyUseTable",
