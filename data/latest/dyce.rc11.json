Computing finite discrete probability distributions for:\n    * ***Game designers*** who want to understand or experiment with various dice mechanics and interactions; and\n    * ***Design tool developers***.\n1. Generating transparent, weighted random rolls for:\n    * ***Game environment developers*** who want flexible dice mechanic resolution in, e.g., virtual tabletops (VTTs), chat servers, etc.\n\nBeyond those audiences, ``dyce`` may be useful to anyone interested in exploring finite discrete probabilities but not in developing all the low-level math bits from scratch.\n\n``dyce`` is designed to be immediately and broadly useful with minimal additional investment beyond basic knowledge of Python.\nWhile not as compact as a dedicated grammar, ``dyce``’s Python-based primitives are quite sufficient, and often more expressive.\nThose familiar with various [game notations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) should be able to adapt quickly.\nIf you’re looking at something on which to build your own grammar or interface, ``dyce`` can serve you well.\n\n``dyce`` should be able to replicate or replace most other dice probability modeling tools.\nIt strives to be [fully documented](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/) and relies heavily on examples to develop understanding.\n\n``dyce`` is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\nSee the accompanying ``LICENSE`` file for details.\nNon-experimental features should be considered stable (but an unquenchable thirst to increase performance remains).\nSee the [release notes](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/notes/) for a summary of version-to-version changes.\nSource code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/posita/dyce).\n\nIf you find it lacking in any way, please don’t hesitate to [bring it to my attention](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/contrib/).\n\n## Donors\n\nWhen one worries that the flickering light of humanity may be snuffed out at any moment, when one’s heart breaks at the perverse celebration of judgment, vengeance, and death and the demonizing of empathy, compassion, and love, sometimes all that is needed is the kindness of a single stranger to reinvigorate one’s faith that—while all may not be right in the world—there is hope for us human beings.\n\n* [David Eyk](https://eykd.net/about/) not only [inspires others to explore creative writing](https://eykd.net/blog/), but has graciously ceded his PyPI project dedicated to [his own prior work under a similar name](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dyce/).\n  As such, ``dyce`` is now [available as ~~``dycelib``~~ _``dyce``_](https://pypi.org/project/dyce/)!\n  Thanks to his generosity, ~~millions~~ *dozens* of future ``dyce`` users will be spared from typing superfluous characters.\n  On behalf of myself, those souls, and our keyboards, we salute you, Mr. Eyk. 🙇‍♂️\n\n## A taste\n\n``dyce`` provides several core primitives.\n[``H`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H) represent histograms for modeling finite discrete outcomes, like individual dice.\n[``P`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.p.P) represent pools (ordered sequences) of histograms.\n[``R`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce.r/#dyce.r.R) (covered [elsewhere](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/rollin/)) represent nodes in arbitrary roller trees useful for translating from proprietary grammars and generating weighted random rolls that “show their work” without the overhead of enumeration.\nAll support a variety of operations.\n\n``` python\n>>> from dyce import H\n>>> d6 = H(6)  # a standard six-sided die\n>>> 2@d6 * 3 - 4  # 2d6 × 3 - 4\nH({2: 1, 5: 2, 8: 3, 11: 4, 14: 5, 17: 6, 20: 5, 23: 4, 26: 3, 29: 2, 32: 1})\n>>> d6.lt(d6)  # how often a first six-sided die shows a face less than a second\nH({False: 21, True: 15})\n>>> abs(d6 - d6)  # subtract the least of two six-sided dice from the greatest\nH({0: 6, 1: 10, 2: 8, 3: 6, 4: 4, 5: 2})\n\n```\n\n``` python\n>>> from dyce import P\n>>> p_2d6 = 2@P(d6)  # a pool of two six-sided dice\n>>> p_2d6.h()  # pools can be collapsed into histograms\nH({2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 5, 7: 6, 8: 5, 9: 4, 10: 3, 11: 2, 12: 1})\n>>> p_2d6 == 2@d6  # pools and histograms are comparable\nTrue\n\n```\n\nBy providing an optional argument to the [``P.h`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.p.P.h), one can “take” individual dice from pools, ordered least to greatest.\n(The [``H.format`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.format) provides rudimentary visualization for convenience.)\n\n``` python\n>>> p_2d6.h(0)  # take the lowest die of 2d6\nH({1: 11, 2: 9, 3: 7, 4: 5, 5: 3, 6: 1})\n>>> print(p_2d6.h(0).format())\navg |    2.53\nstd |    1.40\nvar |    1.97\n  1 |  30.56% |###############\n  2 |  25.00% |############\n  3 |  19.44% |#########\n  4 |  13.89% |######\n  5 |   8.33% |####\n  6 |   2.78% |#\n\n```\n\n``` python\n>>> p_2d6.h(-1)  # take the highest die of 2d6\nH({1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 7, 5: 9, 6: 11})\n>>> print(p_2d6.h(-1).format())\navg |    4.47\nstd |    1.40\nvar |    1.97\n  1 |   2.78% |#\n  2 |   8.33% |####\n  3 |  13.89% |######\n  4 |  19.44% |#########\n  5 |  25.00% |############\n  6 |  30.56% |###############\n\n```\n\n[``H`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H) provide a [``distribution`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution) and a [``distribution_xy`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution_xy) to ease integration with plotting packages\n[``anydyce``](https://github.com/posita/anydyce/), for example, makes use of these to integrate with [``matplotlib``](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html).\n\n<!-- Should match any title of the corresponding plot title -->\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posita/dyce/v0.6.0/docs/assets/plot_2d6_lo_hi_dark.png\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\">\n  <img alt=\"Plot: Taking the lowest or highest die of 2d6\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posita/dyce/v0.6.0/docs/assets/plot_2d6_lo_hi_light.png#gh-light-mode-only\"><span style=\"display: none\"><img alt=\"Plot: Taking the lowest or highest die of 2d6\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posita/dyce/v0.6.0/docs/assets/plot_2d6_lo_hi_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only\"></span>\n</picture>\n<!-- The above is a ridiculous work-around for GitHub's braindead, proprietary\nlight/dark image rendering dumpster fire.

[rolling](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/rollin/), as well as the [API guide](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/) for much more thorough treatments, including detailed examples.\n\n## Design philosophy\n\n``dyce`` is fairly low-level by design, prioritizing ergonomics and composability.\nIt explicitly avoids stochastic simulation, but instead determines outcomes through enumeration and discrete computation.\nThat’s a highfalutin way of saying it doesn’t guess.\nIt *knows*, even if knowing is harder or more limiting.\nWhich, if we possess a modicum of humility, it often is.\n\n!!! quote\n\n    “It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what is going on.”\n\n    —Amos Tversky\n\nBecause ``dyce`` exposes Python primitives rather than defining a dedicated grammar and interpreter, one can more easily integrate it with other tools.[^1]\nIt can be installed and run anywhere[^2], and modified as desired.\nOn its own, ``dyce`` is completely adequate for casual tinkering.\nHowever, it really shines when used in larger contexts such as with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or embedded in a special-purpose application.\n\n[^1]:\n\n    You won’t find any lexers, parsers, or tokenizers in ``dyce``’s core, other than straight-up Python.\n    That being said, you can always “roll” your own (see what we did there?) and lean on ``dyce`` underneath.\n    It doesn’t mind.\n    It actually [kind of *likes* it](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/rollin/).\n\n[^2]:\n\n    Okay, maybe not _literally_ anywhere, but [you’d be surprised](https://jokejet.com/guys-i-need-a-network-specialist-with-some-python-experience-its-urgent/).\n    Void where prohibited.\n    [Certain restrictions](#requirements) apply.\n    [Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball](https://youtu.be/GmqeZl8OI2M).\n\nIn an intentional departure from [RFC 1925, § 2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925#section-2), ``dyce`` includes some conveniences, such as minor computation optimizations (e.g., the [``H.lowest_terms`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.lowest_terms), various other shorthands, etc.) and formatting conveniences (e.g., the [``H.distribution``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution), [``H.distribution_xy``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution_xy), and [``H.format``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/dyce/#dyce.h.H.format) methods).\n\n## Comparison to alternatives\n\nThe following is a best-effort[^3] summary of the differences between various available tools in this space.\nConsider exploring the [applications and translations](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/translations/) for added color.\n\n[^3]:\n\n    I have attempted to ensure the above is reasonably accurate, but please consider [contributing an

Requirements\n\n``dyce`` requires a relatively modern version of Python:\n\n* [CPython](https://www.python.org/) (3.9+)\n* [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) (CPython 3.9+ compatible)\n\nIt has the following runtime dependencies:\n\n* [``numerary``](https://pypi.org/project/numerary/) for ~~proper~~ *best-effort hacking around deficiencies in* static and runtime numeric type-checking\n  [![``numerary``-encumbered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posita/numerary/latest/docs/numerary-encumbered.svg)](https://posita.github.io/numerary/)\n\n* [``beartype``](https://pypi.org/project/beartype/) for yummy runtime type-checking goodness (a dependency of ``numerary``)\n  [![Bear-ified™](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beartype/beartype-assets/main/badge/bear-ified.svg)](https://beartype.rtfd.io/)\n\n``dyce`` will opportunistically use the following, if available at runtime:\n\n* [``numpy``](https://numpy.org/) to supply ``dyce`` with an alternate random number generator implementation\n\nIf you use ``beartype`` for type checking your code, but don’t want ``dyce`` or ``numerary`` to use it internally, disable it with [``numerary``’s ``NUMERARY_BEARTYPE`` environment variable](https://posita.github.io/numerary/latest/#requirements).\n\nSee the [hacking quick-start](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.6/contrib/#hacking-quick-start) for additional development and testing dependencies.\n\n## Customers
