Xbox One.\n2. External Hard drive greater than 256GB.\n3. Python 3.x\n4. Administrator rights.\n\n## Instructions\n\n#### Xbox One to Windows PC\n\n1. Use an Xbox One to correctly configure an external hard drive.\n2. Physically connect the now Xbox One configured external hard drive to a Windows PC.\n2. Run the script with the appropriate paramaters (see xboxoneexternal.py --help, or below). \n4. Power cycle the external hard drive.\n\n#### Windows PC to Xbox One\n\n1. Use a Windows PC to correctly configure a GPT disk with an NTFS partition.\n2. Run the script with the appropriate paramaters (see xboxoneexternal.py --help, or below). \n3. Physically connect the now Xbox One configured external hard drive to a Windows PC.\n\n## Parameters\n\n```\nusage: xboxoneexternal.py [-h] (--toxbox | --topc) drive\n\nXbox One/Series External Drive Converter\n\npositional arguments:\n  drive       The target physical drive\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  --toxbox    Convert the drive from Xbox to PC\n  --topc      Convert the drive from PC to Xbox\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n#### Display current 'Boot Signature' and 'NT Disk Signature'\n\n```\nxboxoneexternal.py \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive5\n\nNT Disk Signature:

Signature of the device 0x99CC (0x1FE-0x1FF) doesn't appear to allow the drive to be seen as initialized in Windows.\n\nSwapping the two Boot Signature bytes with the traditional 0x55AA allows the NTFS partition to be seen be Windows.\n\nOriginal 'Protective MBR':\n```\nOffset(h)   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F\n\n0000000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Windows will offer to initialize an Xbox One formatted disk. Don't do this unless you want to start everything again.\n2. If the Boot Signature matches 0x99CC, the Xbox One will be able to read the partitions. Windows PC will not.\n3. If the Boot Signature matches 0x55AA, a Windows PC will be able to read the partitions. Xbox One will not.\n4. Windows might complain that there is something wrong with the disk and will want to run a chkdsk. I don't reccomend doing this.\n5. Make sure you specify the right disk - don't come to me when it hits the fan.\n\n",
