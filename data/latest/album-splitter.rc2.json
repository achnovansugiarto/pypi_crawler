    "description": "# album-splitter\n\nUse **album-splitter** to automatically split any audio file (youtube videos, albums, podcasts, audiobooks, tapes, vinyls) into separate tracks starting from timestamps. album-splitter will also take care of tagging each part with the correct metadata. If your file is on YouTube, you can download it automatically.\n\nCommon use cases covered:\n\n* music album on YouTube to download and split into tracks\n* full audiobook to split into chapters\n* music tape/cassette rip to split into tracks\n* digitalized vinyl to split into tracks\n\nAll you need is:\n\n* The file to split OR an URL of a YouTube video\n* Timestamps for each track, for example:\n    * `00:06 - When I Was Young`\n    * `03:35 Dogs Eating Dogs`\n\n## How to install\n\nFirst time only:\n\n+ Install `ffmpeg`\n    * Linux: `apt install ffmpeg` (or equivalent)\n    * Windows: [Official website](https://ffmpeg.org/)\n    * MacOS: [Official website](https://ffmpeg.org/) or `brew install ffmpeg`\n+ Install `Python 3` (a version newer or equal to `3.7` is required)\n    * Linux: `apt install python3` (or equivalent)\n    * Windows: [Official webiste](https://www.python.org/)\n    * MacOS: You should have it already installed\n+ Open your terminal app\n+ Create a virtual environment\n    * `python3 -m venv venv`\n+ Activate the virtual environment\n  * Linux/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`\n  * Windows: `./venv/Scripts/activate`\n+ Install album-splitter\n    * `python3 -m pip install album-splitter`\n+ You are ready to go!\n\nAfter the first time:\n\n+ Open your terminal app\n+ Optional, update album-splitter:\n    * `python3 -m pip install --upgrade album-splitter`\n+ Activate the virtual environment\n  * Linux/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`\n  * Windows: `./venv/Scripts/activate`\n+ You are ready to go!\n\n## Quick guide (from a local album)\n\n+ Create a copy of the `tracks.txt.example`, rename it as `tracks.txt`\n+ Open `tracks.txt`\n+ Add your tracks timestamps info in this format:\n    * `<start-time> - <title>`\n    * A track on each line\n    * See *Examples* section, many other formats supported\n+ Run the script\n    * Basic usage: `python -m album_splitter --file <path/to/your/album.mp3>`\n    * More in the *Examples* section\n+ Wait for the splitting process to complete\n+ You will find your tracks in the `./splits/` folder\n\n## Quick guide (from a YouTube video)\n\n+ Copy the YouTube URL of the album you want to download and split\n+ Find in the YouTube comments the tracklist with start-time and title\n+ Create a copy of the `tracks.txt.example`, rename it as `tracks.txt`\n+ Open `tracks.txt`\n+ Copy the tracklist in the file, adjusting for the supported formats\n    * `<start-time> - <title>`\n    * A track on each line\n+ Run the script\n    * Basic usage: `python -m album_splitter -yt <youtube_url>`\n    * More in the *Examples* section\n+ Wait for the Download and for the conversion\n+ Wait for the splitting process to complete\n+ You will find your tracks in the `./splits` folder\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe format of the output tracks is the same as the format of the input (same extension, same codec, same bitrate, ...), it simply does a copy of the codec. If you want to convert the output tracks to a different format, you can do this using additional tools.\n\nFor example to convert from `.wav` to `.mp3` you can use FFmpeg. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41207442) is how you can do it on Linux/macOS. [This](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-batch/) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56244203) might help for Windows instead. You can adopt such snippets to do other processing, such as changing the bitrate.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Downloading and splitting an album from YouTube\n\n+ This is the album I want to download and split: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uqD4ng9hw`\n+ I find the tracklist in the comments and I copy that in `tracks.txt`, eventually adjusting it to a supported format for the tracklist\n+\n```\n00:06 - When I Was Young\n...\n14:48 - Pretty Little Girl\n```\n\n+ I execute `python -m album_splitter -yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uqD4ng9hw\"` and wait\n+ Once the process is complete I open the `./splits` and I find all my songs:\n```\n    When I Was Young.mp3\n    ...\n    Pretty Little Girl.mp3\n```\nThese songs are already mp3-tagged with their track name and track number, but not their author or their album, since we have not specified it.\n\n### Splitting and tagging with Author and Album a local file\n\n+ I somehow got the file `DogsEatingDogsAlbum.mp3` that I want to split\n+ I set the tracklist in `tracks.txt` (same tracks as before)\n+ I execute `python -m album_splitter --file DogsEatingDogsAlbum.mp3 --album \"Dogs Eating Gods\" --artist \"blink-182\" --folder \"2012 - Dogs Eating Dogs\"`\n+ The software will execute, it will split the album, and mp3-tag each track with the author and the album name I passed as a parameter (as well as track number and name). It will also put the files in the folder passed as an argument (instead of putting them in the default `./splits` folder)\n\n## Supported formats for the track list (`tracks.txt`)\n\nThese are just some examples, find more in `tracks.txt.example`.\n\n* `[hh:]mm:ss - Title`\n* `Title - [hh:]mm:ss`\n* `Title [hh:]mm:ss`\n\nTo just see which data would be extracted from the tracklist use the option `--dry-run`.\n\n## Available Options\n\nTo get the full help and all the available options run `python -m album_splitter --help`\n\n## Need help?\n\nIf you need any help just [create an Issue](https://github.com/crisbal/album-splitter/issues) or send me an email at the address you can find on my profile.\n\n## Updating\n\nTo update to use the latest version of album-splitter you can use `python3 -m pip install --upgrade album-splitter`\n\n## Want to help?\n\nIf you want to improve the code and submit a pull request, please feel free to do so.\n\n## License\n\nGPL v3\n",
