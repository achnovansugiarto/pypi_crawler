The app is specifically tailored for comprehensive examination of result files from isobaric labeling-based quantitative experiments.\n\n*protexam* has been tested on Python 3.8 on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04. The package is dependent on multiple packages, such as *streamlit*, *bokeh*, *matplotlib*. Because of that, we strongly advise creating a virtual environment. One option is [*venv*](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments), which is a part of Python's standard library.\\\nFirst, we need to choose a path and create a virtual environment there. On Linux, create the environment using the command line, with your custom path and project name:\n\n\n```\npython3 -m venv /your_project_path/project_name\n```\n\nNow we can activate the newly created environment:\n\n```\nsource /your_project_path/project_name/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf the environment has been activated correctly, the name of the environment should be displayed in the console.\n\n```\n(project_name) user:~$\n```\n\nIt is a good idea to update pip within the virtual environment before installing other packages:\n\n```\npip3 install --upgrade pip\n```\n\nWe can now install *protexam*. The installation will take a while due to the long list of dependencies.\n\n```\npip3 install protexam\n```\n\nThe dashboard is based on *streamlit*, so we will need to run the script *app.py* in order to deploy the dashboard. The module will help us to find the path to the *app.py* file. Run the module as follows:\n\n```\npython3 -m protexam\n```\n\nThe output in the console will contain a few notes, including the path to the source file. Change the working directory using the suggested path:\n\n```\ncd /path_to_app_source\n```\n\nFinally, run the app:\n\n```\nstreamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize 1000 --server.port 8501\n```\n\nwhere:\n    server.maxUploadSize - max size of a single text file in MB\n    server.port - port for the app\n\nWe would need to modify the above-mentioned commands if we are using a Windows machine:\n\n```\n>python -m venv /your_project_path/project_name\n>your_project_path/project_name/Scripts/activate\n>pip install --upgrade pip\n>pip install protexam\n>python -m protexam\n>cd path_to_app_source\n>streamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize 1000 --server.port 8501\n```\n\nRight after launching the app, *streamlit* will give us a hint on how to access the dashboard in a web browser. To view locally, go to:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8501\n```\n\nUse the IP address to view the dashboard in the local network:\n```\nhttp://ip-of-the-server:8501\n```\nThe dashboard has been specifically adapted for the [Proteome Discoverer (PD)](https://www.thermofisher.com/se/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteome-discoverer-software.html) tab-delimited output files. However, a few of the MaxQuant tables are also supported. There are two options for creating tab-delimited text output in PD 2.4:\n* add the Result Exporter node to tconsensus workflow. We usually choose \"True\" for the \"R-Friendly header\" option, but the app works with \"False\" as well. The resulting text files can be found in the study folder.\n* if the workflows have been already completed, open the PD result file and go to the menu File -> Export -> To Text (tab delimited).\n\nThe files are uploaded and visualized one-by-one. Choose one of the permitted tables and upload. The app will try to determine the type of the uploaded file and show it below the upload widget. If the type has been inferred correctly, press the \"Generate Plots\" button. If you know the type of the table, but it has not been determined automatically, you can override it manually by selecting from the list, an then pressing the \"Generate Plots\" button.\n\n\n\n",
