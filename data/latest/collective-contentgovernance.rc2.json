    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nThis is an add-on for Plone to provide some content management metadata\nessentials.\n\nEven if they are several fields, they complement each other to build a set of\nuseful features for managing and maintaining websites.\n\nResponsible person\n------------------\n\nIt may come as a surprise to some that we don't have this in Plone already. We\nstore and index the creator of content (a mostly useless value) and we manage an\nowner role on content, a permission rule not indexed for practical use. The\nresponsible person is the person that owns the content and is responsible for\nkeeping it updated.\n\nValidity date\n-------------\n\nThe expiry date field in Plone is not very useful and not often used beyond\ncheckboxes in feature comparisons. This field, the validity date, is more\nuseful: It is always set when saving an object (like the versioning note) from a\nvocabulary of dates in the future (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year\nfrom now). Whenever the object is saved, the date is set in the future.\n\nWhen the date approaches, the responsible person will be notified that his\ncontent is about to expire. It will also be visible in her review lists. For\nupdating it, all she needs to do is to open the content and save it again,\neffectively setting the expiry date some time in the future. If the content does\nexpire, it will, according to site policy, either be archived/made\nunavailable/hidden, or visibly marked as obsolete/unmaintained.\n\nViews and actions needed\n------------------------\n\n* My content\n    a screen of content i am responsible for and its status\n    Perhaps batch operations on it\n    perhaps batch assign to someone else\n\n* New document byline\n    the responsible person, not the creator\n    alternatively a portlet with a photo and contact details of the responsible person\n\n* a new ownership form which sets this field along with the owner role\n\n* a global change ownership form for when you delete/deactivate users.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.1 (2011-12-06)\n----------------\n\n- Prevent the default value to be set during indexing, to prevent breaking\n  ZCatalog internal structures.\n  [mj]\n\n.. important::\n   You'll need to run http://url.to.your/plone-site/@@cleanup-catalog-ghosts\n   to repair a broken ZCatalog after upgrade.\n\n1.0 (2011-08-09)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release\n  [ggozad]",
