    "description": "============\nBuildout Tox\n============\n\nThis is a buildout recipe to build and test packages in multiple\nenvironments. It is inspired by Holger Krekel's excellent Tox__\npackage for virtualenv__ but focuses instead on package development\nusing buildout__.\n\n__ http://codespeak.net/tox\n__ http://www.virtualenv.org/\n__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/1.5.2\n\n.. warning:: \n\n  This package is not currently being developed and was never\n  completed!\n\n  The author discovered that Tox itself can be used with buildout and\n  provides a good way of checking that package distributions contain\n  what is required.\n\n  For an example of this usage pattern, see the TestFixtures__\n  package.\n\n  __ https://github.com/Simplistix/testfixtures",
