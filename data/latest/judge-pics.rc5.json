    "description": "\n# Welcome to the Judge Pics Repository\n\nThis is a collection of judicial portraits that works in tandem with the Free Law Project judicial portraits service. You can use this system to integrate picture of judges directly into your applications.\n\nOriginal files can be found in the `orig` directory.\n\n\n## Using this Project\n\nThis system is exceedingly simple. To use this it, install the judge pics package from pypi:\n\n    pip install judge-pics\n\nAnd then use that package to get the URL of a judge's portrait. You can do that in one of two ways. You can look up the judge by name:\n\n    >>> from judge_pics.search import portrait, ImageSizes\n    >>> portrait(\"Ketanji Jackson\", ImageSizes.SMALL)\n    'https://portraits.free.law/v2/128/jackson-ketanji-1970.jpeg'\n\nOr if you know the CourtListener ID for that judge, that works too (and is more reliable). Ketanji Jackson is ID 1609, so:\n\n    >>> portrait(1609, ImageSizes.SMALL)\n    'https://portraits.free.law/v2/128/jackson-ketanji-1970.jpeg'\n\nYou can request images in one of the following sizes:\n\n```python\nclass ImageSizes(Enum):\n    SMALL = 128\n    MEDIUM = 256\n    LARGE = 512\n    ORIGINAL = \"orig\"\n```\n\nSelecting `ImageSizes.ORIGINAL` will give you a link to the original image that we have in our collection. You'd want to use this to make custom sized images, say.\n\nFinally, if you're debugging or playing around, you can get a feel for a picture by using the `show` function:\n\n![Judge Jackson as ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/freelawproject/judge-pics/blob/main/show-jackson.png)\n\nThat's about it.\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How reliable is the service?\n\nVery. It uses AWS S3 with CloudFront as a CDN. That gives us a LOT of of nines.\n\n### What about versioning? \n\nOver time, we will be adding more photos to these collections. These will arrive as updates to the Python package and as new photos in the service. We expect these to be generally backwards compatible, but if we need to break compatibility, we will do so by bumping the Python package to version 3.x, and changing the URL of the images to contain v3 instead of v2.\n\nWe see no reason why past URLs will ever change.\n\n### So this is a free service? Huh?\n\nHosting this service is cheap, so we're just going to do it. That said, collecting the images for this service and developing it is extremely expensive. Some of this work was supported by Pre/Dicta, but donations help offset our costs.\n\nPlease [donate][d] if this is useful to you.\n\n### How secure is this?\n\nHere's how we're thinking about it.\n\n**1. What prevents the images from being replaced with malicious ones?**\n\nThe short answer is that our incentives are aligned with yours. Because our website uses this same service, it would be difficult for an attacker to put malicious photos on your website without them also appearing on ours. This service is included in our [vulnerability disclosure policy][vdp], and we use process and technical measures to prevent incidents.\n\nIn browsers, there is some discussion of a way to use cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity of hotlinked images, but the feature has not seen much support. ([We're trying to nudge it along.][spec])\n\n\n**2. What private information would we share with Free Law Project by using these services?**\n\nTwo pieces of data are shared with us:\n\n1. The IP address of your users.\n\n2. The URL and/or domain of your website via `referer` headers.\n\nIdeally, we wouldn't get either of these pieces of information, but we at least need the IP so we can serve the request. We do not log it.\n\nFor the referrer, you can avoid sharing it with us by setting the [`Referrer-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) header on your website. You should probably do this anyway.\n\n\n**3. What if Free Law Project is hacked? Could that hack me too?**\n\nThe short answer is \"not really.\" If you're using the `<img>` tag to put judge portraits or court seals on your website, the worst a hacker can do is change those photos. That's not great but the hacker couldn't deliver malicious javascript to your users, couldn't access private information from your website, etc. Hotlinking photos is as old as the Web itself and remains generally secure.\n\n\n## Contributing as a Developer\n\nThis project is fairly easy to contribute to and we need lots of help gathering files. You can see untapped sources for images in the [additional-sources.md][add] file.\n\nThe normal process is:\n\n1. Find an image and ensure it follows our quality guidelines (below).\n\n1. Add the image file to the `orig` directory.\n\n    Pictures are given the name of the judge and are of in the form:\n\n        $last-$first.jpeg\n\n    Noting that:\n\n    - the name is lowercase.\n    - the extension is `jpeg`, not `jpg`.\n    - any punctuation marks in a judge's name should be converted to\n      a dash, according to [Django's slugify function][slugify].\n\n    For example:\n\n        oconnor-sandra.jpeg\n\n    Some judges may have multiple great portraits. For those, omit the date of\n    birth and place a number after their name such as:\n\n        sotomayor-sonia-2.jpeg\n\n    We have also begun collecting group pictures. For these, the pattern is:\n\n        group-$court.jpeg\n\n    Noting that:\n\n    - `$court` corresponds to the CourtListener code for the court.\n      If you are unsure what code to use, you can [easily look it up on\n      CourtListener][codes].\n    - Again, the extension is `jpeg`, not `jpg`.\n\n\n1. Once you have the picture ready, run `python update.py --help` and it'll guide you through the process of updating `people.json`.\n\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n1. Images should be a head and shoulders shot of the judge.\n1. Images must be `jpeg` file format.\n1. Pictures of painted portraits are often skewed and often show the wall where\n   the portrait is hung. Before submitting, de-skew the image and crop out\n   any bits of wall that you can see around the edges.\n\n\n## New Releases\n\nNew releases are fairly seldom. When they happen, the version number is bumped in setup.py, and a new tag matching that version number is added to git. When it's pushed, images are automatically uploaded to S3 and a new release is pushed to PyPi.\n\n\n## A Note to Judges\n\nIf you're a judge looking at this, and you want your picture to be included too, you can contribute it yourself using the guidelines in this readme. We enthusiastically encourage you to do so.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer, you can [send us an email using the contact form on the Free Law Project website][contact], and we'll be happy to do it for you.\n\nEither way, we'd be elated to hear from you.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nTwo things. First, if you are creating original work, please consider signing\nand emailing a contributor license to us so that we may protect the work later,\nif needed.\n\nSecond, if you're just curious about the copyright of this repository, see the\nLicense file for details. The license of individual images is described in\n`people.json`.\n\n\n[add]: https://github.com/freelawproject/judge-pics/blob/master/additional-sources.md\n[slugify]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/_modules/django/utils/text/#slugify\n[contact]: http://free.law/contact/\n[codes]: https://www.courtlistener.com/api/jurisdictions/\n[d]: https://free.law/donate/\n[spec]: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-subresource-integrity/issues/113\n\n\n",
