    "description": "git-sweep\n=========\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/myint/git-sweep.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/myint/git-sweep\n   :alt: Build status\n\nA command-line tool that helps you clean up Git branches that have been merged\ninto master.\n\nThis is a fork that adds Python 3 support (in addition to Python 2). The\noriginal is at https://github.com/arc90/git-sweep.\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nYour ``master`` branch is typically where all your code lands. All features\nbranches are meant to be short-lived and merged into ``master`` once they are\ncompleted.\n\nAs time marches on, you can build up **a long list of branches that are no\nlonger needed**. They've been merged into ``master``, what do we do with them\nnow?\n\nThe answer\n----------\n\nUsing ``git-sweep`` you can **safely remove remote branches that have been\nmerged into master**.\n\nTo install it run::\n\n    $ pip install git-sweep3k\n\nTry it for yourself (safely)\n----------------------------\n\nTo see a list of branches that git-sweep detects are merged into your master\nbranch:\n\nThe ``--dry-run`` option doesn't make any changes to your repository::\n\n    $ git sweep --dry-run\n    Fetching from the remote\n    These branches have been merged into master:\n\n      branch1\n      branch2\n      branch3\n      branch4\n      branch5\n\n    To delete them, run again without --dry-run\n\nIf you are happy with the list, you can run the command that deletes these\nbranches from the remote::\n\n    $ git sweep\n    Fetching from the remote\n    These branches have been merged into master:\n\n      branch1\n      branch2\n      branch3\n      branch4\n      branch5\n\n    Delete these branches? (y/n) y\n      deleting branch1 (done)\n      deleting branch2 (done)\n      deleting branch3 (done)\n      deleting branch4 (done)\n      deleting branch5 (done)\n\n    All done!\n\n    Tell everyone to run `git fetch --prune` to sync with this remote.\n    (you don't have to, yours is synced)\n\n*Note: this can take a little time, it's talking over the tubes to the remote.*\n\nYou can also give it a different name for your remote and master branches::\n\n    $ git sweep --dry-run --master=develop --origin=github\n    ...\n\nTell it to skip the ``git fetch`` that it does by default::\n\n    $ git sweep --dry-run --no-fetch\n    These branches have been merged into master:\n\n      branch1\n\n    To delete them, run again without --dry-run\n\nMake it skip certain branches::\n\n    $ git sweep --dry-run --skip=develop\n    Fetching from the remote\n    These branches have been merged into master:\n\n      important-upgrade\n      upgrade-libs\n\n    To delete them, run again without --dry-run\n\nOnce git-sweep finds the branches, you'll be asked to confirm that you wish to\ndelete them::\n\n    Delete these branches? (y/n)\n\nYou can use the ``--force`` option to bypass this and start deleting\nimmediately::\n\n    $ git sweep --skip=develop --force\n    Fetching from the remote\n    These branches have been merged into master:\n\n      important-upgrade\n      upgrade-libs\n\n      deleting important-upgrade (done)\n      deleting upgrade-libs (done)\n\n    All done!\n\n    Tell everyone to run `git fetch --prune` to sync with this remote.\n    (you don't have to, yours is synced)\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Git >= 1.7\n* Python >= 2.6 or >= 3.2\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nFriendly neighborhood MIT license.",
