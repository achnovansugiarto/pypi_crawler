    "description": "# Optimize Images X [![Github commits (since latest release)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/latest.svg)](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x) ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/optimize-images-x) ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/optimize-images-x)\nA desktop app written in Python, that exposes and unlocks the full power of \n[Optimize Images](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images) in a nice \ngraphical user interface, to help you reduce the file size of images.\n\n![Optimize Images X - Main Window](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/blob/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_main-window.png?raw=true)\n\nOptimize Images X and its CLI companion `optimize-images` offer some useful \nfeatures that are not always present in a single package, like batch downsizing \nof images within a folder (and recursively though its \nsubfolders) based on specified maximum width and/or height.\n\nIf you were just looking for the original (and slightly faster) command-line \nuser interface (CLI) version of this application, it's a separate project: \n[Optimize Images](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images). \n\n## Installation and dependencies:\n\nTo install and run this application, you need to have a working\nPython 3.7+ installation. We try to keep the external dependencies at a minimum, \nin order to keep compatibility with different  environments. At this moment, we \nrequire:\n\n  - optimize-images==1.5.0\n  - Pillow==8.2.0\n  - piexif==1.1.3\n  - watchdog==2.1.2\n\n\nIf you are able to swap Pillow with the faster version \n[Pillow-SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd), you should be able\nto get a considerably faster speed. For that reason, we provide, as a \nfriendly courtesy, an optional shell script (`replace_pillow__macOS.sh`) to \nreplace Pillow with the faster Pillow-SIMD on macOS. Please notice, however, \nthat it usually requires a compilation step, and it was not throughly tested \nby us, so your mileage may vary.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nTo start compressing images, just add one or more files, or a folder. The \nprocess starts as soon as the files are added to the list.\n\nAfter launching the application for the first time, make sure all settings are \nconfigured as desired. The application's default settings are similar to the \nones in Optimize Images. Whenever you change a setting it is applied \nimmediately, and it's saved in the app's database, so that it will be can be \nused again the next time you run the app, without any need to go through all the \nsettings. \n\nIn simple terms, always make sure you have configured Optimize Images X as you \nwant it, but if you just want to use the same settings from last time, just add \nimages.\n\n## Preferences\n\nIf you have used Optimize Images before, you probably already know what options \nare available. If not, please take a few minutes to take a look at the \nPreferences window and its tabs. You will find a description of each option on \nthe original documentation for the command-line based Optimize Images. \n\n### General preferences\n![Optimize Images X - Preferences Window: General](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/raw/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_prefs_general.png)\n\n### JPEG specific preferences\n![Optimize Images X - Preferences Window: General](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/raw/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_prefs_jpeg.png)\n\n### PNG specific preferences\n![Optimize Images X - Preferences Window: General](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/raw/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_prefs_png.png)\n\n\n### More options\n![Optimize Images X - Preferences Window: General](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/raw/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_prefs_more.png)\n\n\n#### User interface options\n\nYou can choose the graphical user interface theme in the `More…` tab of the \nSettings Window. The list of available themes will vary depending on your \noperating system, as well as Python and TK/tcl versions. Just click each one of \nthe radio buttons, and it will be appplied immediately as you click.\n\n\n#### Restoring default settings\n\nOne important feature of Optimize Images X is its opinionated choice of default \napp and task settings, which have been defined with the web in mind and are \nprobably just fine when you just want to apply some compression to the final \nimages to be deployed with you website. So, being able to restore them is also \npossible. You will find the `Reset all settings` button in the `More…` tab of \nthe Settings Window. \n\nRestoring default settings requires that the application is restarted, which is \ndone automatically. So, before resetting, you should make sure you there are no \nmore tasks pending or being processed.\n\nIts worth noting that this process will also reset previous choices regarding \nconfirmation dialog boxes, so they will be shown up again even if you had chosen \nnot to see them.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:  \nPlease note that the operation is done DESTRUCTIVELY, by replacing the\noriginal files with the processed ones. You definitely should duplicate the\nsource file or folder before using this utility, in order to be able to\nrecover any eventual damaged files or any resulting images that don't have the\ndesired quality.**\n\n\n## Did you find a bug or do you have a suggestion?\n\nPlease let me know, by opening a new issue, or a pull request.\n\n\n",
