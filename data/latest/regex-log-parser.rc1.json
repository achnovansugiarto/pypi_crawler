It allows the user to define a dictionary of regex rules and handler functions which determine how logs should be processed. See the examples below for more information.\n\nThis was originally developed at [MWA Telescope](https://mwatelescope.org) in order to perform data mining of a large amount of log data in order to gain useful insights from it. Following the success of the project we have open sourced and published it in the hope that it may be useful for somebody else.\n\nWe built this project to extract data from log files and load it into a PostgreSQL database so that it may be queried. However, it has been developed for extensibility and may be used to ingest into other data stores such as MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and more. \n\nOnly Postgres is supported currently, if you would like to see more data stores supported, see the contributing section below.\n\n## Basic Idea\n\nImagine that you have a directory containing a number of log files. These files may be generated by different systems (i.e. a web server) and different versions of those systems.\n```bash\n/logs\n  web1_1.log\n  web1_2.log\n  web2_1.log\n  web2_2.log\n```\n\nThe log files contain historical information about activity on the system like so:\n```bash\n[2021-11-25 04:29:55,015] INFO, 192.168.0.1 \"POST /login HTTP/1.1\" 200 \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36\"\n[2021-11-25 04:29:56,542] INFO, 192.168.0.1 \"GET /logout HTTP/1.1\" 200 \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36\"\n[2021-11-25 04:30:05,731] INFO, 192.168.0.1 \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36\"\n```\n\nYou want to parse these files to answer questions about the number of logins that have taken place or some other kind of event.\n\nRather than writing code to read each file line by line and doing string splitting, Regex Log Parser allows you to define a set of rules that will be used to parse files within a directory, as well as rules to process lines within matched files.\n\n```python\nrules = {\n    'web1_*': {\n        '[(.*)] INFO, (.*) .*/login.*': 'my_handler',\n        '.*': 'skip'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example rules above, we are defining a dictionary where the key is some regex that will be matched against path/filenames within your directory, and the value is a dictionary which defines how to process the file.\n\nBy using regex capture groups, we can pull out the information we want from each line (datetime and IP address in the example above) and pass them to some handler function (here called my_handler), which can store the information in a database or do something else with it.\n\n### Important Note\nThis library FORCES you to handle all lines in a file. i.e. there must be at least one rule to match a line within a file. If not, an exception will be raised.\n\nThis was done deliberately to ensure that users are handling all cases. Once you're confident that you are handling the lines that you care about, add a catch-all rule to skip everything else:\n\n```python\nrules = {\n    'web1_*': {\n        '.*': 'skip'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n### Prerequisites\n- Python >= 3.10\n\nInstall the package\n```bash\npip install regex_log_parser\n```\n\nIf you wish to use the included functionality for uploading data into a postgres database, install the extra dependencies like so:\n```bash\npip install regex_log_parser[postgres]\n```\n\n## Usage\nCreate a file and import the LogProcessor class. Create an instance of this object then call the run method, passing in a directory containing some logs that you would like to process.\n\nTwo things are required to setup the processor. A rules dictionary and a handler object.\n\n```python\nfrom regex_log_parser import LogProcessor, HandlerBase\n\nlog_processor = LogProcessor(\n    rules=rules,\n    handler=handler,\n    dry_run=False\n)\n\nlog_processor.run('/path/to/my/logs')\n```\n\n### Rules\nRules is a standard python dictionary of the format:\n\n```python\nrules = {\n    \"file_regex\": {\n        \"line_regex\": \"handler_function\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `file_regex` is some regex to match the name of a file,\n- `line_regex` is some regex to match a line within the file,\n- `handler_function` is the name of a function in your handler object which will be used to process the line.\n\n### Handlers\nThe handler object should be subclassed from the HandlerBase class in `handlers.py`. Or, if you wish to parse your logs and upload into a Postgresql database, you can subclass from the `PostgresHandler` class.\n\nThe handler class can implement `startup` and `shutdown` methods. Which will be ran at the start and end of the processing run respectively. These can be used to perform some database setup or cleanup.\n\nhandler_functions will have the signature:\n\n```python\ndef handler(self, file_path, line, match):\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `file_path` is the path to the file of the current line\n- `line` is the line in the log file to be handled\n- `match` is the regex match group\n\nWhen using the `PostgresHandler`, you can call `self.queue_op(sql, params)` in your handler functions to queue a database operation. By default this will run SQL operations in batches of 1000, you can customise this by passing the `BATCH_SIZE` parameter in the constructor to `PostgresHandler`. If you want to run a database operation immediately, call `self.queue_op(sql, params, run_now=True)`.\n\n### Full example\n```python\nfrom Processor import LogProcessor\nfrom handler import PostgresHandler\n\nclass MyHandler(PostgresHandler):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs):\n\n    def startup(self):\n        \"\"\"Optionally run some setup\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Optionally run some cleanup\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def my_handler(self, file_path, line, match):\n        field_1 = match.group(1)\n        field_2 = match.group(2)\n\n        sql = \"\"\"\n            INSERT INTO my_table (field_1, field_2)\n            VALUES\n                (%s, %s);\n        \"\"\"\n        params = (field_1, field_2)\n\n        self.queue_op(sql, params, run_now=False)\n\nrules = {\n    'example\\.log': {\n        '(.*),(.*)': 'my_handler',\n        '.*': 'skip'\n    }\n}\n\nhandler = MyHandler(\n    dsn='user:pass@localhost:5432/test',\n    setup_script='path/to/db_setup'\n)\n\nlog_processor = LogProcessor(\n    rules=rules,\n    handler=handler,\n    dry_run=False\n)\n\nlog_processor.run('/path/to/my/logs')\n```\n\n## The Handler class\nThe library only stipulates that the handler object passed to the `LogProcessor` object is an instance of `HandlerBase`.\n\nYou should subclass from `HandlerBase` and add your own methods to handle the lines found by your rules.\n\nOverride the `startup` and `shutdown` methods in your handler class to run a function at the start and end of parsing, respectively.\n\n### The PostgresHandler class\nOr, if you wish to make use of the included `PostgresHandler` for uploading data into a PostgreSQL database, subclass from that instead.\n\nThe PostgresHandler object has the following constructor:\n```python\nclass PostgresHandler(HandlerBase):\n    def __init__(self, dsn: Optional[str] = None, connection: Optional[Connection] = None, setup_script: Optional[str] = None, BATCH_SIZE: int = 1000):\n```\n\n- `dsn` optionally provide a dsn string which will be used to connect to an existing PostgreSQL database or;\n- `connection` optionally provide an existing psycopg3 connection. Useful for unit tests.\n- `setup_script` optionally provide the path to a SQL file in order to perform some database setup/cleanup in between runs.\n- `BATCH_SIZE` Execute database operations in batches of BATCH_SIZE, defaults to 1000.\n\nIn your handler functions, define a SQL string and args tuple, and pass them to the `queue_op` function. These should be setup according to the psycopg3 format, see the example above. If you wish to execute a database operation immediately, pass `run_now=True` to `queue_op`, otherwise, it will be added to a queue, and executed in sequence when the size of the queue reaches `BATCH_SIZE`.\n\n## Contributing\nAs mentioned above, the only data store that is currently supported is Postgres. If you would like to add support for another data store such as MySQL or MongoDB, then please open a pull request.\n",
