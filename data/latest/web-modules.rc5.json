    "description": "The Python Web Modules are a suite of simple and easy to use Python components\r\ndesigned to allow developers to write Python CGI scripts or web applications\r\nwith SQL databases, sessions, templates, email and authorisation functionality.\r\n\r\nA key part of the project is the creation of documentation and examples to allow\r\ndevelopers with less time or experience to begin Python web programming without\r\nhaving to read all the sources and comments from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nThe modules can easily be used on shared web hosting accounts running Apache and\r\nPython for example or with the built in webserver. They are designed to be\r\neasily accessible to beginners or developers currently using PHP or Perl whilst\r\nalso offering lower level APIs for experts to create powerful dynamic websites.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n\r\n    * The web.auth module has been completely re-written to include roles,\r\nencryption and much more.\r\n    * The web.session and web.auth modules have slighlty different APIs to\r\nremove the need for a separate Driver object.\r\n    * Most of the WSGI module has changed and the documentation been vastly\r\nimproved.\r\n    * Documentation and examples have been updated\r\n    * Removal of web.xml and libxml2 and libxslt. It was felt that there are\r\nplenty of good XML modules around and there was no point in including them in\r\nthe web modules when they can be chosen by a user who needs them anyway.",
