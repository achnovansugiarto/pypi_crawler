    "description": "=============================\nInstalling and Using pylibics\n=============================\n\n.. contents:: **Table of Contents**\n\n------------\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe Image Cytometry Standard (ICS) is a file format for images, primarily in\nmicroscopy imaging. The file format has been described by `Dean1990`_. ICS\nfiles allow to store further information on the imaging system along with the\nactual image (e.g aperture, light setting, microscope, and camera). Moreover,\nthe file format allows to store several integer format, floating point images as\nwell as complex valued images.\n\nThe library `libics`_ is a C library to read an write ICS image files. This\nmodule wraps the functions provided by libics to Python. Actual image data are\nreturned as numpy arrays. Numpy array in turn can be written to ICS image files.\n\n.. _Dean1990: Dean, P.; Mascio, L.; Ow, D.; Sudar, D. & Mullikin, J.\n    'Proposed standard for image cytometry data files'\n    Cytometry, Part A, 1990, 11, (5), 561-569\n    doi: 10.1002/cyto.990110502\n.. _libics: http://libics.sourceforge.net\n\nLimitations and known bugs\n--------------------------\n\n - Ics data written as version 2.0 is broken\n - Accessing ics history entries with the iterator interface\n   seems not to work properly\n - Compression appears to be not working\n\n-------------------------\nInstallation instructions\n-------------------------\n\nYou can download the `source code package`_ to compile everything yourself or\nyou can use easy_install to install the precompiled package (py2.6, win32 and\nlinux, x86_64). To compile the package please follow the instructions provided\nin the README file.\n\nWindows\n-------\n\nInstalling with easy_install is done by calling from the windows command\nprompt (C:\\>):\n\n  C:\\> easy_install pylibics\n\nLinux\n-----\n\nInstalling with easy_install is done by calling from the command prompt:\n\n  > easy_install pylibics\n\n.. _source code package: http://www.andre-bell.de/projects/pylibics/downloads\n\n-----\nUsage\n-----\n\nPlease see the `project homepage`_ for usage examples. Also refer to the\nexamples provided in the source package.\n\n.. _project homepage: http://www.andre-bell.de/projects/pylibics\n\n---------------\nRelease Changes\n---------------\n\n1.5.2b1, Released 2010-11-23\n * Basic support for libics",
