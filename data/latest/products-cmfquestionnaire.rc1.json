    "description": "CMFQuestionnaire is a simple questionnaire add-on for Plone.\nIts main features are:\n\n  * user-based or anonymous submissions (through a ticket system)\n\n  * pdf report creation with bar and pie charts for each question\n    (requires `reportlab`_)\n\n  * internationalization\n\n  * creates only 1 portal type for the questionnaire which is\n    internally represented as an XML document\n\n.. _reportlab: http://www.reportlab.org/\n\nUsing\n\n  * add a questionnaire like any other content type\n\n    check 'use_ticket' if you want to use tickets (see below)\n\n  * go to 'design' tab\n\n  * add a question or a group:\n\n    * enter the title of the group\n\n    * enter the scale of the group (the options will be numbered from\n      1 to this value)\n\n    * enter the legend to explain the options (put one option on each\n      line, starting with the option for 1)\n\n    * optionally, enter a description for the group\n\n    * add / remove questions to the group\n\n  * repeat for other groups if you have more\n\n  * publish the questionnaire (questionnaires can only be filled out\n    between their start and expiry dates)\n\n  * go to the Zope Management Interface, the 'Security' tab and check\n    the permissions on who can add, edit, fill-out and view the results\n    of the questionnaire\n\n  * go to the 'evaluate' tab and see the results or get a PDF report\n\n  Tickets\n\n    This mechanism was implemented to fulfil a need of my department\n    here at the Istanbul Technical University. At the end of each\n    term we present students with questionnaires for each course\n    they have taken in that term. Since our students have no users\n    on our site, we decided to hand out tickets that would enable\n    them to fillout the questionnaires even as anonymous visitors.\n    If you have a similar case, here's how it works:\n\n    * when editing the questionnaire, check 'use_ticket'\n\n    * go to the 'tickets' tab and create as many tickets as you like\n      (multiples of 15 are recommended, since they can be printed out\n      on a page)\n\n    * select 'list available tickets' and print that page\n      (*note*: the number of tickets displayed are always a multiple\n      of 3, so you may not be able to see the last 1 or 2 tickets)\n\n    * hand out the tickets to people you would like to participate\n      in the questionnaire\n\nYou can always find the latest information about CMFQuestionnaire on its\n`web page`_.  The source code is kept in a Subversion `repository`_.\n\n.. _web page: http://plone.org/products/cmfquestionnaire\n.. _repository: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/CMFQuestionnaire/\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0 - Unreleased\n----------------\n\n* Initial release",
