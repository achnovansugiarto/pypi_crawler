    "description": "****************************************************\npmpd: Git and Python Managed Project Deployments\n****************************************************\n\npmpd [git puhmp-eed] is a **command line interface for git deployments** \nthat release engineers can use to make life easier. It is heavily influenced by \nVincent Driessen's `branching model`_ and uses a syntax similar to `gitflow`_. \nIts goal is to simplify and streamline deployments of complex branching systems \nby making commands and actions as **human-friendly** as possible. It provides a \nsimple ``pmpd`` command that allows for merging and deploying branches to \nany number of distinct servers that are **connected by a common git server** \nlike `gitolite`_.\n\n.. contents::\n    :local:\n    :depth: 1\n    :backlinks: none\n\n=============\nMain Features\n=============\n\n* Expressive and intuitive syntax\n* Makes continuous integration easier\n* Release branches are pmpd out\n* Identify conflicting feature branches before release time\n* Automated pmpd deployments similar to Google's AppEngine approach\n* Multi server environments supported\n* Distributed branching model for large group collaborations\n\n============\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe latest **stable version** of pmpd can always be installed or updated to \nvia pip::\n\n    $ pip install --upgrade pmpd\n\n=============\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAfter installation is complete pmpd puts **.pmpd/config.json** into the root \nof your repository. You may want to add the folder to .gitignore, but leaving it \nthere is also a good way to keep track of your build history. pmpd.conf is used \nto relate servers to reference branches and to specify which feature branches \nbelong in a given release. \n\nYou must fill out **.pmpd/config.json** so that it matches the flow of your own \ndeployments and you'll probably update this file in some way every time a new \nrelease is pmpd out.\n\n=====\nUsage\n=====\n\nInitialize::\n\n    $ pmpd\n\nSynopsis::\n\n    $ pmpd [flags] [METHOD] [BRANCH]\n\n\nSee also ``pmpd --help``\n\n--------\nExamples\n--------\n\nBuild an alpha release based on the current state of production::\n\n    $ pmpd build alpha\n\n=========\nResources\n=========\n\n* `pmpd GitHub`_\n* `pmpd PyPI`_\n* `pmpd PyScape`_\n\n============\nContributers\n============\n\nJared Hall, `PyScape`_\n\n.. _branching model:   http://nvie.com/git-model\n.. _gitflow:          https://github.com/nvie/gitflow\n.. _gitolite:         https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite\n.. _PyScape:           http://www.pyscape.com/pmpd\n.. _pmpd GitHub:  https://github.com/jarederaj/pmpd\n.. _pmpd PyPI:    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pmpd/\n.. _pmpd PyScape:  http://www.pyscape.com/pmpd",
