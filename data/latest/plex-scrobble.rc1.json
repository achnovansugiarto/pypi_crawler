    "description": "plex-lastfm-scrobbler\n=====================\n\n|Build Status|\n\nplex-lastfm-scrobbler provides a set of scripts that allow you to\nscrobble played audio items to Last.FM from the Plex Media Server\napplication. plex-lastfm-scrobbler was built to run across platforms,\nthough only tested on Linux.\n\nA few points\n\n-  plex-lastfm-scrobbler is an out of process tool. Meaning it is not a\n   Plex Media Server plug-in. This tool runs separately of your Plex\n   Media Server.\n-  Must be run on the Plex Media Server\n-  Parses Plex Media Server logs for the 'got played' string in the log\n   file.\n-  Does not differentiate between clients. Meaning all media played,\n   will be scrobbled while the script is running.\n-  Your plex-media-server logs must be set at DEBUG level (not VERBOSE)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**Linux, OSX**\n\nIt is recommended (but not required) that you install this into a\nvirtualenvironment. This can be done as such.\n\n::\n\n    virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobbler\n    source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/bin/activate\n\nInstalling via ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` is supported. For example\n:``pip install plex-scrobble`` or ``easy_install plex-scrobble``.\n\nIf you wish to run development builds, fetch and install the source from\nthe github repo.\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler.git\n    cd plex-lastfm-scrobbler\n    python setup.py install\n    pip install -r dev_requirements.txt # for mock/testing packages.\n\nAlternatively, you can fetch the latest zip from github\n\n::\n\n    wget https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/archive/master.zip\n    unzip master.zip\n    cd plex-lastfm-scrobbler-master\n    python setup.py install\n\nYou're done.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nRun the wizard to generate config file\n\n::\n\n    plex-scrobble --wizard\n\nThe plex-lastfm-scrobbler configuration file (.plex-scrobble.toml) is\ninstalled to ~/ . The following configuration values are available.\n\nIf you're running Plex Media Server on a Linux based operating system,\nthings should work out of the box.\n\n::\n\n    [lastfm]\n    # REQUIRED: You'll need to create a last.fm API application first. Do so here:\n    # http://www.last.fm/api/account/create\n    api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n    api_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET\"\n    user_name = \"LAST_FM_USERNAME\"\n    password = \"LAST_FM_PASSWORD\"\n\n    [plex-scrobble]\n    # mediaserver_log_location references the log file location of the plex media server\n    # the default under /var/lib/... is the default install of plex media server on\n    # a Linux system. You may wish to change this value to reference your OS install.\n    # https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files\n    mediaserver_log_location = \"/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/Plex Media Server.log\"\n\n    # REQUIRED: Where do you wish to write the plex-scrobble log file.\n    log_file = \"/tmp/plex-scrobble.log\"\n\n    # REQUIRED: mediaserver_url is the location of the http service exposed by Plex Media Server\n    # the default values should be 'ok', assuming you're running the plex scrobble\n    # script from the same server as your plex media server\n    mediaserver_url = \"http://localhost:32400\"\n\n    # REQUIRED: a python data struture that stores failed scrobbles. plex-scrobble\n    # will retry on a 60 minute interval, maximum of 10 attempts if last.fm is\n    # experiencing issues.\n    cache_location = \"/tmp/plex_scrobble.cache\"\n\n    # OPTIONAL: plex_token defines the plex token used to get metadata\n    # Note: This is required if you use localhost or 127.0.0.1 and Plex Media Server >= 1.1.0\n    # You will know if you see a line like this your log_file:\n    # [plex_scrobble.plex_monitor fetch_metadata] [ERROR] urllib2 error reading from http://localhost:32400/library/metadata/48080 'HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized'\n    # Here is how you can obtain your token https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436-Finding-your-account-token-X-Plex-Token\n    plex_token = \"YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN\"\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nIf you installed plex-lastfm-scrobble to a virtual environment, enable\nthe virtual env.\n\n::\n\n    source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobber/bin/activate\n\nrun the application\n\n::\n\n    nohup plex-scrobble &\n\nTroubleshooting & Known Issues\n------------------------------\n\n-  If your Plex client supports the universal transcoder (see \"Old and\n   Universal transcoder @\n   https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250377-Transcoding-Media),\n   tracks will be scrobbled at the start of play. This is due to the way\n   that the universal transcoder writes to the Plex log file. See issue\n   11 (https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/issues/11) for\n   background discussion.\n-  We've seen instances when Plex Media Server does not report the\n   length of an audio file. This may occur before a full library analyze\n   has completed. When the track length is not reported by the Plex\n   Media Server, the song will not be scrobble. Try forcing the\n   \"Analyze\" audio library function.
