Lets say the player wants to consume a food item, we have a method\nthat takes care of that process. Our game has multiple functionality we need a way to identify the specific action/verb, also our method needs\nan argument to identify the food item.\n\n-  To extract the information we will make us of the 're module'\nit will detect the related synonyms and the argument required\n\n*    your patter must follow this format:   \n\n>   \"(synonyms)(\\s*)(?P\\<arg1>\\[word extractor]*)(\\s*)\"\n\n\n          # Example use\n          ...\n          synonym1 = r\"(consume)(\\s*)(?P<arg1>[\\w\\']*)(\\s*)\"\n          synonym2 = r\"(chow)(\\s*)(?P<arg1>[\\w\\']*)(\\s*)\"\n\n          eat.command_list = [synonym1, synonym2]\n\nWhat we did here is create our pattern that will capture the\nword \"consume\" or \"chow\" which are both words related to eating something. Followed by an optional white space character\n, lastly the argument which will be passed in to the method. \n\n>Always name the argument 'arg1'\n\n> You have the option of having all the synonyms in one pattern, but it will have a lot of clutter\n\n       # Example use\n\n       synonym = r\"([(chow)(consume)])(\\s*)(?P<html>[\\w\\']*)\"\n\n       eat.command_list = [synonym]\n\n\n-   After creating your pattern list you will be able to use the 'breaker' method. The method takes in the\nplayers input and test if their command is related to a specific Cmd object. It will return False if it doesnt find a match and if it\ndoes it will return an re.match object.\n\n**Method:** breaker(self)\n\n      # Example use\n\n      player_input1 = \"consume Pizza\"\n      player_input2 = \"fight villian\"\n\n      eat.breaker(player_input1)\n      >> re.match object; span(0, 13), match=\"consume Pizza\"\n\n      eat.breaker(player_input2)\n      >>False\n\nfrom the re.match object we can extract our argument value\n\n       # Example use\n\n       match = eat.breaker(player_input1)\n\n       print(match.group(\"arg1\"))\n       >>Pizza\n\n# Module: fight_move\n\nThe module provides the class for\ncreating fighting moves with their essential attributes\n\nUsed by the Player class instance and the Enemy class instance to\nbattle each other\n\n**Class:** Fight\n\n     def __init__(self, name, style=\"Normal\", damage=0):\n         self.name = name\n         self.damage = damage\n         self._desc = \"None\"\n         self._atck_desc = []\n         self.style = style\n\n*  **self.name**: Used to identify the fight move\n*  **self.damage**: Value used to subtract from opponent's hp attribute\n\n*  **self._desc**:  Description of the fight move.
