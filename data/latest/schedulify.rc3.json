    "description": "# Schedulify\n\nSchedulify is a tool for scheduling Python functions on Google Cloud Platform\nwith minimal boilerplate.\n\nNOTE: Schedulify is currently under development, so the full vision has not been\nrealized yet. If you use this tool, please expect significant changes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform offers Cloud Scheduler for running tasks according to a\nschedule. The process to set up a scheduled task involves many steps:\n\n*  Uploading the application. Depending on the runtime chosen, this may involve\n   containerizing the application and exposing the functions through a web\n   server.\n\n*  Creating and configuring a service account to establish trust between the\n   runtime and Cloud Scheduler.\n\n*  Creating a task in Cloud Scheduler.\n\nThe motivation behind this tool is to simplify this process.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use this tool, you must have:\n\n*  A Google Cloud project with billing enabled\n*  The following APIs enabled:\n   *  Cloud Build\n   *  Cloud Run\n   *  Cloud Scheduler\n*  [The Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)\n   installed on your computer\n*  A Python 3.7-compatible app with one or more functions that you want to run\n   periodically\n*  A `requirements.txt` file that specifies non-standard dependencies, if any\n\n## Status\n\nCurrently, the tool performs the following tasks, which are meant to be opaque\nto the user:\n\n*  Generates a Flask server that allows the invocation of the functions over\n   HTTP;\n*  Generates configs to containerize the app using the [Python 3.7\n   slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) Docker image;\n*  Submits the app to Cloud Build; and\n*  Starts a Cloud Build service.\n\nNote that the tool does not yet perform any operations in Cloud Scheduler.\nSupport for this along with many other improvements are forthcoming. Refer to\nthe Future Work section below for a full list of improvements.\n\nIf the above tasks provide utility for your workload and you are comfortable\nwith the instability that comes with a nascent tool, then you may proceed to the\nnext section which describes how to get started.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, install Schedulify:\n\n```\npip install schedulify\n```\n\nThen, navigate to your Python project that contains the functions you want to\nrun. Add a file named `shedulify.json`, formatted as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"project-id\": \"my-project-id\",\n    \"region\": \"us-west1\",\n    \"functions\": [\n        {\n            \"module\": \"my_module\",\n            \"function\": \"my_function\",\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAll function references are relative to where `schedulify.json` is location. If\nyour project contains a `requirements.txt` file, it must be present in the same\ndirectory as `schedulify.json`.\n\nNOTE: The scheduling portion of this tool is not implemented yet, so the\nconfiguration file does not accept configuration for how often the function\nshould be executed.\n\nAuthenticate through the Google Cloud SDK:\n\n```\ngcloud auth login\n```\n\nThen, from the directory that `schedulify.json` resides in, run:\n\n```\nschedulify\n```\n\nYou will see the `gcloud` invocations printed to standard out. You should see\nthe tool building the image and deploying it to Cloud Run.\n\n## Future Tasks\n\n*  Do not rely on `gcloud` for configuring Google Cloud Platform resources.\n*  (Maybe) Use Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions is probably good enough for most\n   use-cases and allows us to substantially reduce the complexity of\n   containerizing an arbitrary Python app.\n*  Add support for configuring Cloud Scheduler.\n\n## Development Guide\n\n### Performing a Release\n\nRefer to [Python's Packaging\ndocumentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project)\nfor full details on performing a release. Assuming all tools are set up, run the\nfollowing to push a new package to PyPI:\n\n```\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n\n\n",
