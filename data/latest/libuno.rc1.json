    "description": "# uno\n\n**uno** is a tool for interconnecting private LANs into a\n**unified virtual network**, or *UVN*, that supports fully routed,\nsite-to-site communications via dynamically managed encrypted links.\n\nThe *UVN* is composed of multiple *cells*, each one containing one or\nmore private networks, and managed by an *agent*.\n\n*Agents* connect to a common *registry* node, which administers the *UVN*,\nand provisions each *agent* with the latest *deployment configuration*. This\nspecifies the encrypted links that each *agent* will establish with other *cells*\nin order to form the *UVN*'s routing *backbone*.\n\n*Agents* use [RTI Connext DDS](https://www.rti.com/products/connext-dds-professional)\nto exchange information about their local networks and their operational status,\nover encrypted [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) links that connect them \nto each other, and to the registry node.\n\nOnce information about remote sites is available, and the VPN links have been\nproperly configured, the [Quagga](https://www.nongnu.org/quagga/) routing suite\nis used to implement the OSPF protocol between all nodes, and to enable complete\nrouting paths between all attached networks.\n\n*Agents* should be run in a dedicated host deployed within each LAN, and\nconfigured as the default gateway for other networks in the *UVN*, in order to\nallow transparent routing between all hosts.\n\nAn *agent* can also act as a DNS server for hosts in their attached LANs. The\nserver will automatically include entries for the dynamic VPN endpoints in\nthe *UVN*, in addition to any custom entry added to the *UVN*'s\nconfiguration.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install UNO is via the simplified installation script:\n\n```sh\ncurl -sSL https://uno.mentalsmash.org/install | sh\n```\n\nIf you have a pre-built wheel file for `connextdds-py` (e.g. if installing on\na Raspberry Pi), place it in the directory where you are running the\nscript, and it will be automatically detected and installed.\n\nIf a wheel file is not available, the script will try to clone and \nbuild `connextdds-py` from source. [RTI Connext DDS](https://github.com/mentalsmash/uno/wiki/Installation#rti-connext-dds) 6.x must\nbe installed on the system, and available via `NDDSHOME` for this to succeed.\n\nConsult the [Installation](https://github.com/mentalsmash/uno/wiki/Installation)\nsection of the wiki for more information on each installation step performed\nby the script.\n\n## Documentation\n\nVisit the [wiki](https://github.com/mentalsmash/uno/wiki) for more information\nabout **uno**.\n\nYou might want to start from [Hello UVN](https://github.com/mentalsmash/uno/wiki/Hello-UVN), which gives an overview of **uno**'s\nfeatures, and the structure of a *UVN*.",
