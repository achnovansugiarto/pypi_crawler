    "description": "# GreenLearning\n\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/greenlearning/badge/?version=latest)](https://greenlearning.readthedocs.io)\n\nGreenLearning is a deep learning library based on Tensorflow for learning [Green's functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function) associated with [partial differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator).\n\n| ![laplace_rational.png](docs/images/laplace.png) | \n|:--:| \n| *Exact and learned Green’s function of the Laplace operator..* |\n\nBelow is an example of the Green's function of a second-order differential operator with variable coefficients learned by `GreenLearning`.\n\n| ![laplace_rational.png](docs/images/variable_coeffs_rational.png) | \n|:--:| \n| *Learned Green’s function of a second order ODE with variable coefficients.* |\n\nSee [https://greenlearning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html](https://greenlearning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html) for more examples.\n\nThe library is maintained by [Nicolas Boullé](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/boulle/). If you are interested in using it, do not hesitate to get in contact with him at `boulle@maths.ox.ac.uk`.\n\n**Documentation**: [ReadTheDocs](https://greenlearning.readthedocs.io/)\n\n## Features\n\n- GreenLearning learns Green's functions and homogeneous solutions associated with scalar and systems of linearized partial differential equations in 1D and 2D with deep learning.\n- [Rational neural networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/a3f390d88e4c41f2747bfa2f1b5f87db-Paper.pdf) are implemented and used to increase the accuracy of the learned Green's functions.\n- GreenLearning requires no hyperparameter tuning to successfully learn Green's functions.\n- The neural networks can be created and trained easily with a few lines of code.\n- It is simple to generate the training datasets with MATLAB scripts.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\nGreenLearning relies on the following Python libraries:\n\n- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) >= 1.15.0\n- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n\n### How to install GreenLearning\n\n- For users, you can install the stable version with `pip`:\n```\npip install greenlearning\n```\nor with `conda`:\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge greenlearning\n```\n\n- For developers, you should clone the GitHub repository and install it manually on your machine::\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/NBoulle/greenlearning.git\ncd greenlearning\npip install -e.\n```\n\n## Citation\nPlease cite the following papers if you are using GreenLearning.\n\n- About GreenLearning:\n```\n@article{boulle2021data,\ntitle={Data-driven discovery of physical laws with human-understandable deep learning},\nauthor={Boull{\\'e}, Nicolas and Earls, Christopher J. and Townsend, Alex,\njournal={arXiv preprint arXiv:},\nyear={2021}\n}\n```\n- About Rational neural networks:\n```\n@inproceedings{boulle2020rational,\ntitle={Rational neural networks},\nauthor={Boull{\\'e}, Nicolas and Nakatsukasa, Yuji and Townsend, Alex},\nbooktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\nvolume = {33},\npages = {14243--14253},\nyear={2020},\nurl = {https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/a3f390d88e4c41f2747bfa2f1b5f87db-Paper.pdf}\n}\n```",
