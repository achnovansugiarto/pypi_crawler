    "description": "Gobpersist (Generic OBject PERSISTence) is an object persistence layer\nfor NoSQL, but it is also much more than that.\n\nGobpersist is modeled on the Django persistence layer, and in use\nyou'll find that it mostly behaves like a conventional\nobject/relational mapper (ORM).  However, unlike a conventional ORM,\nGobpersist does not insist that its data storage engine implements\nSQL, or that it follows a relational model at all.  Despite this,\nGobpersist intends to provide:\n\n* A complete SQL-like interface to querying its data.\n* ORM-style object peristence.\n* Atomic commits, depending on the atomicity of the back end.\n* Transparent support for caching.\n* Optional support for a separate storage engine to support very large\n  blobs.\n* Quick and easy development of interfaces to any back end.\n\nAll documentation is in the \"docs\" directory and online at\nhttp://accellion.github.com/gobpersist.\n\nTo contribute to Gobpersist, or to get more help:\n\n* Join the gobpersist mailing list, or read the archives, at\n  http://groups.google.com/group/gobpersist.\n\nGobpersist was developed by `Accellion <http://www.accellion.com>`_ and\nis released under the LGPLv2.1 license.",
