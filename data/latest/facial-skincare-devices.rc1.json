Add a [facial device / beauty tool](https://www.llskin.jp/) to your regular skin care routine to eliminate sagging and swollen face lines, blemishes, wrinkles, open pores, fine lines, and other skin problems and concerns, and get beautiful skin with ease!\n\nIn this article, we will introduce the types, how to choose, and recommended products for facial devices and steamers. We hope you will find it useful in selecting your favorite facial device and steamer.\n\n## What is a Facial Device? ##\n\nA facial device is a device that provides special care similar to that of a beauty salon in the comfort of your own home. They use heat, cold, vibration, electric current, and light to approach the skin and muscles to make the skin healthier and more beautiful.\n\nBy adding this device to your regular skin care regimen, you can expect to see positive effects for skin problems such as dryness, blackheads in pores, sagging of the face line, blemishes, and wrinkles.\n\n## Different types of facial devices ##\n\nThe following are the main types of facial devices.\n\n**RF (radio frequency)**: [RF (radio frequency) skin device](https://www.llskin.jp/products/via/), a type of electromagnetic wave, is irradiated to the skin to react with moisture inside the skin (down to the stratum corneum) to raise skin temperature and activate metabolism. It regulates skin turnover, facial flabbiness, etc.\n\n**Water-peeling**: Ultrasonic vibrations create a mist of water that removes dirt and dead skin cells from pores. Recommended for those who are concerned about dirty and rough skin.\n\n**Steamer**: Emits warm steam (vapor) or cold steam to softly envelop the entire face and condition the skin, making it easier for lotions and serums to penetrate to the horny layer. Recommended for dry skin.\n\n**Ionizing/Ionizing**: Ionizing/Ionizing/Ionizing type: Ionizing/Ionizing/Ionizing type applies a weak electric current to the skin to make it easier for beauty ingredients in lotions and serums to penetrate to the stratum corneum (introduction) and to remove dirt from the skin surface by adsorbing it (extraction).\n\n**EMS**: EMS stands for Electrical Muscle Stimulation. It applies a weak electric current to the muscles and approaches the facial muscles that cause loose skin around the cheeks and mouth. It is expected to lift face lines and tighten the skin.\n\n**Roller**: Rolling over the skin helps to improve blood circulation. Recommended for swelling, sagging, wrinkles, and lines.\n\n**Light (LED)**: [LED therapy](https://www.llskin.jp/products/yoko/) (Light Emitting Diode) light is irradiated onto the skin. Depending on the color of the light, it is possible to tailor the treatment to various skin types and concerns.\n\n- Blue: for acne care. Continued use of this product will reduce the risk of acne formation.\n- Yellow: For melanin care. It prevents spots and freckles caused by sunburn and improves skin tone.\n- Red: For aging skin, dry skin, and other age-appropriate anti-aging skin care.\n\n## How to Select a Facial device ##\n\nA wide variety of models with different types and functions are now available for facial devices. The following selection guide will help you find the right one for you.\n\n**Match it to your skin problems.**\n\nChoose a facial device that addresses your skin concerns. The following are recommended facial device types according to your concerns.\n\n- **Dry**: Steamer type, Ion-induction type\n- **Dirty pores, blackheads, acne**: Steamer type, water-peeling type, ion-guided type\n- **Swelling and sagging facial lines**: EMS type, RF (radio frequency) type, roller type\n- **Wrinkles and dullness**: Steamer type, light (LED) type\n- **Lack of firmness**: Steamer type, RF (radio frequency) type, light (LED) type\n\n**Check the time required for care.**\n\nWe recommend that the time and effort required for care of the [facial lifting tool](https://www.llskin.jp/products/mio2/) not be burdensome so that the user can continue to use it habitually. Check how often you will use it, how much time it will take per use, and whether the preparation and clean-up for using the facial device are not troublesome.\n\nA facial care device can be expected to be effective if you continue to use it, so choose one that fits your lifestyle and is easy to incorporate into your life and continue to use.\n\n**Ease of use and water resistance.**\n\nConvenience and ease of use are also important factors in the habitual use of a facial device.\nFor example, a cordless type facial device can be used anywhere without worrying about the power source. If it has a waterproof function, it can be used while bathing or around the washroom. If it is a compact type, it is easy to carry and can be used on the go or on vacation.\n\n## Popular facial devices manufacturers ##\n\nThe following popular manufacturers of facial device offer a wide range of lineups and support.\n\n**Panasonic**\n\nPanasonic, a major home appliance manufacturer, offers a wide range of beauty appliances for hair care, face care, and body care under the name Panasonic Beauty. Panasonic beauty appliances feature reliable performance and simple, easy-to-use designs. Popular products include the Steamer Nano Care, Ion Effector, and RF facial device.\n\n**L&L SKIN**\n\nL&L SKIN has seen countless women suffer from skin problems.
