Design primer sets for identification without input data preprocessing.\nSpecify the multi-FASTA file or the folder containing target sequences (FASTA or GenBank format) as input file(s) after the '-i' option.\n```\n $ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse\n```\nIt takes approx. 20 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the PC's performance. After the analysis, the results will be output in a `SampleData/Result/(Timestamp)identify_primer_set/` folder. The CSV file contains a results table as shown below with the analysis parameters.\n\n|| Arguments |\n|:--|--:|\n| Input_file_name | sample.fasta |\n| Target | Strain1, Strain2, ... , Strain N |\n| Exclude_file_name | None |\n| Exclude ||\n| Probe_size_range_description | 23-25 |\n| allowance | 0.15 |\n| cut_off_lower | 50 |\n| cut_off_upper | 1000 |\n| Interval_distance | 10000 |\n| Match_rate | 0.8 |\n| Result_output | 10000 |\n| Search_mode | sparse |\n| Window_size | 950 |\n| Maximum_annealing_site_number | 5 |\n| Score_calculation_mode | Fragment |\n\n\n| Primer1 | Primer2 | No. | Input sequence1 | Input sequence2 | ... | Input sequenceN | Score | Fragment number | Forward Tm_value | Reverse Tm_value | Tm_value difference |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| ATG..AA | AGC..TA | 1 | [(655, 1.0)] | [(528, 1.0)] | ... | [(411, 1.0)] | 1200 | N | 60.0 | 61.5 | 1.5 |\n| TAG..TC | GCC..TG | 2 | [(344, 1.0)] | [(257, 1.0)] | ... | [(499, 1.0)] | 1200 | N | 58.0 | 60.5 | 2.5 |\n\nInput sequence columns indicate the amplicon length amplified by Primers 1 and 2 and its ratio to the total amplicon number [(Amplicon length, Ratio)]. Therefore, if a primer set produces three amplicons (355 bp, 355 bp, and 652 bp) from whole genome DNA, the results would be [(355, 0.67), (652, 0.33)]. Each primer set can be used for identification; however, combining primer sets will make the identification easier and more accurate. When the analysis is run with default settings, three primer sets are selected, and a dendrogram based on the information of fragments amplified by each primer set will be generated in the 'Dendrogram' folder. The 'Combination_number' option (default: 3) can be used to adjust the number of primer sets used for identification. This algorithm `DIP` designs primer sets that produce fragments from all input sequences and **maximizes** the differences in the amplicon size or amplicon sequence among input sequences.\nTo confirm command-line options, type `shrs DIP -h`.\n\n<a id = \"2-design-universal-primer-sets-without-input-data-preprocessing\"></a>\n### 2. Design universal primer sets without input data preprocessing.\nSpecify the Multi-FASTA or the folder containing the target sequences (FASTA or GenBank format) as input file(s) after the '-i' option. In the following case, the design primer set can amplify genome DNAs of three strains of *Mycoplasma genitalium* and NOT produce any amplicons from genome DNA of one strain of *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*. \n```\n $ shrs DUP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -e SampleData/Mpneumoniae.fasta -a 0.25 -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse\n```\nIt takes approx. 5–10 minutes, depending on the PC's performance. After the analysis, the results will be output in a `SampleData/Result/(Timestamp)universal_primer_set/` folder. The format of the outputted CSV file is almost the same as that obtained for the results of a DIP analysis as mentioned above (see Procedure 1). This algorithm `DUP` designs primer sets that produce fragments from all input sequences and **minimizes** the differences in the amplicon size among input sequences. Note that the primer sets are designed to produce only one amplicon from each input sequence when `shrs DUP` is used.\n\nTo confirm command-line options, type `shrs DUP -h`.\n\n<a id = \"3-design-primer-sets-for-identification-with-input-data-preprocessing\"></a>\n### 3. Design primer sets for identification with input data preprocessing.\nEach sequence that is input into the `DIP` subcommand at the same time is processed for differentiation from each other. Therefore, if an inputted multi-FASTA file has plasmid or multiple contig sequences of an identical strain, the primer set obtained will produce some amplicons that correspond to inputted contigs or plasmid. To avoid this problem, if genome DNA of an identical strain has been divided into multiple contigs, all contigs and the plasmid should be preprocessed (concatenated) prior to the `DIP` analysis, using the following subcommand. One multi-FASTA file for preprocessing must contain the contigs and plasmid derived from a single strain. Organize all multi-FASTA files in one folder when there are some multi-FASTA files, and then specify the folder path as the input file path.\n```\n $ shrs ISP -i SampleData/contig/ -o SampleData/Preprocessed_data1/ --Single_file\n```\nA preprocessed multi-FASTA file will be generated, and then the preprocessed multi-FASTA file is analyzed by `shrs DIP`.\n\n```\n $ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Preprocessed_data1/ -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse\n```\nThis algorithm `DIP` designs primer sets that produce fragments from all input sequences and **maximizes** the differences in the amplicon size or amplicon sequence among input sequences.\n\nTo confirm command-line options, type `shrs DIP -h` or `shrs ISP -h`.\n\n<a id = \"4-design-universal-primer-sets-with-input-data-preprocessing\"></a>\n### 4. Design universal primer sets with input data preprocessing.\nAs mentioned above, if genome DNA of an identical strain has been divided into multiple contigs, all contigs and the plasmid should be preprocessed (concatenated) prior to a `DUP` analysis by using following subcommand. One multi-FASTA file for preprocessing must contain contigs and plasmid derived from a single strain. Organize all multi-FASTA files in one folder when there are some multi-FASTA files, and then specify the folder path as the input file path.\n```\n $ shrs ISP -i SampleData/contig/ -o SampleData/Preprocessed_data2/ --Single_file\n```\nA preprocessed multi-FASTA file will be generated, and then the preprocessed multi-FASTA file is analyzed by `shrs DUP`.\n\n```\n $ shrs DUP -i SampleData/Preprocessed_data2 -e SampleData/Mpneumoniae.fasta -a 0.20 -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse\n```\nThis algorithm `DUP` designs primer sets that produce fragments from all input sequences and **minimizes** the differences in the amplicon size among input sequences. Note that the primer sets are designed to produce only one amplicon from each input sequence when `shrs DUP` is used.\n\nTo confirm command-line options, type `shrs DUP -h` or `shrs ISP -h`.\n\n<a id = \"re-analysisadditional-analysis\"></a>\n## Re-analysis/Additional analysis\nNew sequences can be analyzed based on primer sets in a CSV file obtained from `shrs DIP` or `shrs DUP`. Delete the rows containing unnecessary primer sets, since an analysis of them would take a long time. Do not include blank rows between the rows containing primer sets.\n```\n $ shrs AA -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_M6282.fasta -f SampleData/Previous_DIP_Result.csv -o SampleData/New_result/\n```\n\n<a id = \"in-silico-pcr\"></a>\n## *in silico* PCR\nYou can get amplicon information by using *in silico* PCR. \n```\n $ shrs iPCR -i SampleData/GenBank/ -fwd CTACACCCATTTACCCAACAGTATC -rev TCTCATTGGWAACATTCGGTACATC -o SampleData/insilicoPCR_Result/\n```\nA CSV file will be output with default settings. If you prefer FASTA over CSV, use the '--fasta' option. When you need to know the primer annealing site positions on a template sequence, use the '--Position_index' option. You can obtain the annotation information of amplicons, when a GenBank file is analyzed by *in silico* PCR with the '--Annotation' option.\n```\n $ shrs iPCR -i SampleData/GenBank/ -fwd CTACACCCATTTACCCAACAGTATC -rev TCTCATTGGWAACATTCGGTACATC -o SampleData/insilicoPCR_annotation_Result/ --Annotation\n```\n\n<a id = \"tips-some-command-line-options\"></a>\n## Tips: Some command line options\n- '--circularDNA'/'--exclude_circularDNA' option {AA, DIP, DUP, ISP, iPCR}\n\n    When input sequence file(s) contains one or more circular DNA sequence(s), use this option. Specify which sequence is circular DNA by using a subargument. All input sequences are processed as linear DNA in default settings ('n/a'). When all input sequences are circular DNA, use 'all' after the --circularDNA/--exclude_circularDNA option. For each individual sequence, you can specify whether the sequence is circular DNA or not by using 'individually'. You can also specify whether or not a sequence is circular DNA by inputting the file path of text file, as shown below.\n\n            Text file example:\n                Sequence_name1 circularDNA\n                Sequence_name2 linearDNA\n                Sequence_name3 linearDNA\n                           ... \n                Sequence_nameN circularDNA\n\n```\n $ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse --circularDNA SampleData/circularDNA.txt\n```\n\n- '--Search_mode' option {DIP, DUP}\n\n    The '--Search_mode' option contains four choices: 'exhaustive', 'moderate', 'sparse', and 'manual'. Primer candidates will be generated by cutting every N-base from the reference sequence. The N-value is different depending on each Search_mode.\n\n    | Subargument | N-bases |\n    |:--|:--|\n    | exhaustive | 1 base. Same as N-gram method (N: primer size) |\n    | moderate | One-third of primer size (Maximum: 10 bases) |\n    | sparse | primer size |\n    | manual | primer size * Ratio inputed by user |\n\n```\n $ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -o SampleData/ --Search_mode manual 2\n```\n\n- '-a' option {DIP, DUP}\n\n    When the '-e' and '--Exclude_mode fast' options are used, the larger the value allowance is, the fewer in number the candidates will be.\n\n- '--Score_calculation' option {DIP}\n\n    When 'Sequence' is selected in this option, the cumulative score of sequence homology among amplicons is used as an indicator to evaluate primer set candidates instead of the score calculated from fragment length. When this option is used, only primer sets that produce a single amplicon from the template sequence will be obtained because calculation of a sequence homology takes a long time. Additionally, a multiple alignment tool (MAFFT program) is required to generate a dendrogram when 'Sequence' is specified in 'Score_calculation' option. Before running this script, please install MAFFT and add the binary of MAFFT to your PATH. The dendrogram is constructed based on the UPGMA method, and the distance matrix calculated by the identity matrix. The gap(s) in the alignment(s) are used to calculate distance (NOT ignored). Note that the dendrogram obtained indicates the similarity of alignment sequences containing gap(s), and it does not always indicate the evolutionary relationships.\n```\n $ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse --Score_calculation Sequence\n```\n\n- '-g' or '--Group_id' option {DIP}\n\n    When this option is used, the algorithm tries to minimize the score between the sequences in intra-group and maximize the score between the sequences in inter-group. You can specify which sequences are same group by inputting the file path of text file, as shown below. You can specify commas, spaces or tab character as a separator in the text file.\n    Please avoid to contain a sequence name in ID like as the combination of sequence name 'D12' and ID 'SeqID12'.\n\n            Text file example:\n                Sequence_name1 1\n                Sequence_name2 2\n                Sequence_name3 3\n                           ... \n                Sequence_nameN 2\n```\n$ shrs DIP -i SampleData/Mgenitalium_3strains.fasta -o SampleData/ --Search_mode sparse --Group_id SampleData/Group_id.txt\n```\n- '--Fragment_size_pattern_matrix' and/or '--Fragment_start_position_matrix' option {DIP}\n\n    When you would like to switch 'Score_calculation mode' to another one (or sometimes generate new dendrograms), it is possible to reanalyze same dataset in less time than before by specifying Fragment_size_pattern_matrix.csv and/or Fragment_start_position_matrix that has already obtained after --Fragment_size_pattern_matrix and/or --Fragment_start_position_matrix option.\n    When 'Fragment' mode will be used, you specify only 'Fragment_size_pattern_matrix.csv'. On the other hand, both 'Fragment_size_pattern_matrix.csv' and 'Fragment_start_position_matrix.csv' have to be specified, when 'Sequence' mode will be used.\n\n<a id = \"command-line-options\"></a>\n## Command-line options\n<details><summary>Design identification primer sets {DIP}</summary>\n\n```\nshrs DIP -i <input file> [options]\n```\nBelow is the full list of supported options for the `DIP` command line.\n\n|Option|Description|\n|:--|:--|\n| -i, --input_file | Input file path (required, format: FASTA or Genbank) |\n| -e, --exclude_file | File path for exclusion sequence(s).

A FASTA file will be generated if you use this option. |\n| --Single_file | Output format. One single FASTA-format file will be generated even if you input some separate FASTA files, when using this option with the '--fasta' option. |\n| --Mismatch_allowance | The acceptable mismatch number (default: 0) |\n| --Only_one_amplicon | Only one amplicon is outputted, even if multiple amplicons are obtained by PCR when you use this option. |\n| --Position_index | The result has the information of the amplification position when this option is enabled. |\n| --circularDNA | If there are some circular DNAs in the input sequences, use this option (default: n/a. It means all input sequences are linear DNA. When there are some circular DNA input sequences, type 'all', 'individually', 'n/a', or the file path of the text that specify which sequence is circularDNA, after the '--circularDNA' option.) |\n| --gene_annotation_search_range | The gene annotation search range in the GenBank-format file. (default: 100) |\n| --Annotation | If the input sequence file is in GenBank format, the amplicon(s) is annotated automatically. |\n| --warning | Shows all warnings when you use this option |\n</details>\n\n---\n<a id = \"functions-contained-in-library-of-shrs\"></a>\n# Functions contained in library of `shrs`\n- shrslib.basicfunc\n    - class nucleotide_sequence\n    - complementary_sequence\n    - calculate_Tm_value\n    - read_sequence_file\n- shrslib.explore\n    - search_position\n    - PCR_amplicon\n- shrslib.scores\n    - calculate_flexibility\n    - calculate_score\n    - calculate_diff_length_score\n    - fragment_size_distance\n    - array_diff\n    - sequence_duplicated\n\nSee [documentation](https://ilvsblfsh.github.io/SampleData/) for more detailed information.\n\n---\n<a id = \"citation\"></a>\n# Citing SHRS\nPlease cite the following article:\n\nTakahashi, M., Morikawa, K., Akao, T., 2022.
