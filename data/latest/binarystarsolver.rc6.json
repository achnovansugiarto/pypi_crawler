    "description": "## AUTHORS\n\nCaroline Barton, Dalhousie University and Nicholas Milson, Dalhousie University\n\n## SUPERVISOR\n\nDr. Philip Bennett, Dalhousie University\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\nIn your command line, call _pip install BinaryStarSolver_.\nThen, in your python code, write: _from binarystarsolve.binarystarsolve import StarSolve_\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nGiven a series of radial velocities as a function of time for a star in a binary system, this program solves for various orbital parameters. Namely, it solves for eccentricity (e), argument of periastron (ω), velocity amplitude (K), long term average radial velocity (γ), and orbital period (P).\n\nIf the orbital parameters of a primary star are already known, the program can also find the orbital parameters of a companion star, with only a few radial velocity data points.\n\nIn the case of double-lined binary where both stars have equally good orbital coverage, then the program can solve for the orbital parameters of both stars at once.\n\nNote that K = n * a1 * sin(i) / ((1-e)^0.5), where a1 is the primary star's semi-major axis, n is the mean motion (n = 2π / P), and i is the inclination angle of the orbit.\n\nThe equation the data is being fitted to is V(t) = γ + K*(cos(v(t) + ω) + e*cos(ω)), where v(t) is the true anomaly (angle from periastron).\n\nFor more information on the implementation of this code, refer to the paper \"A Python Code to Determine Orbital Parameters of Spectroscopic Binaries\": https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13914 (But also note the solving for both stars at once case may not be on the paper right away, but it should be there soon!)\n\n## USER INSTRUCTIONS\n\nAll the functionality of this program is accessed via the function StarSolve(). Whether the parameters being solved for are for a primary star or a companion star (or both at once), StarSolve() is to be used.\n\nThe first two arguments of the function StarSolve() are data_file and star. data_file is a string, which is either the name of the txt file (if the file is in your working directory), or the file path (if the file is not in the working directory). star is also a string, where the three options are \"primary\", \"secondary\", or \"both\". Note that star is not case sensitive.\n\n## PRIMARY STAR APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nFor solving the parameters of the primary star, this program works for two general types of radial velocity data sets. It works for data sets where all the data is from a singular deduction of the radial velocities. It also works for data sets which are composed of sub data sets, where each sub data set's radial velocities were deduced separately from the other subsets. Having a data set composed of subsets with radial velocities deduced separately may result in discrepancies of the long term average radial velocity (γ) between the subsets. This program can deal with this discrepancy by choosing one of the sub data sets' γ as the \"true\" γ, and shifting the other sub data set's radial velocities to match up with the chosen subset.\n\nFor the case where all the data is from a singular deduction of the radial velocities, the user must supply their radial velocity data they wish to fit as a tab separated txt file, with the first value being the time in Reduced Julian Date (RJD), the second being the radial velocity in km/s, and the third (optional) value being the weights.\n\nFor the case with the RV data set composed of multiple sub data sets, the user must supply their radial velocity data they wish to fit as a tab separated txt file, with the first value being the time in Reduced Julian Date (RJD), the second being the radial velocity in km/s, the third value being the weights, and the fourth value being an integer signifying which sub data set the data comes from. Note, if the user does not wish to assign weights to the data, the third column still must be filled and thus should be a column of ones.\n\nIf the period of the orbit is already known, the user may pass in a float with the keyword argument Period (with the period in days). If the period of the orbit is already known, but the user would still like the period to be solved for, the user may pass in a float with the keyword argument Pguess (in days).\n\nIf the user would like the estimated covariance matrix returned, the boolean keyword argument covariance may be passed in as True. If the period is previously known (and passed in using Period), the covariance matrix returned will be a 5 by 5 matrix. Otherwise, it will be a 6 by 6. By default, when star = \"primary\", StarSolve() creates two plots of the fit (one for RV vs RJD, one for RV vs phase). If the user would not like these graphs shown, they may use the optional boolean keyword graphs, and set it as False.\n\nFor circular orbits (e = 0), the argument of periastron (ω) becomes undefined. If the user has reason to believe that the eccentricity is 0, they may pass in the optional boolean keyword parameter zeroEcc as True. This will set e and ω to 0 for the minimization, making the minimization run faster. It is also acceptable to have zeroEcc = False for circular orbits, but just note that the ω returned will not mean anything physcally. \n\nStarSolve will return a list of the solved parameters (along with asini and f(M)), in the order [γ, K, ω, e, T0, P, asin(i), f(M)], followed by a list of uncertainties associated with each parameter (and asin(i) and f(M)). As previously stated, the argument keyword covariance may be passed as True, so that the covariance matrix is returned too\n\nWarning: If no Period or Pguess is provided, StarSolve() cannot find reliable results if the RV data supplied does not span at least 1.5 periods and will fail if the data spans less than one full period. Furthermore, if the data set is composed of multiple sub data sets with different γ velocities, the program may fail to correct the offset in γ velocities if none of the sub data sets span at least 1.5 periods. Using a period determined by other methods (e.g. photometrically) is often preferable to allowing the program to solve for the period. The convergence of the minimization is fairly sensitive to initial period estimates.\n\n**Examples**:\n\nparams, err = StarSolve(data_file = \"myRVdata.txt\", star = \"primary\")\n\nparams, err, C = StarSolve(data_file = \"myRVdata.txt\", star = \"primary\", Period = 3784.3, covariance = True)\n\nparams, err = StarSolve(data_file = \"myRVdata.txt\", star = \"primary\", Pguess = 7430, graphs = False)\n\n## COMPANION STAR APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe RV data must be formatted the same way for star = \"secondary\" as for star = \"primary\", i.e. as a tab separated txt file, with the first value being the time in Reduced Julian Date (RJD), the second being the radial velocity in km/s, and the third (optional) value being the weights.\n\nTo find the parameters of a companion star, a list of the known parameters of the primary star, in the order [γ, K, ω, e, T0, P] (with ω in degrees), must be passed in using the keyword argument X.\n\nIf the user wishes to return the error on the parameters of the companion star, they must also input a list of errors of the known parameters of the primary star (in the order [γ, K, ω, e, T0, P]), using the keyword err.\n\nDue to various observational reasons, there is often a discrepancy between the average radial velocity of the primary's γ1, and the companion star's γ2, though both should be equal. γ1 is assumed to be the \"correct\" γ, and is the γ returned; but for purposes of fitting the curve to the data, a γ2 is solved for. Using the boolean keyword shift = True, the discrepancy between average velocities (γ2 - γ1) is returned.\n\nBy default, when star = \"secondary\", StarSolve() creates two plots of the fit (one for RV vs RJD, one for RV vs phase). If the user would not like these graphs shown, they may use the optional boolean keyword graphs, and set it as False.\n\n**Examples**:\n\nparams = StarSolve(data_file = \"companion.txt\", star = \"secondary\", X = [-6.4354, 13.956, 203.991, 0.20544, 56108.8, 3770.68])\n\nparams,err = StarSolve(data_file = \"companion.txt\", star = \"secondary\", X = [-6.4354, 13.956, 203.991, 0.20544, 56108.8, 3770.68], err = [0.025298, 0.034264, 0.613298, 0.0020712, 5.80324, 0])\n\nparams,shift = StarSolve(data_file = \"companion.txt\", star = \"secondary\", X = [-6.4354, 13.956, 203.991, 0.20544, 56108.8, 3770.68], shift = True, graphs = False)\n\n##  PRIMARY AND SECONDARY STARS TOGETHER APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSolving the parameters of both stars at once using the keyword star = \"both\" only works for data sets that for every time t, there is a V_1(t) point and a V_2(t) point.\n\nLike with the star = \"primary\" case, the program works for two general types of radial velocity data sets. It works for data sets where all the data is from a singular deduction of the radial velocities. It also works for data sets which are composed of sub data sets, where each sub data set's radial velocities were deduced separately from the other subsets (so the γ's may be different). For the both stars case, this program deals with this discrepancy by finding γ for each sub data set, performing a weighted average to get a value of γ, and then shifting all the data sets to said weighted average value of γ. \n\nFor the case where all the data is from a singular deduction of the radial velocities, the user must supply their radial velocity data they wish to fit as a tab separated txt file, with the first value being the time in Reduced Julian Date (RJD), the second being the radial velocity of the primary star in km/s, the third being the radial velocity of the secondary star in km/s, and the fourth and fifth (optional) values being the respective weights of the primary and second star's radial velocities.\n\nFor the case with the RV data set composed of multiple sub data sets, the user must supply their radial velocity data they wish to fit as a tab separated txt file, with the first value being the time in Reduced Julian Date (RJD), the second being the primary star's radial velocity in km/s, the third value being the companion star's radial velocity in km/s, the fourth and fifth values being the respective weights of the primary and second star's radial velocities, and the sixth value being an integer signifying which sub data set the data comes from. Note, if the user does not wish to assign weights to the data, the fourth and fifth columns still must be filled and thus should be a column of ones.\n\nIf the period of the orbit is already known, the user may pass in a float with the keyword argument Period (with the period in days). If the period of the orbit is already known, but the user would still like the period to be solved for, the user may pass in a float with the keyword argument Pguess (in days).\n\nIf the user would like the estimated covariance matrices returned, the boolean keyword argument covariance may be passed in as True. This returns two covariance matrices (one for each star - primary star first). If the period is previously known (and passed in using Period), the covariance matrices returned will be 5 by 5 matrix. Otherwise, they will be 6 by 6. \n\nBy default, when star = \"both\", StarSolve() creates four plots of the fits (one for RV vs RJD of the primary star, one for RV vs phase of the primary, one for RV vs RJD of the companion star, and one for RV vs phase of the companion). If the user would not like these graphs shown, they may use the optional boolean keyword graphs, and set it as False.\n\nFor circular orbits (e = 0), the argument of periastron (ω) becomes undefined. If the user has reason to believe that the eccentricity is 0, they may pass in the optional boolean keyword parameter zeroEcc as True. This will set e and ω to 0 for the minimization, making the minimization run faster. It is also acceptable to have zeroEcc = False for circular orbits, but just note that the ω returned will not mean anything physically. \n\nWhen star = \"both\", StarSolve will return a list of the solved parameters for each star  (along with asini and f(M)), in the order [γ, K, ω, e, T0, P, asin(i), f(M)], followed by a list for each star of uncertainties associated with each parameter (and asin(i) and f(M)). As previously stated, the argument keyword covariance may be passed as True, so that the covariance matrices are returned too. Note that for all these lists, the primary star's are returned first. \n\n**Examples**:\n\nparams, err, C = StarSolve(data_file = \"rvData.txt\", star = \"both\",covariance = True, zeroEcc = True)\n\nparams, err = StarSolve(data_file = \"rvData.txt\", star = \"both\", Pguess = 33.8, graphs = False)\n\n\n\nIf there are any questions, please contact me at nick.milson@dal.ca\n\n",
