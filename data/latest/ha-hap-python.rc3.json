To kick-start things,\nyou can open `main.py` or `busy_home.py`, where you will find some fake accessories.\nJust run one of them, for example `python3 busy_home.py`, and you can add it in\nthe Home app (be sure to be in the same network).\nStop it by hitting Ctrl+C.\n\nThere are example accessories as well as integrations with real products\nin [the accessories folder](accessories). See how to configure your camera in\n[camera_main.py](camera_main.py).\n\n## Table of Contents\n1. [API](#API)\n2. [Installation](#Installation)\n3. [Setting up a camera](#Camera)\n4. [Run at boot (and a Switch to shutdown your device)](#AtBoot)\n5. [Notice](#Notice)\n\n## Installation <a name=\"Installation\"></a>\n\nAs of version 3.5.1, HAP-python no longer supports python older than 3.6, because we\nare moving to asyncio. If your platform does not have a compatible python out of the\nbox, you can install it manually or just use an older version of HAP-python.\n\nAs a prerequisite, you will need Avahi/Bonjour installed (due to zeroconf package).\nOn a Raspberry Pi, you can get it with:\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev\n```\n`avahi-utils` may also fit the bill. Then, you can install with `pip3` (you will need `sudo` or `--user` for the install):\n```sh\n$ pip3 install HAP-python[QRCode]\n```\n\nThis will install HAP-python in your python packages, so that you can import it as `pyhap`. To uninstall, just do:\n```\n$ pip3 uninstall HAP-python\n```\n\n## API <a name=\"API\"></a>\n\nA typical flow for using HAP-python starts with implementing an Accessory. This is done by\nsubclassing [Accessory](pyhap/accessory.py) and putting in place a few details\n(see below). After that, you give your accessory to an AccessoryDriver to manage. This\nwill take care of advertising it on the local network, setting a HAP server and\nrunning the Accessory. Take a look at [main.py](main.py) for a quick start on that.\n\n```python\nfrom pyhap.accessory import Accessory, Category\nimport pyhap.loader as loader\n\nclass TemperatureSensor(Accessory):\n    \"\"\"Implementation of a mock temperature sensor accessory.\"\"\"\n\n    category = Category.SENSOR  # This is for the icon in the iOS Home app.\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Here, we just store a reference to the current temperature characteristic and\n        add a method that will be executed every time its value changes.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If overriding this method, be sure to call the super's implementation first.\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        # Add the services that this Accessory will support with add_preload_service here\n        temp_service = self.add_preload_service('TemperatureSensor')\n        self.temp_char = temp_service.get_characteristic('CurrentTemperature')\n\n        # Having a callback is optional, but you can use it to add functionality.\n        self.temp_char.setter_callback = self.temperature_changed\n\n    def temperature_changed(self, value):\n        \"\"\"This will be called every time the value of the CurrentTemperature\n        is changed. Use setter_callbacks to react to user actions, e.g. setting the\n        lights On could fire some GPIO code to turn on a LED (see pyhap/accessories/LightBulb.py).\n        \"\"\"\n        print('Temperature changed to: ', value)\n\n    @Acessory.run_at_interval(3)  # Run this method every 3 seconds\n    # The `run` method can be `async` as well\n    def run(self):\n        \"\"\"We override this method to implement what the accessory will do when it is\n        started.\n\n        We set the current temperature to a random number. The decorator runs this method\n        every 3 seconds.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.temp_char.set_value(random.randint(18, 26))\n\n    # The `stop` method can be `async` as well\n    def stop(self):\n        \"\"\"We override this method to clean up any resources or perform final actions, as\n        this is called by the AccessoryDriver when the Accessory is being stopped.\n        \"\"\"\n        print('Stopping accessory.')\n```\n\n## Service Callbacks\n\nWhen you are working with tightly coupled characteristics such as \"On\" and \"Brightness,\"\nyou may need to use a service callback to receive all changes in a single request.\n\nWith characteristic callbacks, you do now know that a \"Brightness\" characteristic is\nabout to be processed right after an \"On\" and may end up setting a LightBulb to 100%\nand then dim it back down to the expected level.\n\n```python\nfrom pyhap.accessory import Accessory\nfrom pyhap.const import Category\nimport pyhap.loader as loader\n\nclass Light(Accessory):\n    \"\"\"Implementation of a mock light accessory.\"\"\"\n\n    category = Category.CATEGORY_LIGHTBULB  # This is for the icon in the iOS Home app.\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Here, we just store a reference to the on and brightness characteristics and\n        add a method that will be executed every time their value changes.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If overriding this method, be sure to call the super's implementation first.\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        # Add the services that this Accessory will support with add_preload_service here\n        serv_light = self.add_preload_service('Lightbulb')\n        self.char_on = serv_light.configure_char('On', value=self._state)\n        self.char_brightness = serv_light.configure_char('Brightness', value=100)\n\n        serv_light.setter_callback = self._set_chars\n\n    def _set_chars(self, char_values):\n        \"\"\"This will be called every time the value of the on of the\n        characteristics on the service changes.\n        \"\"\"\n        if \"On\" in char_values:\n            print('On changed to: ', char_values[\"On\"])\n        if \"Brightness\" in char_values:\n            print('Brightness changed to: ', char_values[\"Brightness\"])\n\n    @Acessory.run_at_interval(3)  # Run this method every 3 seconds\n    # The `run` method can be `async` as well\n    def run(self):\n        \"\"\"We override this method to implement what the accessory will do when it is\n        started.\n\n        We set the current temperature to a random number. The decorator runs this method\n        every 3 seconds.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.char_on.set_value(random.randint(0, 1))\n        self.char_brightness.set_value(random.randint(1, 100))\n\n    # The `stop` method can be `async` as well\n    def stop(self):\n        \"\"\"We override this method to clean up any resources or perform final actions, as\n        this is called by the AccessoryDriver when the Accessory is being stopped.\n        \"\"\"\n        print('Stopping accessory.')\n```\n\n## Setting up a camera <a name=\"Camera\"></a>\n\nThe [Camera accessory](pyhap/camera.py) implements the HomeKit Protocol for negotiating stream settings,\nsuch as the picture width and height, number of audio channels and others.\nStarting a video and/or audio stream is very platform specific. Because of this,\nyou need to figure out what video and audio settings your camera supports and set them\nin the `options` parameter that is passed to the `Camera` Accessory. Refer to the\ndocumentation for the `Camera` contructor for the settings you need to specify.\n\nBy default, HAP-python will execute the `ffmpeg` command with the negotiated parameters\nwhen the stream should be started and will `terminate` the started process when the\nstream should be stopped (see the default: `Camera.FFMPEG_CMD`).\nIf the default command is not supported or correctly formatted for your platform,\nthe streaming can fail.\n\nFor these cases, HAP-python has hooks so that you can insert your own command or implement\nthe logic for starting or stopping the stream. There are two options:\n\n1. Pass your own command that will be executed when the stream should be started.\n\n    You pass the command as a value to the key `start_stream_cmd` in the `options` parameter to\n    the constuctor of the `Camera` Accessory. The command is formatted using the\n    negotiated stream configuration parameters. For example, if the negotiated width\n    is 640 and you pass `foo start -width {width}`, the command will be formatted as\n    `foo start -width 640`.\n\n    The full list of negotiated stream configuration parameters can be found in the\n    documentation for the `Camera.start` method.\n\n2. Implement your own logic to start, stop and reconfigure the stream.\n\n    If you need more flexibility in managing streams, you can directly implement the\n    `Camera` methods `start`, `stop` and `reconfigure`. Each will be called when the\n    stream should be respectively started, stopped or reconfigured. The start and\n    reconfigure methods are given the negotiated stream configuration parameters.\n\n    Have a look at the documentation of these methods for more information.\n\nFinally, if you can take snapshots from the camera, you may want to implement the\n`Camera.snapshot` method. By default, this serves a stock photo.\n\n## Run at boot <a name=\"AtBoot\"></a>\nThis is a quick way to get `HAP-python` to run at boot on a Raspberry Pi. It is recommended\nto turn on \"Wait for network\" in `raspi-config`. If this turns to be unreliable, see\n[this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=187225).\n\nCopy the below in `/etc/systemd/system/HAP-python.service` (needs sudo).\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription = HAP-python daemon\nWants = pigpiod.service  # Remove this if you don't depend on pigpiod\nAfter = local-fs.target network-online.target pigpiod.service\n\n[Service]\nUser = lesserdaemon  # It's a good idea to use some unprivileged system user\n# Script starting HAP-python, e.g. main.py\n# Be careful to set any paths you use, e.g. for persisting the state.\nExecStart = /usr/bin/python3 /home/lesserdaemon/.hap-python/hap-python.py\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy = multi-user.target\n```\n\nTest that everything is fine by doing:\n\n```sh\n> sudo systemctl start HAP-python\n> systemctl status HAP-python\n> sudo journalctl -u HAP-python  # to see the output of the start up script.\n> sudo systemctl stop HAP-python\n```\n\nTo enable or disable at boot, do:\n\n```sh\n> sudo systemctl enable HAP-python\n> sudo systemctl disable HAP-python\n```\n\n### Shutdown switch\n\nIf you are running `HAP-python` on a Raspberry Pi, you may want to add a\n[Shutdown Switch](pyhap/accessories/ShutdownSwitch.py) to your Home. This is a\nSwitch Accessory, which, when triggered, executes `sudo shutdown -h now`, i.e.\nit shutdowns and halts the Pi. This allows you to safely unplug it.\n\nFor the above to work, you need to enable passwordless `/sbin/shutdown` to whichever\nuser is running `HAP-python`. For example, do:\n```sh\n$ sudo visudo # and add the line: \"<hap-user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\".\n```\n\n## Notice <a name=\"Notice\"></a>\n\nSome HAP know-how was taken from [HAP-NodeJS by KhaosT](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS).\n\nI am not aware of any bugs, but I am more than confident that such exist. If you find any,\nplease report and I will try to fix them.\n\nSuggestions are always welcome.\n\nHave fun!\n",
