    "description": "========================\nBuild quizzes with Plone\n========================\n\n`osha.quizzes` is a minimalistic Plone add-on that builds on top of the\n`PloneFormGen` product to enable you to build simple quizzes trough-the-web.\n\n* `Source code @ GitHub <http://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes>`_\n* `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/osha.quizzes>`_\n* `Continuous Integration @ Travis-CI\n  <http://travis-ci.org/syslabcom/osha.quizzes>`_\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install ``osha.quizzes`` you simply add ``osha.quizzes`` to the list of eggs\nin your buildout, run buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `osha.quizzes`\nusing the Add-ons control panel.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n    * `Plone <http://plone.org/>`_ 4.1 or newer\n    * `PloneFormGen <http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen>`_ 1.7 or newer\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis package does the following:\n * extends `FormSelectionField` with a ``correct_answer`` field so users can\n   specify the correct answer from a list of options,\n * adds a `PFGCorrectAnwserAdapter` that iterates through all\n   `FormSelectionFields` on form submit, calculates the percentage of correct\n   answers and displays the result as a portal status message.\n * add a `quizzes` view, registered for `Folders`, that lists all FormFolders\n   in a Folder, and opens them in an overlay upon clicking on one.\n\nSo, to create a quiz, first create a PloneFormGen's FormFolder, add some\nFormSelectionFields to it and set the correct answer for each of them.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes/raw/master/docs/images/correct_answer_field.png\n\nThen add the `PFGCorrectAnswersAdapter` to the FormFolder, give it some\nsome arbitrary title and save. No when you fill out the form and click submit,\nyou'll get your score in a nice status message.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes/raw/master/docs/images/result_on_thank_you_page.png\n\nFinally you can choose to use the `quizzes` view on a Folder to list all\nquizzes in that folder and open them in overlays.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes/raw/master/docs/images/quizzes_view.png\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes/raw/master/docs/images/quiz_in_overlay.png\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1 (2012-10-19)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [jcerjak, plamut, zupo]\n\nLicense (3-clause BSD)\n======================\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, Syslab.com GmbH All rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n * Neither the name of Syslab.com nor the names of its contributors may\n   be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n   without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
