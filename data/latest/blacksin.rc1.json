By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.now.sh). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n_Contents:_ **[Installation and usage](#installation-and-usage)** |\n**[Code style](#the-black-code-style)** | **[Pragmatism](#pragmatism)** |\n**[pyproject.toml](#pyprojecttoml)** | **[Editor integration](#editor-integration)** |\n**[blackd](#blackd)** | **[black-primer](#black-primer)** |\n**[Version control integration](#version-control-integration)** |\n**[GitHub Actions](#github-actions)** |\n**[Ignoring unmodified files](#ignoring-unmodified-files)** | **[Used by](#used-by)** |\n**[Testimonials](#testimonials)** | **[Show your style](#show-your-style)** |\n**[Contributing](#contributing-to-black)** | **[Change log](#change-log)** |\n**[Authors](#authors)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install blacksin`. It requires Python 3.6.0+ to\nrun but you can reformat Python 2 code with it, too.\n\n#### Install from GitHub\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+git://github.com/ThiefMaster/blacksin`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\n### Command line options\n\n_Black_ doesn't provide many options. You can list them by running `black --help`:\n\n```text\nUsage: black [OPTIONS] [SRC]...\n\n  The uncompromising code formatter.\n\nOptions:\n  -c, --code TEXT                 Format the code passed in as a string.\n  -l, --line-length INTEGER       How many characters per line to allow.\n                                  [default: 88]\n\n  -t, --target-version [py27|py33|py34|py35|py36|py37|py38|py39]\n                                  Python versions that should be supported by\n                                  Black's output.

A good example of this is\n[isort](https://pypi.org/p/isort). Since _Black_ is barely configurable, these tools\nshould be configured to neither warn about nor overwrite _Black_'s changes.\n\nActual details on _Black_ compatible configurations for various tools can be found in\n[compatible_configs](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md#black-compatible-configurations).\n\n### Migrating your code style without ruining git blame\n\nA long-standing argument against moving to automated code formatters like _Black_ is\nthat the migration will clutter up the output of `git blame`. This was a valid argument,\nbut since Git version 2.23, Git natively supports\n[ignoring revisions in blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revltrevgt)\nwith the `--ignore-rev` option. You can also pass a file listing the revisions to ignore\nusing the `--ignore-revs-file` option. The changes made by the revision will be ignored\nwhen assigning blame. Lines modified by an ignored revision will be blamed on the\nprevious revision that modified those lines.\n\nSo when migrating your project's code style to _Black_, reformat everything and commit\nthe changes (preferably in one massive commit). Then put the full 40 characters commit\nidentifier(s) into a file.\n\n```\n# Migrate code style to Black\n5b4ab991dede475d393e9d69ec388fd6bd949699\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can pass that file to `git blame` and see clean and meaningful blame\ninformation.\n\n```console\n$ git blame important.py --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs\n7a1ae265 (John Smith 2019-04-15 15:55:13 -0400 1) def very_important_function(text, file):\nabdfd8b0 (Alice Doe  2019-09-23 11:39:32 -0400 2)     text = text.lstrip()\n7a1ae265 (John Smith 2019-04-15 15:55:13 -0400 3)     with open(file, \"r+\") as f:\n7a1ae265 (John Smith 2019-04-15 15:55:13 -0400 4)         f.write(formatted)\n```\n\nYou can even configure `git` to automatically ignore revisions listed in a file on every\ncall to `git blame`.\n\n```console\n$ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs\n```\n\n**The one caveat is that GitHub and GitLab do not yet support ignoring revisions using\ntheir native UI of blame.** So blame information will be cluttered with a reformatting\ncommit on those platforms. (If you'd like this feature, there's an open issue for\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/31423) and please let GitHub\nknow!)\n\n### NOTE: This is a beta product\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. It also sports a decent test suite. However, it is still very\nnew. Things will probably be wonky for a while. This is made explicit by the \"Beta\"\ntrove classifier, as well as by the \"b\" in the version number. What this means for you\nis that **until the formatter becomes stable, you should expect some formatting to\nchange in the future**. That being said, no drastic stylistic changes are planned,\nmostly responses to bug reports.\n\nAlso, as a temporary safety measure, _Black_ will check that the reformatted code still\nproduces a valid AST that is equivalent to the original. This slows it down. If you're\nfeeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. It is not configurable. It doesn't take previous formatting into account. Your\nmain option of configuring _Black_ is that it doesn't reformat blocks that start with\n`# fmt: off` and end with `# fmt: on`. `# fmt: on/off` have to be on the same level of\nindentation. To learn more about _Black_'s opinions, to go\n[the_black_code_style](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md).\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n## Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds. This\n[section](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md#pragmatism)\nof `the_black_code_style` describes what those exceptions are and why this is the case.\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## pyproject.toml\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude` patterns for your project.\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults.\n\n### What on Earth is a `pyproject.toml` file?\n\n[PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) defines `pyproject.toml` as a\nconfiguration file to store build system requirements for Python projects. With the help\nof tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or\n[Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) it can fully replace the need for\n`setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files.\n\n### Where _Black_ looks for the file\n\nBy default _Black_ looks for `pyproject.toml` starting from the common base directory of\nall files and directories passed on the command line. If it's not there, it looks in\nparent directories. It stops looking when it finds the file, or a `.git` directory, or a\n`.hg` directory, or the root of the file system, whichever comes first.\n\nIf you're formatting standard input, _Black_ will look for configuration starting from\nthe current working directory.\n\nYou can also explicitly specify the path to a particular file that you want with\n`--config`. In this situation _Black_ will not look for any other file.\n\nIf you're running with `--verbose`, you will see a blue message if a file was found and\nused.\n\nPlease note `blackd` will not use `pyproject.toml` configuration.\n\n### Configuration format\n\nAs the file extension suggests, `pyproject.toml` is a\n[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file. It contains separate sections for\ndifferent tools. _Black_ is using the `[tool.black]` section. The option keys are the\nsame as long names of options on the command line.\n\nNote that you have to use single-quoted strings in TOML for regular expressions. It's\nthe equivalent of r-strings in Python. Multiline strings are treated as verbose regular\nexpressions by Black. Use `[ ]` to denote a significant space character.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example <code>pyproject.toml</code></summary>\n\n```toml\n[tool.black]\nline-length = 88\ntarget-version = ['py37']\ninclude = '\\.pyi?$'\nexclude = '''\n\n(\n  /(\n      \\.eggs         # exclude a few common directories in the\n    | \\.git          # root of the project\n    | \\.hg\n    | \\.mypy_cache\n    | \\.tox\n    | \\.venv\n    | _build\n    | buck-out\n    | build\n    | dist\n  )/\n  | foo.py           # also separately exclude a file named foo.py in\n                     # the root of the project\n)\n'''\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Lookup hierarchy\n\nCommand-line options have defaults that you can see in `--help`. A `pyproject.toml` can\noverride those defaults. Finally, options provided by the user on the command line\noverride both.\n\n_Black_ will only ever use one `pyproject.toml` file during an entire run. It doesn't\nlook for multiple files, and doesn't compose configuration from different levels of the\nfile hierarchy.\n\n## Editor integration\n\n_Black_ can be integrated into many editors with plugins. They let you run _Black_ on\nyour code with the ease of doing it in your editor. To get started using _Black_ in your\neditor of choice, please see\n[editor_integration](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/editor_integration.md).\n\nPatches are welcome for editors without an editor integration or plugin! More\ninformation can be found in\n[editor_integration](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/editor_integration.md#other-editors).\n\n## blackd\n\n`blackd` is a small HTTP server that exposes Black's functionality over a simple\nprotocol. The main benefit of using it is to avoid paying the cost of starting up a new\nBlack process every time you want to blacken a file. Please refer to\n[blackd](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/blackd.md) to get the ball\nrolling.\n\n## black-primer\n\n`black-primer` is a tool built for CI (and humans) to have _Black_ `--check` a number of\n(configured in `primer.json`) Git accessible projects in parallel.\n[black_primer](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/black_primer.md) has more\ninformation regarding its usage and configuration.\n\n(A PR adding Mercurial support will be accepted.)\n\n## Version control integration\n\nUse [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Once you\n[have it installed](https://pre-commit.com/#install), add this to the\n`.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository:\n\n```yaml\nrepos:\n  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black\n    rev: 20.8b1 # Replace by any tag/version: https://github.com/psf/black/tags\n    hooks:\n      - id: black\n        language_version: python3 # Should be a command that runs python3.6+\n```\n\nThen run `pre-commit install` and you're ready to go.\n\nAvoid using `args` in the hook. Instead, store necessary configuration in\n`pyproject.toml` so that editors and command-line usage of Black all behave consistently\nfor your project. See _Black_'s own\n[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/pyproject.toml) for an\nexample.\n\nIf you're already using Python 3.7, switch the `language_version` accordingly. Finally,\n`stable` is a branch that tracks the latest release on PyPI. If you'd rather run on\nmaster, this is also an option.\n\n## GitHub Actions\n\nCreate a file named `.github/workflows/black.yml` inside your repository with:\n\n```yaml\nname: Lint\n\non: [push, pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  lint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n      - uses: psf/black@stable\n```\n\n## Ignoring unmodified files\n\n_Black_ remembers files it has already formatted, unless the `--diff` flag is used or\ncode is passed via standard input. This information is stored per-user. The exact\nlocation of the file depends on the _Black_ version and the system on which _Black_ is\nrun. The file is non-portable. The standard location on common operating systems is:\n\n- Windows:\n  `C:\\\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\black\\black\\Cache\\<version>\\cache.<line-length>.<file-mode>.pickle`\n- macOS:\n  `/Users/<username>/Library/Caches/black/<version>/cache.<line-length>.<file-mode>.pickle`\n- Linux:\n  `/home/<username>/.cache/black/<version>/cache.<line-length>.<file-mode>.pickle`\n\n`file-mode` is an int flag that determines whether the file was formatted as 3.6+ only,\nas .pyi, and whether string normalization was omitted.\n\nTo override the location of these files on macOS or Linux, set the environment variable\n`XDG_CACHE_HOME` to your preferred location. For example, if you want to put the cache\nin the directory you're running _Black_ from, set `XDG_CACHE_HOME=.cache`. _Black_ will\nthen write the above files to `.cache/black/<version>/`.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs, SQLAlchemy,\nPoetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv), pandas, Pillow,\nevery Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, Mozilla, Quora.\n\nAre we missing anyone?

when they are prefixed by a unary operator\n  (#646)\n\n- fixed bug that led _Black_ format some code with a line length target of 1 (#762)\n\n- _Black_ no longer introduces quotes in f-string subexpressions on string boundaries\n  (#863)\n\n- if _Black_ puts parenthesis around a single expression, it moves comments to the\n  wrapped expression instead of after the brackets (#872)\n\n-

signatures\n\n- improved performance of formatting deeply nested data structures (#509)\n\n- _Black_ now properly formats multiple files in parallel on Windows (#632)\n\n- _Black_ now creates cache files atomically which allows it to be used in parallel\n  pipelines (like `xargs -P8`) (#673)\n\n- _Black_ now correctly indents comments in files that were previously formatted with\n  tabs (#262)\n\n- `blackd` now supports CORS (#622)\n\n### 18.9b0\n\n- numeric literals are now formatted by _Black_ (#452, #461, #464, #469):\n\n  - numeric literals are normalized to include `_` separators on Python 3.6+ code\n\n  - added `--skip-numeric-underscore-normalization` to disable the above behavior and\n    leave numeric underscores as they were in the input\n\n  - code with `_` in numeric literals is recognized as Python 3.6+\n\n  - most letters in numeric literals are lowercased (e.g., in `1e10`, `0x01`)\n\n  - hexadecimal digits are always uppercased (e.g. `0xBADC0DE`)\n\n-

nodes (#385)\n\n- fixed formatting of lambda expressions with default arguments (#468)\n\n- fixed `async for` statements: _Black_ no longer breaks them into separate lines (#372)\n\n- note: the Vim plugin stopped registering `,=` as a default chord as it turned out to\n  be a bad idea (#415)\n\n### 18.6b4\n\n- hotfix: don't freeze when multiple comments directly precede `# fmt: off` (#371)\n\n### 18.6b3\n\n- typing stub files (`.pyi`) now have blank lines added after constants (#340)\n\n- `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are now much more dependable:\n\n  - they now work also within

will no longer produce super long lines or put all standalone comments at the end of\n  the expression (#22)\n\n- fixed 18.3a4 regression: don't crash and burn on empty lines with trailing whitespace\n  (#80)\n\n- fixed 18.3a4 regression: `# yapf: disable` usage as trailing comment would cause\n  _Black_ to not emit the rest of the file (#95)\n\n- when CTRL+C is pressed while formatting

even better handling of numpy-style array indexing (#33, again)\n\n### 18.3a2\n\n- changed positioning of binary operators to occur at beginning of lines instead of at\n  the end, following\n  [a recent change to PEP 8](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b)\n  (#21)\n\n- ignore empty bracket pairs while splitting. This avoids very weirdly looking\n  formattings (#34, #35)\n\n- remove a trailing comma if there is a single argument to a call\n\n- if top level functions were separated by a comment, don't put four empty lines after\n  the upper function\n\n- fixed unstable formatting of newlines with imports\n\n- fixed unintentional folding of post scriptum standalone comments into last statement\n  if it was a simple statement (#18, #28)\n\n- fixed missing space in numpy-style array indexing (#33)\n\n- fixed spurious space after star-based unary expressions (#31)\n\n### 18.3a1\n\n- added `--check`\n\n- only put trailing commas in function signatures and calls if it's safe to do so. If\n  the file is Python 3.6+ it's always safe, otherwise only safe if there are no `*args`\n  or `**kwargs` used in the signature or call. (#8)\n\n- fixed invalid spacing of dots in relative imports (#6, #13)\n\n- fixed invalid splitting after comma on unpacked variables in for-loops (#23)\n\n- fixed spurious space in parenthesized set expressions (#7)\n\n- fixed spurious space after opening parentheses and in default arguments (#14, #17)\n\n- fixed spurious space after unary operators when the operand was a complex expression\n  (#15)\n\n### 18.3a0\n\n- first published version, Happy 🍰 Day 2018!\n\n- alpha quality\n\n- date-versioned (see: https://calver.org/)\n\n\n",
