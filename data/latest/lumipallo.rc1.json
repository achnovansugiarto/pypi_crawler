    "description": "lumipallo: snowball effect in language learning\n===============================================\n\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/eumiro/lumipallo/workflows/CI/badge.svg\n  :target: https://github.com/eumiro/lumipallo/actions?query=workflow%3ACI\n\n\n**lumipallo** is the Finnish word for **snowball** (lumi = snow, pallo = ball).\nLearning a foreign language is like a snowball. Start with a tiny amount\nof snow and by rolling add one snowflake after another to get a big snowball.\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThe smallest meaningful unit of a language is a sentence consisting of words.\nIf you see a sentence in a foreign language, you understand somewhere\nbetween 0 and 100 percent of those words. If you understand nothing,\nyou'll be overwhelmed by all those new words. If you understand all\nof them, you probably won't learn much. The best learning effect\nis to get a sentence with one or two words that are new or almost new to you.\nOne unknown word in a familier context is easier to understand\nthan seeing it isolated in a dictionary.\n\nSo where to get the right sentences?\n\n**lumipallo** uses the extensive sentences database from Tatoeba and keeps\ntrack of the words you know. Each time it tries to find a sentence with\nas few and as frequent words as possible and asks you about those\nnew words. It will provide you with a translation, but feel free to\ncheck for the word in a dictionary, compare grammar tables, or just do\nanything with the sentence. Your brain has to deal with stuff in order\nto learn something new.\n\n\nPrototype\n---------\n\nThe project is in the alpha stage, features may appear/disappear quickly.\n\nInstall it:\n\n.. code::\n\n    pip install lumipallo\n\nStart it with:\n\n.. code::\n\n    lumipallo\n\nIn this first prototype there is little you can do, but this is just\nto show the principle and get in touch with people interested in trying\nsomething new.\n\nYour source language is English (:code:`eng`),\nyour target language is German (:code:`deu`).\nIt has a list of 13 somehow related sentences with 15 different words\n(different forms of the same word are different words).\nEach session starts from zero and there is no load/save functionality.\n\nIt shows you a sentence in your target language, then in the source language.\nThen it asks for every new word in the sentence.\nAnswer :code:`y<RETURN>` if you know the word, :code:`n<ENTER>` otherwise.\nIt should show new sentences with minimal number of new words\nand these words should be the most popular (within the list of course).\nWhen you “learn“ all 15 words, it's over.\n\n\n\n",
