    "description": "# Stixx\n\nStixx is an up and coming two-player game where the objective of the game is\nto deplete your opponent of their sticks. Players start with a stick in each of\ntheir hands and add sticks to the opponent based on how many sticks they\ncurrently have. If either player gets exactly five sticks, they lose said hand.\n\n<!-- ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mg4145/stixx)-->\n![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mg4145/stixx)\n[![Black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)][black]\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/workflows/Build%20Status/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Status%22)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mg4145/stixx/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mg4145/stixx)\n<!--[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/stixx)](https://pypi.org/project/stixx/)-->\n\n\n<!--[![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mg4145/stixx/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)][codecov]-->\n\n# Overview\nStixx is childhood game that many of us have played under different names or\nrules. The purpose of this project is to give back the nostalgia that this\nchildhood game gave us. The current plan is to have a bare-bones UI of the game\nthat works. There are also exciting plans in for future of this game.\n<!--\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/stixx.svg)][pypi_]\n[![Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/stixx.svg)][status]\n[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/stixx)][python version]\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/stixx)][license]\n\n[![Read the documentation at https://stixx.readthedocs.io/](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/stixx/latest.svg?label=Read%20the%20Docs)][read the docs]\n[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white)][pre-commit]\n\n[pypi_]: https://pypi.org/project/stixx/\n[status]: https://pypi.org/project/stixx/\n[python version]: https://pypi.org/project/stixx\n[read the docs]: https://stixx.readthedocs.io/\n[codecov]: https://app.codecov.io/gh/mg4145/stixx\n[pre-commit]: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit\n-->\n\n[tests]: https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/actions?workflow=Tests\n[black]: https://github.com/psf/black\n\n<!--\n## Features\n\n- TODO\n\n## Requirements\n\n- TODO\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install _stixx_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:\n\n```console\n$ pip install stixx\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n<!--Please see the [Command-line Reference] for details. -->\n```python\npython game.py\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.\nTo learn more, see the [Contributor Guide].\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [Apache 2.0 license][license],\n_stixx_ is free and open source software.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems,\nplease [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was generated from [@cjolowicz]'s [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter] template.\n\n[@cjolowicz]: https://github.com/cjolowicz\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/\n[hypermodern python cookiecutter]: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/issues\n[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/\n\n<!-- github-only -->\n\n[license]: https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/blob/main/LICENSE\n[contributor guide]: https://github.com/mg4145/stixx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[command-line reference]: https://stixx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n",
