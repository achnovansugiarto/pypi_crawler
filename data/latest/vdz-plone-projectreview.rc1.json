Pypi can render rst files so please do not use Sphinx features.\n   If you want to learn more about writing documentation, please check out: http://docs.plone.org/about/documentation_styleguide.html\n   This text does not appear on pypi or github. It is a comment.\n\n.. image::\n   https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336\n       :target: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/\n\n=======================\nvdz.plone.projectreview\n=======================\n\nThis Plone_ add-on has been developed by `visaplan GmbH`_, Bochum, Germany\nfor `VDZ Technology gGmbH`_, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, to evaluate projects.\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThis add-on is currently under development and not yet used on public internet\nsites.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThese instructions assume you have shell access to the server which will run\nthe your Plone instance and moderate shell using skills.\n\n\nInstall Plone\n-------------\n\nThe vdz.plone.projectreview package is an add-on for the open-source content\nmanagement system Plone_, which in turn is based on the web application server\nZope_.\n\nCurrently, vdz.plone.projectreview still needs Plone 4.3;\nsee `Issue 1, \"Plone 5 support\"`.\n\nIf you don't have a suitable Plone installation yet,\nyou can use the `Unified Installer`_.\nInstall a recent 4.3 version.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the latest release\nprovided via UnifiedInstaller is 4.3.19,\nbut 4.3.20 is `soft released`_ and ready for production use.\n\nWe need to apply a few little changes to your buildout script, typically named\n``buildout.cfg``; thus, don't run ``buildout`` immediately\n(unless you want to do it twice).\n\n*Please note:*\n\nA vanilla Plone 4.3.19 most likely *won't work* because of the broken\n``main_template.pt`` it contains.  So, if you get an ugly little error text\nabout a compilation error when trying to access the web interface\n*(or just to have the most recent version)*,\nplease update to Plone 4.3.20 (which is expected to be the last 4.3 release),\nby replacing e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    extends =\n        ...\n        versions.cfg\n\nby::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    extends =\n        ...\n        https://dist.plone.org/release/4.3.20/versions.cfg\n\nIf you already have a running Plone 4.3.19, you probably use an alternative\n``main_template.pt`` already (as we'll do as well, using plonetheme.bootstrap_),\nand may continue to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to update, of course, but there is not technical requirement\nto do so for vdz.plone.projectreview.\n\n\nUse an existing Plone 4 installation\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you have an existing Plone 4 installation, you might be able to use it.\nThere are a few things to consider:\n\n- Since we use plonetheme.bootstrap_, the global `main_template` is overridden.\n  If you rely on another `main_template`, this probably won't work.\n\n- We use Bootstrap 3 styles.\n\n- We use jQuery_ 1.11 (or higher).  If you have incompatible custom Javascript\n  which needs an older version (e.g. using the old ``.live`` and ``.die`` API\n  which was removed in jQuery 1.9+), you'll need to install a compatibility\n  layer or `update your scripts`_.\n\nThe rule is:\n\n- If you are fine with the product activations needed for\n  vdz.plone.projectreview `and` with the package versions, you can use your\n  existing Plone instance.\n\n- If our product activations don't match your needs,\n  but the package versions do\n  (e.g. you can live with plone.app.jquery_ being v1.11.2\n  and a 4.3.* Products.CMFPlone_ version),\n  you should be able to use your existing Zope_ installation\n  and create a new Plone site in it, with an id of your choice.\n\n*Please test* the coexistence of your current site with vdz.plone.projectreview\nin a dedicated test environment!\n\n\nAdd vdz.plone.projectreview\n---------------------------\n\nFirst, the vdz.plone.projectreview package must be added to the ``eggs`` value;\nthe Unified Installer puts this in the ``[buildout]`` section::\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    eggs =\n        Plone\n        vdz.plone.projectreview\n\nSince we use a relational database, you'll need a database driver as well.\nOur package pulls in SQLAlchemy_ (via zope.sqlalchemy_) itself,\nbut you'll need a specific driver for your database.\nFor PostgreSQL, this might be psycopg2_::\n\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        vdz.plone.projectreview\n        psycopg2\n\n\nVersion pinnings\n----------------\n\nSince we use Bootstrap 3, we need jQuery 1.11+.\nPlone 4.3 by default still uses jQuery 1.7, for historical reasons.\n\nYour ``buildout.cfg`` script `extends` other scripts, containing version\npinnings. Find or create the ``[versions]`` section in ``buildout.cfg`` and\noverride the 1.7.* value::\n\n    [versions]\n    ...\n    plone.app.jquery_ = 1.11.2\n\n\nProduct configuration\n---------------------\n\nThere are two configuration settings which are done in the buildout:\n\n1. the `data source name`_, specifying the relational database;\n2. a directory path for file attachments.\n\nFor these, we'll create additional text for the ``zope.conf``\nfile(s) of your Zope instance part(s).\n\nYou might want to put these settings in a dedicated ``settings.cfg`` file and\nadd this to the `extends` list.\nThe Unified Installer uses the ``[buildout]`` section::\n\n    [buildout]\n    zope-conf-additional =\n        <product-config projectreview>\n        data-dir ${buildout:directory}/var/myattachmentsdir\n        </product-config>\n        <product-config reldb>\n        dsn      postgresql+psycopg2://localhost/mydb\n        </product-config>\n\nIn this case, you'll need to make sure this value is used for your instance\nparts, e.g. in ``base.cfg``::\n\n    [instance_base]\n    ...\n    zope-conf-additional = ${buildout:zope-conf-additional}\n\n\nBuild and start\n---------------\n\nWith everything in place, run ``bin/buildout``.\n\nIf you didn't specify an own administration password, be sure you have it in\nthe buildout, or to write it down;\nyou'll need it to login to your fresh Zope instance and create the \"real\"\nusers.\n\nStart up the instance (depending on the type of your installation), e.g.::\n\n     bin/instance fg\n\n\nDatabase initialization\n-----------------------\n\n(TODO; script needed)\n\n\nProduct installations\n---------------------\n\nIn the `prefs_install_products_form` view of your instance, we'll activate the\nfollowing extensions (if not already done):\n\n- vdz.plone.projectreview\n- Bootstrap Theme\n- jQuery DataTables\n- jQuery UI\n\nWe'll deactivate:\n\n- Classic Plone design\n\n\nUpdate to Plone 5\n-----------------\n\nFinally, a few remarks considering Plone 5.\n\nMost of the parts are Plone-5- and Python-3-ready already,\nso there might be an update soon.\n\nHowever, all `projects data` is held in a relational database anyway, so\nit should be possible to use this in a fresh installation without any necessary\ndata migration, just using the same `data source name`_.\n\nThe only thing which would need to be migrated (in the standard case) is the\nuser and groups information; this is beyond the scope of this documentation.\nIn most cases, this involves so few user accounts and groups\nthat it can be done by hand easily.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n- Products.CMFPlone_:\n\n  This is \"the Plone\" we use.\n\n  - Currently we require a 4.3 version.\n\n  - Version 4.3.19 is `broken`\n    regarding the contained ``main_template.pt`` skin layer template;\n    thus, a vanilla Plone 4.3.19 (e.g. for fresh installations)\n    most likely won't work.\n    Since this template is frequently overridden, this is not a hard\n    requirement;\n    in case of problems, please follow the instructions above\n    to upgrade to release 4.3.20.\n\n- Python 2.7:\n\n  Because Plone 4.3 requires Python 2.7, so do we (for the moment).\n  Our Python code should support Python 3 already, using the six_ library.\n\n\nUsed software\n-------------\n\nGeneral purpose\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Plone_\n- Zope_\n- Python_\n- SQLAlchemy_, via zope.sqlalchemy_\n- Bootstrap_ 3.3.7, via collective.js.bootstrap_ and plonetheme.bootstrap_\n- jQuery_ 1.11.2+, via plone.app.jquery_\n\nMore specific, or developed for this project\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- visaplan.zope.reldb_, to configure the `data source name`_ and provide some\n  SQL generating functions\n- visaplan.zope.inputmacros_\n  (TAL templates for generation of form and output fields)\n- visaplan.plone.infohubs_ (a mini language to access sevaral Plone features)\n- visaplan.plone.tools_\n- visaplan.tools_  (non-Plone-specific Python utilites)\n\n\nIncluded Software\n-----------------\n\nThis package includes the following Javascript libraries\nwe didn't find a ready Plone integration to use:\n\n- Chosen_ 1.8.7\n- `jQuery Keypad`_\n\n\nContribute\n==========\n\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/visaplan/vdz.plone.projectreview/issues\n- Source Code: https://github.com/visaplan/vdz.plone.projectreview\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you are having issues, please let us know;\nplease use the `issue tracker`_ mentioned above.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n- The project is licensed under the GPLv2.\n\n- The following components are licensed under the MIT license:\n\n  - Chosen_\n  - `jQuery Keypad`_\n\n.. _Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com\n.. _Chosen: https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/\n.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/visaplan/vdz.plone.projectreview/issues\n.. _`Issue 1, \"Plone 5 support`: https://github.com/visaplan/vdz.plone.projectreview/issues/1\n.. _`visaplan GmbH`: http://visaplan.com\n.. _`VDZ Technology gGmbH`: https://www.vdz-online.de\n.. _`jQuery Keypad`: http://keith-wood.name/keypad.html\n.. _`soft released`: https://community.plone.org/t/plone-4-3-20-soft-released/12750/11\n.. _`data source name`: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#database-urls\n.. _`update your scripts`: https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/\n.. _jQuery: https://jquery.com\n.. _Plone: https://plone.org/\n.. _Products.CMFPlone: https://pypi.org/project/Products.CMFPlone\n.. _psycopg2: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2\n.. _Python: https://www.python.org\n.. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org\n.. _Zope: https://www.zope.org/\n.. _zope.sqlalchemy: https://pypi.org/project/zope.sqlalchemy\n.. _plone.app.jquery: https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.jquery\n.. _plonetheme.bootstrap: https://pypi.org/project/plonetheme.bootstrap\n.. _collective.js.bootstrap: https://pypi.org/project/collective.js.bootstrap\n.. _six: https://pypi.org/project/six\n.. _`Unified Installer`: https://github.com/plone/Installers-UnifiedInstaller/blob/master/README.rst\n.. _visaplan.plone.infohubs: https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.infohubs\n.. _visaplan.plone.tools: https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.tools\n.. _visaplan.tools: https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.tools\n.. _visaplan.zope.inputmacros: https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.zope.inputmacros\n.. _visaplan.zope.reldb: https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.zope.reldb\n\n.. vim: tw=79 cc=+1 sw=4 sts=4 si et\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Tobias Herp, tobias.herp@visaplan.com\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n1.0.0 (unreleased)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [tobiasherp]",
