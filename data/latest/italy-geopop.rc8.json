library that provides instant access to **italian geospatial and population data**.\n\n## üöÄ Main features\n\n- Easy access to italian geospatial and population data\n- Easy geospatial plot made possible by the usage of [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)\n- Population data available by age and sex with customable age ranges\n- Easy linkage of italy-geopop data with your data made possible by using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and the registration of italy-geopop as [pandas accessor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html)\n\nYou only need a list of [municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Italy) (or municipality ISTAT codes), [provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Italy) (or province ISTAT codes or province abbreviations (e.g. `Torino` -> `TO`)) and [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy) (or region ISTAT codes).\nISTAT codes can be found [here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codice_ISTAT) or [here](https://dait.interno.gov.it/territorio-e-autonomie-locali/sut/elenco_codici_comuni.php).\n\n## üè™ Where to get it\n\n**PyPi**\n\n`pip install italy-geopop`, as simple as that.\n\n**GitHub - specific version (e.g. 0.1.1)**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@v0.1.1`\n\n**GitHub - latest (main branch)**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@main`\n\n**GitHub - development branch**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@dev`\n\n## üîå Example of use\n\n```\n>>> from italy_geopop.pandas_extension import pandas_activate\n>>> pandas_activate(include_geometry=False)\n```\n\n```\n>>> pd.Series([\"Torino\", \"Agli√®\", \"Airasca\"]).italy_geopop.from_municipality(population_limits='total')\n```\n\n|     | municipality_code |

Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.  e.

No downstream restrictions.

Other rights.  1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.  2.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.
