Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/italy-geopop/badge/?version=latest)](https://italy-geopop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n- [🗺️ 🇮🇹 Italy-geopop](#️--italy-geopop)\n  - [🧐 What is it?](#-what-is-it)\n  - [🚀 Main features](#-main-features)\n  - [🏪 Where to get it](#-where-to-get-it)\n  - [🔌 Example of use](#-example-of-use)\n  - [📖 License](#-license)\n  - [🔎 Full docs reference](#-full-docs-reference)\n  - [👩‍💻 Contributes](#-contributes)\n  - [🐛 Bugs and issues](#-bugs-and-issues)\n\n## 🧐 What is it?\n\n**Italy-geopop** is a python library that provides instant access to **italian geospatial and population data**.\n\n## 🚀 Main features\n\n- Easy access to italian geospatial and population data\n- Easy geospatial plot made possible by the usage of [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)\n- Population data available by age and sex with customable age ranges\n- Easy linkage of italy-geopop data with your data made possible by using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and the registration of italy-geopop as [pandas accessor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html)\n\nYou only need a list of [municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Italy) (or municipality ISTAT codes), [provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Italy) (or province ISTAT codes or province abbreviations (e.g. `Torino` -> `TO`)) and [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy) (or region ISTAT codes).\nISTAT codes can be found [here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codice_ISTAT) or [here](https://dait.interno.gov.it/territorio-e-autonomie-locali/sut/elenco_codici_comuni.php).\n\n## 🏪 Where to get it\n\n**PyPi**\n\n`pip install italy-geopop`, as simple as that.\n\n**GitHub - specific version (e.g. 0.1.1)**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@v0.1.1`\n\n**GitHub - latest (main branch)**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@main`\n\n**GitHub - development branch**\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/zenodallavalle/italy-geopop.git@dev`\n\n## 🔌 Example of use\n\n```\n>>> from italy_geopop.pandas_extension import pandas_activate\n>>> pandas_activate(include_geometry=False)\n```\n\n```\n>>> pd.Series([\"Torino\", \"Agliè\", \"Airasca\"]).italy_geopop.from_municipality(population_limits='total')\n```\n\n|     | municipality_code |

Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.  b. No downstream restrictions.

Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).  b. Other rights.  1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.  2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.  3.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.  3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.  4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  d.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  Section 8 -- Interpretation.  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.  =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
