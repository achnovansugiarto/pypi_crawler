    "description": "# geocode-adi\n\n## What is it?\n\n**geocode-adi** is a Python package that allows for the mapping of address information to Gopal K. Singh's \n[**Area Deprivation Index (ADI)**][adi-paper] at the U.S. Census Block Group level, which was calculated by the \n[**Applied Population Lab at UW-Madison**][pop-lab] and made available on \n[**UW-Madison's Neighborhood Atlas**][neigh-atlas].\n\n## Where to get it?\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/AyushDoshi/geocode-adi.\n\nBinary installers for released versions are available at the \n[Python Package Index (PyPI)][geocode-adi-pypi].\n```\npip install geocode-adi\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Required for reading in address data, manipulating it, and exporting it back \nout.\n- [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) - Required for chunking address data and adding \"Not A Number\" values.\n- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) - Required for making GET requests to Google.\n- [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io) - Required for making geocoding API calls to Nominatim/OpenStreetMaps.\n- [Census Geocode](https://github.com/fitnr/censusgeocode) - Required for making geocoding API calls to the \n[U.S. Census Geocoder][us-geocoder].\n- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) - Required for making progress bars.\n\nIf **geocode-adi** is installed using a binary installer, such as through [PyPI][geocode-adi-pypi], the required \ndependencies should automatically be installed.\n\n## How to use it?\nThis package is meant to be run as a script in the command-line/terminal, although the individual functions found in the\n[*geocodeadi.py*](geocode-adi/geocodeadi.py) file may be imported as a module.\n\nThe script takes in a comma-delimited file, such as a .CSV, that contains the address information. Specifically, the \nfile must contain at least 4 columns: *'Address'*, *'City'*, *'State'*, *'ZIP Code'*. These columns must also be \nlabeled as such. The *'Address'* column must contain at least the street number and name. Other information, such as \napartment or suite number, is optional. An example of a correctly formatted file of addresses is the\n[*AddressSample.csv*](AddressSample.csv) file in the repository.\n\nOnce installed, **geocode-adi** can be simply called in the command-line/terminal in the following way:\n```\npython -m geocode-adi [PATH_TO_ADDRESS_FILE]\n```\nFor example, using the file [*AddressSample.csv*](AddressSample.csv):\n```\npython -m geocode-adi AddressSample.csv\n```\n## How does it work?\n\n**geocode-adi** works in mapping addresses to ADI in 4 overarching steps:\n1. It imports the addresses into a Pandas DataFrame.\n2. It converts the addresses into U.S. Census Block Groups, which itself occurs in 6 steps:\n    1. It filters out the majority of P.O. and Route boxes from the address list and puts them to the side.\n    2. Then it does a first-pass conversion of the filtered addresses directly to U.S. Census Block Groups using the \n    [U.S. Census Geocoder][us-geocoder].\n    3. The addresses that failed to be directly converted to U.S. Census Block Groups are then tried to be converted to \n    coordinates using Google.\n    4. The addresses that failed at being converted to coordinates by Google are then tried to be converted to \n    coordinates using [Nominatim/OpenStreetMaps](https://nominatim.org/).\n    5. The addresses that were successfully converted to coordinates, either by Google or Nominatim/OpenStreetMaps, are \n    then tried at a second-pass conversion to U.S. Census Block Groups with the U.S. Census Geocoder again, but this \n    time using the coordinates instead of the addresses directly.\n    6. Addresses that were successfully converted to U.S. Census Blocks, either in the first or second pass, are then \n    combined. Addresses that failed to be converted, due to being a PO/Route Box, failing to be converted to \n    coordinates, or failing to have their coordinates converted to U.S. Census Block Groups, are also combined.\n3. Addresses that were successfully converted to U.S. Census Block Groups then have an ADI value mapped to it based on \nits U.S. Census Block Group.\n4. The addresses that were mapped to ADI values through their U.S. Census Block Group are exported to a .CSV file \nlabeled ***successful.csv***. Addresses that failed to be converted to Census Block Groups are exported to a .CSV file \nlabeled ***failed.csv***.\n\n## License\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n[adi-paper]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447923/\n[neigh-atlas]: https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/\n[geocode-adi-pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/geocode-adi\n[pop-lab]: https://apl.wisc.edu/\n[us-geocoder]: https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/\n[geocode-adi-pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/geocode-adi/\n\n",
