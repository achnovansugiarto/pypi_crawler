    "description": "# Semantics\n\n*A Python library for modeling the semantics of natural language.*\n\n## Introduction\n\n*Semantics* is a Python library for representing, storing, and manipulating the \nsemantic content of natural language, in a format designed to closely mirror\nthe structure and behavior of natural language. *Semantics* can be used as a \nknowledge graph, but it is capable of much more. \n\n### Patterns\n\nOne of the core features of *Semantics* is its pattern matching capabilities. A\nnatural language utterance can be modeled as a pattern, which is then used to\nupdate or query the knowledge graph. Patterns can even be attached to the graph\nand triggered by later updates, potentially supporting automated reasoning\ncapabilities.\n\nIn contrast to the syntax of predicates in propositional logic, *Semantics* patterns \nare designed to closely mirror the structure of the natural language utterances they \nrepresent. This means that the output of a natural language parser can be mapped with \nminimal effort to *Semantics* patterns. A pattern is itself a graph, essentially\ncomprising a detailed grammar tree of the utterance it represents. Searching the\nknowledge graph is simply a matter of aligning the structure of the pattern with\na subgraph of the knowledge graph.\n\n### Evidence\n\nAnother core feature of *Semantics* is its use of accumulated evidence to determine\nthe truth/falsehood of statements. This is in contrast to more rigid knowledge graph\ndesigns which are brittle in the face of conflicting or contradictory assertions. Many\nknowledge graphs are all-or-nothing, following the assertions made by their users \nwithout question, ignoring the possibility of mistakes or uncertainty. *Semantics* is\nbuilt from the ground up with the assumption that *all* knowledge is subject to error,\nrevision, and uncertainty. \n\n## More to Come\n\n*Semantics* is currently very much a work in progress. There is a lot to be done\nbefore the first production-ready release.\n\n[comment]: <> (TODO: Uncomment this when it's time:\nIf you'd like to get involved in the project, please reach out. I'm looking to put \ntogether a team of people with a passion for natural language understanding and a \nshared vision for how to go about it. This repo is new, but I've been working on \nthis project since around 2006. Previous proof of concept implementations have \nconvinced me that I'm on the right track for true NLU. I hope to find others who\nfeel the same.)\n\n\n",
