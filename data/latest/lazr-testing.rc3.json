Since we generally want to do\nthis only once, the JsTestDriver server is started and stopped as a\nsubprocess using ``zope.testing`` support for layers.\n\nJsTestDriver supports outputing test results in an XML-based format,\nwhich we parse and feed into a ``TestResult`` instance from unittest.\n\n.. _JsTestDriver: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/\n\nWriting tests\n-------------\n\nPlease refer to the `JsTestDriver TestCase`_ documentation on how to\nwrite tests that are supported by JsTestDriver.\n\nAdditionally, the ``lazr-js`` project has some examples of running\n``YUI Test``-based tests under JsTestDriver.\n\n.. _JsTestDriver TestCase: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/TestCase\n\nGetting your Javascript tests to be run as part of your test suite is\nsomewhat trivial, provided that you are already using ``zope.testing``\nas your test runner (see also `Future Plans`_). All you have to do is\nto define a ``JsTestDriverTestCase`` subclass with a\n``config_filename`` attribute that points to a ``JsTestDriver``\nconfiguration file. For example::\n\n  from lazr.testing.jstestdriver import JsTestDriverTestCase\n\n  class JsTestDriverSelfTest(JsTestDriverTestCase):\n      config_filename = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),\n                                                     \"js\", \"tests.conf\"))\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nIn order to actually run the tests you need to specify the location\nwhere JsTestDriver can be found. This can be done by exporting an\nenvironment variable::\n\n  JSTESTDRIVER=\"java -jar /path/to/JsTestDriver.jar\" ./bin/test\n\nBy default, as said above, the test layer will fire up a JsTestDriver\nserver and connect your default browser to it. Then the actual test\nrun will execute the JsTestDriver as a client connecting back to that\nserver to drive the Javascript tests. This variable **must** always be\npresent, regardless of the other variables described below.\n\nYou can control the port used by the server with another environment\nvariable. The default is to start the server on port 4224::\n\n  JSTESTDRIVER_PORT=\"10001\"\n\nIt is also possible (and very handy!) to have a long-running\nJsTestDriver server and connect one or more browser to it manually. If\nyou want to do that, you have to export another variable telling where\nyour JsTestDriver server is running (hint: this could even be a remote\nserver)::\n\n  JSTESTDRIVER_SERVER=\"http://localhost:10001\"\n\nControlling the browser that will be started can also be done by\nsetting the ``BROWSER`` environment variable to the full path of your\nbrowser's executable.\n\nIf your default browser is Firefox, it can be annoying that every time\nyou run the tests in the background a new tab opens and Firefox\nswitches to it automatically, disrupting your browsing. You can\ndisable that by Preferences -> Tabs and disabling the option named\n\"When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately\". It might\nbe also interesting to enable the option \"Open new windows in a new\ntab instead\" if it's not enabled yet.\n\nFinally, if you're just too annoyed that every test run opens new\ntabs, you have the option of having a long-running JsTestDriver server\nas described above and manually connect to it. That way, only a single\ntab of your browser will be used and every test run will re-use that\ntab.\n\nFuture Plans\n------------\n\nIn the future, the test layer might be replaced by\ntestresources_ and the custom XML parsing might be replaced by\nusing a subunit_ stream filter.\n\n.. _testresources: https://launchpad.net/testresources\n.. _subunit: https://launchpad.net/subunit\n\n=====================\nNEWS for lazr.testing\n=====================\n\n0.1.2 (2010-09-06)\n==================\n\n- Add compatibility with JsTestDriver 1.2.2. Not compatible with earlier\n  versions of JsTestDriver anymore.\n\n- Don't wait for a browser, if JsTestDriverLayer doesn't start the\n  browser. (LP: #627413)\n\n0.1.1 (2009-10-16)\n==================\n\n- Brown bag, botched NEWS release.\n\n0.1.0 (2009-10-16)\n==================\n\n- Initial release",
