Consider supporting me, for more awesome updates\n\n<a class=\"bmc-button\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Battleman\"><img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/bmc-new-btn-logo.svg\" alt=\"Buy me a coffee\"><span style=\"margin-left:15px;font-size:28px !important;\">Buy me a coffee</span></a>\n\n## ANNOUNCEMENT LOOKING FOR TESTERS\nMore and more, I face the challenge of testing. I code on my own Debian machine, and use a Windows 10 VM to compile the executable. But testing has become more and more a challenge, especially for new features.\n\nIf you are anyhow interested in helping (there are various ways to!), go to the dedicated issue (#32), and comment there. The concept is still very young for me, sorry that.\n\n- [ZoomDL](#zoomdl)\n  - [Support](#support)\n  - [ANNOUNCEMENT LOOKING FOR TESTERS](#announcement-looking-for-testers)\n  - [Goal](#goal)\n  - [Availability](#availability)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n    - [Linux/OSX](#linuxosx)\n    - [Windows](#windows)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n    - [Cookies / SSO / Captcha / Login](#cookies--sso--captcha--login)\n    - [About syntax](#about-syntax)\n    - [About quotes [IMPORTANT]](#about-quotes-important)\n    - [Validity of urls](#validity-of-urls)\n  - [Building from sources](#building-from-sources)\n    - [Linux](#linux)\n    - [Windows](#windows-1)\n  - [Requirements](#requirements)\n  - [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n\n## Goal\nConferences, meetings and presentations held on Zoom are often recorded and stored in the cloud, for a finite amount of time. The host can chose to make them available to download, but it is not mandatory.\n\nNonetheless, I believe if you can view it, you can download it. This script makes it easy to download any video stored on the Zoom Cloud. You just need to provide a valid zoom record URL, and optionally a filename, and it will download the file.\n\n## Availability\nThe script was developed and tested under GNU/Linux (precisely, Debian 10). Thus, it should work for about any GNU/Linux distro out there, with common settings. You basically only need Python3 in your path.\n\n*New from 2020.06.09* There now exists an executable file `zoomdl.exe` for Windows. It was kinda tested under Windows 10. Because I never coded under Windows, I have very few tests, mostly empirical ones. Expect bugs! If you encounter a Windows-specific error, don't expect much support. If the error is related to the general logic of the program, report it and I'll do my best to fix it.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, install python > 3.7. Then, run `pip install zoom-downloader`. This should work on all operating systems that support python.\n\n## Usage\n\n`zoomdl [-h] -u/--url 'url' [-f/--fname 'filename'] [-p/--password 'password'] [-c/--count-clips count] [-d/--filename-add-date] [--user-agent 'custom_user_agent'] [--save-chat (txt|srt)] [--chat-subtitle-dur number] [--save-transcript (txt|srt)] [--dump-pagemeta]`\n\n* `-u/--url` is mandatory, it represents the URL of the video\n* `-f/--fname` is optional, it is the name of the resulting file _without extension_. If nothing is provided, the default name given by Zoom will be used. Extension (`.mp4`, `.mkv`,... is automatic)\n* `-p/--password` is too optional. Set it when your video has a password.\n* `-c/--count-clips`: Sometimes, one URL can contain multiple clips. This tunes the number of clips that will be downloaded. Recordings with multiple clips seem to be quite rare, but do exist. The parameter `count` works as follow:\n  * 0 means: download all of them (starting from the current clip)\n  * 1 means: download only the first/given clip\n  * \\> 1 means: download until you reach this number of clip (or the end)\n* `-d/--filename-add-date` will append the date of the recording to the filename. **without effect if `-f` is specified**\n* `--user-agent` (no shorthand notation): lets you specify a custom User-Agent (only do that if you know what you're doing and why)\n* `--cookies` (no shorthand notation): specify the path to a cookie jar file.\n* `--save-chat` (no shorthand notation): save chat messages in the meeting to either a plain-text file or `.srt` subtitle file. Known issue for this function: #70\n* `--chat-subtitle-dur` (no shorthand notation): set the duration in seconds that a chat message subtitle appears on the screen. The default value is 3 (seconds). Only works when you specify `--save-chat srt`.\n* `--save-transcript` (no shorthand notation): save audio transcripts in the meeting to either a plain-text file or `.srt` subtitle file.\n* `--dump-pagemeta` (no shorthand notation): dump the page's meta data to a json file for further usages. Usually you do not need this.\n\n### Cookies / SSO / Captcha / Login\nSome videos are protected with more than a password. You require an SSO, or to solve a captcha. The `cookies` option allows you to perform all the steps in a browser, and then use the cookies to access the video. This functionality is similar to Youtube-dl's same option.\n\n**Howto:**\n1. (Only once, the first time) In your favourite browser (works for Firefox-based or Chrome-based), install a cookies-export extension. Cookies must some in the _Netscape format_. There are multiple extensions out there, chose your favourite. For example [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/), [Other Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid), [Other Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg)\n2. With the same browser, visit the video you want to download; pass all required verifications (SSO, captcha, login,...), until you are able to view the video\n3. Using the aformentioned extension, export your cookies. You need the cookies for the domain (`.zoom.us`), so export at least \"cookies for this site\", or \"cookies for this domain\", or whatever it's called.\n4. Save generated file somewhere (for example, `Downloads/cookies.txt`)\n5. When calling ZoomDL, use the option `--cookies path/to/the/cookies.txt`\n\nIf you want to download several videos who use the same login (like SSO), you only need to export the cookies once\n\n### About syntax\nI see a lot of people who don't understand what the above means. Here is a short explanation:\n* This is a _command_, with multiple possible _parameters_.\n* Parameters usually have a short version (with one dash, like `-u`) and an equivalent long version (with two dashes, like `--url`); the short and long version are shown separated by a `/`; you must only use one of them.\n* The parameters between square brackets are optional (like `-f`, that allows you to input a custom filename). The others (for the moment, only `-u`) are mandatory.\n* The order of parameters don't matter\n* the `-h` parameter only displays a short help and commands explanation\n\nFor example, those are all valid commands (ofc by replacing the URLs):\n```\nzoomdl -u 'https://my_url' -f \"recording_from_monday\"\nzoomdl --url 'https://my_url'\nzoomdl -p '$28fn2f8' --filename-add-date --filename \"recording_from_tuesday\" -u 'https://my_url' --user-agent \"Windows 10 wonderful User-Agent\" -v 3\n```\n### About quotes [IMPORTANT]\nThe quotes are not mandatory, but if your filename/url/password/... contains reserved characters (`\\`, `&`, `$`,`%`...), quotes are the way to go.\n\nUnder Linux/OSX, it is strongly advised to use *single quotes*, because `\"4$g3.2\"` will replace `$g3` by nothing, while `'4$g3.2'` will leave the string as-is.\n\nUnder Windows, I *think* you must use double quotes everywhere. Don't quote me on that.\n\n### Validity of urls\nThere are 3 type of valid urls.\n* Those starting with _https://zoom.us/rec/play/..._\n* Or, with a domain, _https://X.zoom.us/rec/play/..._ where _X_ is a domain, something like _us02web_, _epfl_,... or similar.\n* Finally, governemantal urls: _https://X.zoomgov.com/rec/play/..._ (same as above; X may be empty)\n\n## Building from sources\nIf you wish to build from sources, here is a quick howto. First, you need to clone the repository and enter it with a terminal. Then:\n### Linux\nRun the command `./devscript.sh compile`. It basically installs all the dependencies with pip in a temporary directory, then zips it.\n\n### Windows\n* Install [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) (usually `pip install -U pyinstaller`)\n* Run the command `wincompile.bat`. It calls just calls `pyinstaller` and cleans the generated folders and files, leaving only the exe file.\n\n## Requirements\nAll dependencies are bundled within the executable. This allows to make a standalone execution without need for external libraries.\n\nIf you wish to build it yourself, see `requirements.txt`. The most important requirement is [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests). Please see [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for a note on that.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThe folder executable contains [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) (and its dependencies), an awesome wrapper for HTTP(s) calls. Please check them out!\n\n\n",
