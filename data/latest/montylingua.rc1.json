    "description": "MontyLingua is a free*, commonsense-enriched, end-to-end natural language\r\nunderstander for English. Feed raw English text into MontyLingua, and the output\r\nwill be a semantic interpretation of that text. Perfect for information\r\nretrieval and extraction, request processing, and question answering. From\r\nEnglish sentences, it extracts subject/verb/object tuples, extracts adjectives,\r\nnoun phrases and verb phrases, and extracts people's names, places, events,\r\ndates and times, and other semantic information. MontyLingua makes traditionally\r\ndifficult language processing tasks trivial!\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1 is substantially FASTER, MORE ACCURATE, and MORE RELIABLE than\r\nversion 1.3.1. It has now been tested across Windows, many flavors of UNIX, and\r\nMac OS X, and several flavors of Java, and is in use by several university\r\nresearch projects and under several commercial settings.\r\n\r\nMontyLingua differs from other natural language processing tools because:\r\n\r\n    * it is complete end-to-end.. input raw_text; output semantic interpretation\r\n    * not many dated tools and implementations sewn together; it is one\r\nwell-integrated implementation\r\n    * it does not require \"training\" and other fidgetting, and will work right\r\nout-of-the-box\r\n    * it is enriched with \"common sense\" knowledge about the everyday world,\r\nallowing it to escape many stupid interpretive mistakes. e.g.:\r\n          o \"(NX the/DT mosquito/NN bit/NN NX) (NX the/DT boy/NN NX)\" ==corrected==>\r\n          o \"(NX the/DT mosquito/NN NX) (VX bit/VBD VX) (NX the/DT boy/NN NX)\"\r\n    * it is lightweight and portable across platforms, written in portable\r\nPython and also available as a compiled Java library\r\n    * it is easy to customize by allowing for a user lexicon\r\n\r\nMontyLingua performs the following tasks over text:\r\n\r\n   1. MontyTokenizer - Tokenizes raw English text (sensitive to abbreviations),\r\nand resolve contractions, e.g. \"you're\" ==> \"you are\"\r\n   2. MontyTagger - Part-of-speech tagging based on Brill94, enriched with\r\ncommon sense.\r\n   3. MontyChunker - Lightning fast regular expression chunker\r\n   4. MontyExtractor - Extracts phrases and subject/verb/object triplets from\r\nsentences\r\n   5. MontyLemmatiser - Strips inflectional morphology, i.e. changes verbs to\r\ninfinitive form and nouns to singular form\r\n   6. MontyNLGenerator - Uses MontyLingua's concise predicate-arg representation\r\nto generate naturalistic English sentences and text summaries",
