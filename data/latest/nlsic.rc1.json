    "description": "NLSIC stands for \"Non-linear Least Squares with Inequality Constraints\". This algorithm was first published in Sokol et al. (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr716>. His advantage is in combination of the following features:\n\n    * Jacobi matrix *J* is not squared, i.e. *J^tJ* is not calculated, thus preserving the solution from condition number degradation. Instead, QR decomposition is used;\n    * taking into account inequality constraints is based on a well known NNLS algorithm by Lawson and Hanson;\n    * convergence in non-linear iterations is globalized by back-tracking method. I.e. with enough iterations, the process will reach a convergence point but no guaranty is given that it will be a global minimum;\n    * if *J* is rank deficient, a least norm (also known as \"minimum norm\") increment is used. To find such increment exactly (not just a regularized one) in presence of inequality constraints is not a trivial task. We use our own algorithm implemented in ``lsi_ln(...)`` function;\n    * if an initial approximation for a solution vector is outside of feasibility domain (FD) defined by inequality constraints then it is first projected on the FD (cf. ``ldp(...)``) and the non-linear iterations start afterward.\n    \nThis python implementation is an adaptation of the R one which is distributed with `influx_si <https://metasys.insa-toulouse.fr/software/influx/>`_ software. The original R version is in advance on this one. So users desiring to catch with the latest developments are invited to switch to the R version.\n\nThe main function to call is ``nlsic(...)``.",
