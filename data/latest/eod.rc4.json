[Disclaimer](#disclaimer-arrow_up)\n\n## General description [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\nThis library is the Python 🐍 unofficial SDK for the EOD Historical data REST API. It's intended to be used for data extraction for financial valuations, macroeconomic analyses, sentiment analysis, option strategies, technical analysis, development of machine learning models, and more!\n\n## Requirements [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\n- You need to request an API key with the EOD team. Create your account at the following [link](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/)\n\t- ***Please be aware of the pricing plans and policies. Different plans have different data accesses.***\n- ```Python``` >= 3.8\n\nIf any update or change is informed through the [Medium site](https://eod-historical-data.medium.com/) site of the API, I will implement it SDK. The revisions will be every month.\n\n## Installation [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\n\n```python\npip install eod\n```\n\n## Demo [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\n### REST API [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\nIt's highly recommendable to save your API keys in the environment variable. A short tutorial can be founded in the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8):\n\n[![Demo enviroment variables](https://j.gifs.com/LZlj1D.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8)\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# load the key from the enviroment variables\napi_key = os.environ['API_EOD']\n\nfrom eod import EodHistoricalData\n\n# Create the instance \nclient = EodHistoricalData(api_key)\n# predefine some instruments\nsymbol='AAPL.US'\ngoverment_bond = 'SW10Y.GBOND'\n\n# Quick usage\n# weekly prices for the Swiss goverment bond\nstock_prices = client.get_prices_eod(goverment_bond, period='w', order='a')\n\n# Fundamental data for the stock\nresp = client.get_fundamental_equity(symbol, filter_='Financials::Balance_Sheet::quarterly')\n```\n### Websocket [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk): \nThe EOD API have real-time data with a delay of less than 50ms via WebSockets for the US market, FOREX, and Cryptocurrencies. For US stocks our real-time data API supports pre-market and post-market hours (from 4 am till 8 pm EST). WebSockets API is available within All World Extended and/or All-In-One packages. More details in the [documentation](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/financial-apis/new-real-time-data-api-websockets/)\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\n# load the key from the enviroment variables\napi_key = os.environ['API_EOD']\n\n# Import WebSocket client library\nfrom websocket import create_connection\n\n# Connect to WebSocket API and subscribe to trade feed for Ethereum and Bitcoin\nws = create_connection(f\"wss://ws.eodhistoricaldata.com/ws/crypto?api_token={api_key}\")\nws.send('{\"action\": \"subscribe\", \"symbols\": \"ETH-USD,BTC-USD\"}')\n\n# Infinite loop waiting for WebSocket data\nwhile True:\n    result = ws.recv()\n    result = json.loads(result)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n## Documentation [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)\nPlease be aware that some descriptions will come directly from the API's documentation because no further explanations were needed for the specific method.
