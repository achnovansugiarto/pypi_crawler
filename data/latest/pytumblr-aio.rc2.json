Tokens are stored in ``~/.tumblr`` and are also shared by other Tumblr API clients like the Ruby client.\r\n\r\nRunning tests\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe tests (and coverage reports) are run with nose, like this:\r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n    python setup.py test\r\n\r\nCopyright and license\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Tumblr, Inc.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this work except in compliance with the License.
