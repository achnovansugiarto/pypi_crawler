Also, note that\n    some characters like \"!\" will be processed by Bash as some special\n    characters and results in unwanted behaviors, avoid them if you don't know\n    how to escape them.\n\n    Options:\n    --config-dir PATH  Path to the directory where the app config resides\n    --help             Show this message and exit.\n\n    Commands:\n    add      Add a new log entry\n    del      Remove an existing log entry\n    history  Browse your logs history\n    install  Install the required config\n    reset    Restart with a new install\n\nInstall\n*******\n\nBefore the first usage, each user have to use the following command: ::\n\n    captains-log install\n\nThis will automatically install all needed stuff in a dedicated app directory, default is to do it in a ``.captains-log`` directory in the user's home directory.\n\nIf you don't do this, the app will notify you about this missing stuff and will refuse to go further.\n\nYou can use an another directory for *captain's log* stuff but you will have to specify it, there is two ways for this :\n\n* Using ``--config-dir`` option each time you invoke the command line (this is option is available for all command line actions);\n* Set a shell environment variable named ``CAPTAINSLOG_DIR`` that contains the absolute path to the directory like this: ::\n    \n    export CAPTAINSLOG_DIR=/home/foo/my-captains-log-dir\n    \n  Or you can do it in your ``.bashrc``.\n\nNote that this app stuff have to be created for each user that want to use it, although you should be able to share it between them if needed.\n\nReset\n*****\n\nSometime you will need to *reset* your install, so use this : ::\n\n    captains-log reset\n\nThis will **remove all your content** (database and config) then re-launch the install process. Take care to backup your config before if you don't want to lose them, the command line doesn't care about this for you.\n    \nAdding an entry\n***************\n\nAdd an entry message without a category: ::\n\n    captains-log add Hello\n\nAdd an entry message with a category: ::\n\n    captains-log add -c Foo Hello\n\nYou have to quote your texts if they contain spaces: ::\n\n    captains-log add -c \"Foo bar\" \"Hello world.\"\n\nAlso, note that your shell can interprets some characters like ``!`` even if quoted, just avoid them if you don't know how to escape them (when it's possible).\n\nWhen an entry is created, the command line will return its ID than you can't use to remove it if needed.\n\nRemoving an entry\n*****************\n\nJust use the entry ID you want to remove: ::\n\n    captains-log del 42\n\nRemoving the last created entry using the special keyword ``last``: ::\n\n    captains-log del last\n\nBe aware that there is no confirmation prompt before removing the entry.\n\nHistory\n*******\n\nThe history *browser* allow you to see your created entries: ::\n\n    captains-log history\n\nThis will display your history like this: ::\n\n    Monday, 12 December 2014\n    ========================\n\n     97) [10:00]                Wake up\n     98) [11:15] MyCategory     Starting to do stuff\n\n    Wednesday 25 December 2014\n    ==========================\n\n     99) [10:00]                Coffee time\n    100) [11:15] MyCategory     Ping\n    101) [17:49] Other category Hello world\n    102) [18:33] MyCategory     Pong\n\n    Friday 26 December 2014\n    =======================\n\n    103) [09:15] MyCategory     Fix a bug\n    104) [10:00]                Coffee time\n    105) [15:40] Other category Waiting answer\n    106) [17:45] MyCategory     Go to production\n\nActually, the default behavior is to display all your entries from any date period. But the command line action accepts an optional argument to give a keyword about the period you want to see: ::\n\n    # Entries of the current year\n    captains-log history year\n    \n    # Entries of the current month\n    captains-log history month\n    \n    # Entries of the current day\n    captains-log history day\n    \n    # Entries that contains \"Coffee\"\n    captains-log history -s \"Coffee\"\n\nThe history is columnized and even have colorized parts if your shell and terminal console support them. Also you can change some formatting from your settings file if needed like changing the date format, see the *Setting* part.\n\nSettings\n********\n\nIn your installed Captain's log directory from the ``install`` action, there is a ``settings.json`` file where you can change some settings that can change some behaviors.\n\n::\n\n    {\n        \"ENTRY_TIME_FORMAT\": \"%H:%M\", \n        \"LANGUAGE_CODE\": \"\", \n        \"DATABASE_NAME\": \"database.sqlite3\", \n        \"ENTRY_DATE_TEMPLATE\": \"[{0}]\", \n        \"ENTRY_ID_TEMPLATE\": \"{0})\", \n        \"ENTRY_CATEGORY_TEMPLATE\": \"{0}\", \n        \"GROUP_MONTH_FORMAT\": \"%A, %d %B %Y\", \n        \"ENTRY_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE\": \"{0}\"\n    }\n\nWhere :\n\n* ``ENTRY_TIME_FORMAT`` is the time format to use when displaying an entry time;\n* ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` is a locale code that is supported on your system like \"fr_FR.UTF-8\", let it to an empty string to automatically use your system locale;\n* ``DATABASE_NAME`` is the filename for the sqlite3 database file installed in the Captain's log directory;\n* ``ENTRY_ID_TEMPLATE`` is the template string to format the entry's ID;\n* ``ENTRY_CATEGORY_TEMPLATE`` is the template string to format the entry's category name;\n* ``ENTRY_DATE_TEMPLATE`` is the template string to format the entry's day datetime (it's string display, not the date format itself);\n* ``ENTRY_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`` is the template string to format the entry's message;\n* ``GROUP_MONTH_FORMAT`` is the datetime format to use when displaying a day date (the title for each day group);",
