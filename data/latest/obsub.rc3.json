    "description": "obsub\n=====\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage| |Version| |Downloads| |License|\n\nSmall python module that implements the observer pattern via a\ndecorator.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis is based on a `thread on stackoverflow\n<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1904351/python-observer-pattern-examples-tips>`_\n(the example of C#-like events by Jason Orendorff), so I don't take any\ncredit for the idea. I merely made a fancy module with documentation and\ntests out of it, since I needed it in a bigger project. It is quite\nhandy and I've been using it in a couple of projects, which require some\nsort of event handling.\n\nThus it is `licensed as\nCC0 <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`__, so basically\ndo-whatever-you-want to the extent legally possible.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n*obsub* is available on PyPI, so you can simply install it using\n``pip install obsub`` or you do it manually using ``setup.py`` as with\nany python package.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe ``event`` decorator from the ``obsub`` module is used as follows:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from obsub import event\n\n    # Define a class with an event\n    class Subject(object):\n        @event\n        def on_stuff(self, arg):\n            print('Stuff {} happens'.format(arg))\n\n    # Now define an event handler, the observer\n    def handler(subject, arg):\n        print('Stuff {} is handled'.format(arg))\n\n    # Wire everything up...\n    sub = Subject()\n    sub.on_stuff += handler\n\n    # And try it!\n    sub.on_stuff('foo')\n\nYou should now get both print messages from the event itself and the\nevent handler function, like so:\n\n::\n\n    Stuff foo happens\n    Stuff foo is handled\n\n\nContinuous integration\n----------------------\n\nFor the fun of it, `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/obsub>`__\nis used for continuous integration. As long as everything is fine, the\nbutton below should be green and shiny!\n\n|Build Status|\n\nThe continuous integration ensures that our tests run on the following\nplatforms:\n\n-  Python 2.6, 2.7\n-  Python 3.2, 3.3\n-  pypy\n\nIt might also work on Python 2.5, but is not automatically tested with this\nversion.\n\nWe also track the coverage of our tests with coveralls.io\n\n|Coverage|\n\nUse `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage>`__ to generate local\ncoverage reports like this:\n\n::\n\n    coverage run setup.py nosetests\n\nNote: on some platforms (e.g. Ubuntu) the executable is called\n``python-coverage``.\n\n\nContribution and feedback\n-------------------------\n\n*obsub* is developed on `github <https://github.com/aepsil0n/obsub>`__.\n\nIf you have any questions about this software or encounter bugs, you're welcome\nto open a `new issue on github <https://github.com/aepsil0n/obsub/issues/new>`__.\n\nIn case you do not want to use github for some reason, you can alternatively\nsend an email one of us:\n\n- `Eduard Bopp <eduard.bopp@aepsil0n.de>`__\n- `André-Patrick Bubel <code@andre-bubel.de>`__\n- `Thomas Gläßle <t_glaessle@gmx.de>`__\n\nFeel free to contribute patches as pull requests as you see fit. Try to be\nconsistent with PEP 8 guidelines as far as possible and test everything.\nOtherwise, your commit messages should start with a capitalized verb for\nconsistency. Unless your modification is completely trivial, also add a message\nbody to your commit.\n\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to Jason Orendorff on for the idea on stackoverflow. I also want\nto thank @coldfix and @Moredread for contributions and feedback.\n\n.. |Downloads| image:: https://pypip.in/d/obsub/badge.png\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obsub/\n   :alt: Downloads\n.. |Version| image:: https://pypip.in/v/obsub/badge.png\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obsub/\n   :alt: Latest Version\n.. |License| image:: https://pypip.in/license/obsub/badge.png\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obsub/\n   :alt: License\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/obsub.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/obsub\n.. |Coverage| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/aepsil0n/obsub/badge.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/aepsil0n/obsub\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nv0.2\n~~~~\n\nFrom a user perspective the preservation of function signatures and a couple of\nbug fixes are probably most relevant. Python 2.5 is no longer tested by\ncontinuous integration, though we try to avoid unnecessary changes that might\nbreak backwards compatibility.\n\nIn addition, there are quite a number of changes that mostly concern\ndevelopers.\n\n- Function signatures are now preserved correctly by the event decorator. This\n  is true only for python3. On python2 there is no support for default\n  arguments, currently\n- Some fixes to memory handling and tests thereof. This includes a more generic\n  handling of the garbage collection process within the test suite to make it\n  pass on pypy, too.\n- Massive refactoring of test suite from one very long doctest to more focussed\n  unit tests.\n- The documentation has been converted from Markdown to reStructuredText, since\n  it is compatible with both PyPI and GitHub.\n- Various improvements and some streamlining of the documentation.\n- Fix package name in license.\n- Continuous integration now includes coveralls.io support.\n- Support for Python 2.5 is no longer tested using Travis CI, since they have\n  dropped support for this version.\n\n\nv0.1.1\n~~~~~~\n\n- Add __all__ attribute to module\n- Fix a couple of documentation issues\n\n\nv0.1\n~~~~\n\n*Initial release*",
