DOCUMENTATION - GLOAMING\n\nScene settles on an UNKNOWN MAN, feverishly writing with an overly fancy\nquill at a writing desk. Several crumpled papers are around him, but there\nis a sizeable stack intact, scrawled with text. The writing desk is butted\nagainst a large window, with a beautiful view of the dwindling sunset.\nBookshelves crammed with books flank the window; it is clear the books are\nfrequently taken down and put back in different spots. AUDIENCE gently opens\na nearby door.\n\n                              AUDIENCE\n                              (whispering)\n            Oh! Excuse me, i didn't mean to intrude.\n\nThe UNKNOWN MAN does not look up, as if he did not hear AUDIENCE. He continues\nwriting.\n\n                              NARRATOR (V.O.)\n            This young man is the Playwright extension for\n            ScreenPy. He is relatively new here, but he has\n            quite a large reputation backing him.\n\n                              AUDIENCE\n            Can he hear me? And wait, he's a real man?\n\n                              NARRATOR (V.O.)\n            He is singularly focused. He is real, in a sense.\n\n                              AUDIENCE\n            Does he ever, y'know... eat? Sleep?\n\n                              NARRATOR (V.O.)\n            No.\n\n                              AUDIENCE\n            All right, you've got a strange definition of \"real.\"\n\nAUDIENCE takes one last look at PLAYWRIGHT before leaving, softly closing\nthe door behind them.\n\n                                                                      FADE OUT\n```\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n    pip install screenpy_playwright\n\nor\n\n    pip install screenpy[playwright]\n\n\nDocumentation\n----------\nPlease check out the [Read The Docs documentation](https://screenpy-playwright-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nfor the latest information about this module!\n\n\nContributing\n------------\nYou want to contribute?
