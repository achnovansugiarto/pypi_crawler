    "description": "# Trilobyte\n_Powerful text pattern parsing made intuitive_\n\nKey features:\n* Variable assignment\n* Smart algorithm\n* Powerful expressions\n\nUsing an algorithm based on text _keypoints_, Trilobyte's implementation differs vastly from most other text searching engines available, such as those for Regex. A somewhat high-level overview of the algorithm is presented near the top of [`./trilobyte/keypoints/classes.py`](./trilobyte/keypoints/classes.py). This is copied below:\n```python\n# @dev\n# If inputs have so far matched keypoint but keypoint is not yet completed,\n#     `matched` = False, `completed` = False\n# If previous inputs have matched keypoint, keypoint is complete, and next input does not match,\n#     `matched` = True, `completed` = True\n# If inputs have so far matched keypoint and keypoint is completed and cannot go on,\n#     `matched` = True, `completed` = True\n# If inputs have so far matched keypoint and keypoint is completed but can still go on,\n#     `matched` = True, `completed` = False\n# If previous inputs have matched keypoint, keypoint is yet to complete, and current input does not match,\n#     `matched` = False, `completed` = True\n\n# @dev\n# @algorithm\n# If !`matched` and !`completed` continue on current search branch with current keypoint\n# If  `matched` and !`completed` continue on current search branch with current keypoint,\n#                                while also forking a new search branch with next keypoint\n# If !`matched` and `completed`  delete current search branch\n# If  `matched` and `completed`  continue on current search branch with next keypoint\n\n# @dev\n# @algorithm\n# Open new search branch with root keypoint at every new character in sequence\n\n# @dev\n# @algorithm\n# When all branches have been computed, resolve conflicting (overlapping) branches,\n# giving priority to branches discovered first (unless user specifies otherwise).\n# Then, if user does not want recursive search, remove branches nested inside bigger branches.\n\n# @update\n# Kill branch early if already overlapped\n```\n\n## Docs\n\n_Trilobyte is still under development; the following commands have mostly been implemented programmatically, but cannot be parsed from plain text yet._\n\n```\n\\                               / Makes the trilo treat the following expression as normal text\n~ ( num ) [ pat ]               / Take the negative of pat, optionally supplying max checking length as a\n                                  number `num`\n* [ text ]                        Ignore case\n\n{ char1 - char2 }               / Command that detects any character between char1 and char2 on UNICODE\n                                  (inclusive)\n{ pat1 , pat2 , pat3 , ... }    / Command that detects any trilo between the list of alternatives (use `\\,`\n                                  to avoid compiler treating `,` as a delimiter)\n\n@r ( $var / num ) [ pat ]       / Command that detects repeated patterns of pat (r for repeat),\n                                  optionally specify a variable name `var` for the number of repetitions matched,\n                                  or supplying a number `num` which fixes the number of repetitions\n@d [ delim_pat ] [ pat ]        / Command that detects a list of pat delimited by delim_pat (d for delimited)\n@a [ main_pat ] [ rep_pat ]     / Command that detects main_pat, followed by an optional repeated occurrence of\n                                  rep_pat after (a for after)\n@b [ rep_pat ] [ main_pat ]     / Command that detects main_pat, preceded by an optional repeated occurrence of\n                                  rep_pat before (b for before)\n\n%s                              / The space character\n%t                              / The tab character\n%n                              / The newline character\n%r                              / The return character\n\n%w                              / Any whitespace character, including newline\n%m                              / Only spaces or tabs (m = s + t, also think of it mono - all on 1 line!)\n%f                              / Only newline or return (f = n + r, also think of it as flush)\n%U                              / Any uppercase character\n%l                              / Any lowercase character\n%a                              / Any alphabetical character\n%d                              / Any numerical digit\n%b                              / Any alphanumeric character (b for basic)\n\n%v                              / Shorthand for any sequence of alphanumeric characters that doesn't\n                                  start with a number (v for variable, as these are generally named in\n                                  this convention)\n%o                              / Shorthand for repetition of %w (o = r + w, also think of it as omni -\n                                  everything!)\n%e                              / Shorthand for repetition of %m (e = r + m, also think of it as exclusive)\n%x                              / Shorthand for repetition of %f (x = r + f, also think of X as separation -\n                                  that's what a sequence of %f is anyway)\n%p                              / Shorthand for any comma-delimited sequence of %v (v for parameters, as\n                                  these are generally formatted in this convention)\n\n$var [ pat ]                    / Represents the expression that follows pat as a variable (use '' for pat\n                                  in order to detect any possible expression)\n```\n\n\n",
