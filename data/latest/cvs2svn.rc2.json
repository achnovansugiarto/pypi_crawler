    "description": "cvs2svn_ is a tool for migrating a CVS repository to Subversion_, git_,\nBazaar_, or Mercurial_. The main design goals are robustness and 100% data\npreservation. cvs2svn can convert just about any CVS repository we've ever\nseen, including gcc, Mozilla, FreeBSD, KDE, GNOME...\n\n.. _cvs2svn: http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/\n.. _Subversion: http://svn.tigris.org/\n.. _git: http://git-scm.com/\n.. _Bazaar: http://bazaar-vcs.org/\n.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/\n\ncvs2svn infers what happened in the history of your CVS repository and\nreplicates that history as accurately as possible in the target SCM. All\nrevisions, branches, tags, log messages, author names, and commit dates are\nconverted. cvs2svn deduces what CVS modifications were made at the same time,\nand outputs these modifications grouped together as changesets in the target\nSCM. cvs2svn also deals with many CVS quirks and is highly configurable.\nSee the comprehensive `feature list`_.\n\n.. _feature list: http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/features.html\n.. _documentation: http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2svn.html\n\nPlease read the documentation_ carefully before using cvs2svn.\n\n\nLatest development version\n--------------------------\n\nFor general use, the most recent released version of cvs2svn is usually the\nbest choice. However, if you want to use the newest cvs2svn features or if\nyou're debugging or patching cvs2svn, you might want to use the trunk version\n(which is usually quite stable). To do so, use Subversion to check out a\nworking copy from http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk/ using a command\nlike::\n\n  svn co --username=guest http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk cvs2svn-trunk\n\n(the password is empty; i.e., just press return).",
