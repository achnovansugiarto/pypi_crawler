    "description": "Job-Runner Worker\n=================\n\nThis package contains the Job-Runner Worker, which is responsible for executing\nthe scheduled jobs managed by the Job-Runner.\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n* `documentation <https://job-runner.readthedocs.org/>`_\n* `source <https://github.com/spilgames/job-runner-worker/>`_\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nRequirements (depending on your distro, the naming might be a bit different):\n\n* ``python-dev``\n* ``build-essential``\n* ``libevent-dev``\n\nThen you should be able to install this package with\n``pip install job-runner-worker``.\n\nIf you want to install this package in development mode, clone this repository\nand then execute ``python setup.py develop``. In the latter, you might want\nto install the testing requirements by executing\n``pip install -r test-requirements.txt``.\n\nSee the getting started section in the Job-Runner documentation (\nin the *job-runner* repo) for setting up the whole project.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nExample with required settings::\n\n    [job_runner_worker]\n    api_base_url=http://domain.of.job.runner/\n    api_key=worker1\n    secret=verysecret\n    script_temp_path=/tmp\n    ws_server_hostname=domain.of.websocket.server\n    broadcaster_server_hostname=domain.of.broadcast.server\n\n\nAll available settings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``api_base_url``\n    The base URL which will be used to access the API. This should start with\n    ``http://`` or ``https://``.\n\n``api_key``\n    Public-key to access the API.\n\n``secret``\n    Private-key to access the API.\n\n``concurrent_jobs``\n    The number of jobs to run concurrently. Default: ``4``.\n\n``log_level``\n    The log level. Default: ``'info'``. Valid options are:\n\n    * ``debug``\n    * ``info``\n    * ``warning``\n    * ``error``\n\n``max_log_bytes``\n    The maximum number of bytes of the log that is sent back to the API. This\n    is to avoid ``413 Request Entity Too Large`` errors. If the log will be\n    larger than this value, 20% of the allowed size will be taken from the top\n    of the log, the remaining 80% will be taken from the bottom. Everything\n    in between will be truncated. Default: ``819200`` (800kb).\n\n``ws_server_hostname``\n    The hostname of the WebSocket Server.\n\n``ws_server_port``\n    The port of the WebSocket Server. Default: ``5555``.\n\n``script_temp_path``\n    The path where the scripts that are being executed through the Job-Runner\n    are temporarily stored. Default: ``'/tmp'``.\n\n``broadcaster_server_hostname``\n    The hostname of the queue broadcaster server.\n\n``broadcaster_server_port``\n    The port of the queue broadcaster server. Default: ``5556``.\n\n``reconnect_after_inactivity``\n    Seconds after which the subscriber is re-connecting to the publisher\n    when no data has been received. Default: ``300``. This is useful when you\n    are loadbalancing the publisher and it keeps the TCP connection open on the\n    front-end, when the connection on the back-end has been closed. Because of\n    this ZMQ doesn't detect that it is not connected anymore and jobs get\n    stuck.\n\n\nCommand-line usage\n------------------\n\nFor starting the worker, you can use the ``job_runner_worker`` command::\n\n    usage: job_runner_worker [-h] [--config-path CONFIG_PATH]\n\n    Job Runner worker (v2.1.0)\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --config-path CONFIG_PATH\n                            absolute path to config file (default: CONFIG_PATH env\n                            variable)\n\n\nChanges\n-------\n\nv2.1.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Rollback retry on 4xx errors. Instead, recover when an unexpected error\n  occurs in the ``execute_run``, ``enqueue_actions``, or ``kill_run``. This\n  will recover from when a run was claimed by two workers (e.g. in the case\n  when it was sent to worker a, which doesn't respond directly, then it was\n  sent to worker b which claims it after which a claims it too).\n\n\nv2.1.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make sure a shebang does exist on scripts to be run. Use shlex to make\n  Popen safer.\n* Retry request 5x when the response is in the 4xx range before raising an\n  exception.\n\n\nv2.1.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* On ping response, send back the version of the worker and the number of\n  concurrent jobs. This version requires that you have ``job-runner>=3.4.0``\n  running.\n\n\nv2.0.3\n~~~~~~\n\n* Update error message when job does not start to be more verbose and specific.\n\n\nv2.0.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix the case where in case of an exception, the run was marked as completed\n  but not started.\n\n\nv2.0.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make sure to only cleanup runs that are assigned to the worker. This version\n  is dependent on ``job-runner>=3.0.1``.\n\n\nv2.0.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make the worker compatible with the new worker-pool structure.\n  **IMPORTANT:** This version is dependent on ``job-runner>=2.0.0``!\n* Change ``SETTINGS_PATH`` environment variable to ``CONFIG_PATH`` for better\n  naming consistency.\n* Make sure that when a run already has log, it is updated (before it would\n  hang on the database integrity error).\n\n\nv1.2.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make the worker crash early instead of hanging on errors happening before the\n  actual job starts, to give the user a visible cue that something went wrong.\n\n\nv1.2.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* The worker will now terminate gracefully when receiving the ``TERM`` signal.\n  This means that all pending jobs will be completed, but that it will not\n  accept any new jobs. After finishing the last pending job, the worker will\n  terminate.\n\n\nv1.1.4\n~~~~~~\n\n* Set ``reconnect_after_inactivity`` default to 10 minutes. This is 2 x the\n  ``JOB_RUNNER_WORKER_PING_INTERVAL`` default setting in Job-Runner.\n\n\nv1.1.3\n~~~~~~\n\n* Implement handler for ``ping`` action.\n\n\nv1.1.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Add and implement ``reconnect_after_inactivity`` setting.\n\n\nv1.1.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Run script by finding their shebang without the x bit being needed.\n\n\nv1.1.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Handle separate run log-output resource. This requires Job-Runner >= v1.3.0.\n\n\nv1.0.7\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix killing job-runs. Where *v1.0.5* was killing children processes, it did\n  not kill children of children, ... This should kill the full tree of\n  child-processes.\n\n\nv1.0.6\n~~~~~~\n\n* Freeze requests library version, since 1.0.0 contains backwards compatible\n  changes.\n\n\nv1.0.5\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix killing job-runs. When the process had sub-processes, only the parent\n  process was killed and the worker was waiting for the child-processes to\n  complete.\n\n\nv1.0.4\n~~~~~~\n\n* Add config variable ``max_log_bytes`` to limit the amount of logdata that\n  will be send back to the API (to avoid ``413 Request Entity Too Large``\n  errors).\n\n\nv1.0.3\n~~~~~~\n\n* Send ``pid`` back to the REST API when a job has been started.\n* Kill a job-run when a ``kill`` action is received.\n\n\nv1.0.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make sure that the API exactly matches.\n\n\nv1.0.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make the timezones send to the REST API timezone aware.\n\n\nv1.0.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Deployar related changes.\n\n\nv0.7.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix encoding issue when writing the file.\n\n\nv0.7.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Refactor to make the worker compatible with the 0.7 version of the\n  ``job-runner`` package.\n* Make it consume runs from the queue broadcaster instead of hitting the REST\n  interface every x seconds.\n* Add retry on error to recover from temporary REST interface errors.\n\n\nv0.6.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Merge fixes v0.5.1 and v0.5.2 into v0.6.x version.\n\n\nv0.6.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Refactor to make use of separate WebSocket Server.\n\n\nv0.5.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Make temporary path for scripts configurable.\n\n\nv0.5.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Disable SSL certificate validation.\n\n\nv0.5.0\n~~~~~~\n\n* Initial release.",
