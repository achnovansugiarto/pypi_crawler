    "description": "# Getting started\r\n\r\nThis is the **beta version** of the public API for the Greenbyte Platform.\r\nIt contains **new features** (endpoints, parameters, etc.) that we\r\nencourage you to try out before they are released as a stable version.\r\n\r\n**Note that some details might change**, meaning that any SDKs\r\ndownloaded for this version might have minor incompatibilities in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nFeatures that are in beta are clearly marked with the label \"**(BETA)**\"\r\nso that you can know what features are stable. If you would rather view\r\nthe latest stable API documentation, please use the version selection\r\ndropdown in the top right of the page.\r\n\r\n# What's new\r\n## 2022-02-01 - New high resolution endpoint\r\nA new [data endpoint](#/http/api-endpoints/data/get-high-res-data) has been added which allows you to fetch high resolution data for up to one hour in the past 12 hours.\r\n\r\n## 2022-01-24 - More plan endpoint additions\r\n* [List Device Accesses for multiple Site Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-device-accesses-for-multiple-site-accesses) - a new endpoint that lists all the Device Accesses for one or more specified SiteAccessID(s).\r\n* [Get Personnel By ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-personnel) - a new endpoint that gets personnel info for a specified Personnel ID.\r\n\r\n## 2022-01-17 - Various improvements and addition of several new endpoints\r\n* A taxonomy component object with ID and name has been added to the status endpoints.\r\n* [List Comments for multiple Tasks](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-comments-for-multiple-tasks) - a new endpoint that lists all the comments for one or more specified TaskId(s).\r\n\r\n## 2021-08-23 - Plan Get endpoints\r\nPlan endpoints for getting individual items by ID have been added as a compliment to the existing List endpoints.\r\nThis includes:\r\n* [Get Task by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-task)\r\n* [Get Downtime by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-downtime-event)\r\n* [Get Site Access by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-site-access)\r\n* [Get Device Access by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-device-access)\r\n\r\n## 2021-04-29 - Python SDK now on PyPi\r\nThe Python SDK is now available as a package on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/greenbyteapi/).\r\nWe will be updating this regularly in parallel with updates to the API specifications.\r\n\r\n## 2021-04-27 - Improvement to endpoints\r\nGet Data Signals: Device type (ID and title) has been added to the response for every data signal\r\nto make it easier to differentiate signals with the same name.\r\n\r\nGet Data Per Category: Category time has been added to the response for every data per category item.\r\n\r\n## 2021-04-12 - Improvement to List Status endpoint\r\nTurbine status ID has been added to the status endpoint.\r\n\r\n## 2021-03-22 - Improvement to List Site Accesses endpoint\r\nThe List Site Accesses endpoint now returns all individual personnel and the times they accessed the site.\r\n\r\n## 2021-03-15 - Improvements to Plan endpoints\r\nThe List Tasks endpoint now returns related metadata fields.\r\n\r\n## 2021-02-15 - More Plan endpoints **(BETA)**\r\nWe have added the following endpoints under the **Plan** section:\r\n* [List Task Categories](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-categories)\r\n* [List Organizations](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-organizations)\r\n* [List Personnel](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-personnel)\r\n* [List Task Files](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-files)\r\n* [Download Task File](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/download-task-file)\r\n\r\n## 2021-02-08 - Add UTC support\r\nUTC support has been added for all endpoints that return timestamps.\r\nBy setting the `useUtc` flag to true timestamps will be returned in UTC time zone instead of client time zone.\r\nThe flag is set to false by default.\r\n\r\n## 2021-01-25 - Plan endpoints **(BETA)**\r\nWe have introduced a **Plan** section containing the following endpoints:\r\n* [List Tasks](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-tasks)\r\n* [List Task Comments](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-comments)\r\n* [List Downtime Events](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-downtime-events)\r\n* [List Site Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-site-accesses)\r\n* [List Device Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-device-accesses)\r\n\r\n## 2021-01-18 - API key authentication changes\r\nThe preferred method of authenticating with the API is now to pass the\r\nAPI key via the HTTP header `X-Api-Key`. The old methods, passing it as\r\nquery parameter or via the old header `Breeze-ApiToken`, will continue\r\nto work but are deprecated.\r\n\r\nNote that this change causes a breaking change in some of the SDKs, for\r\nexample, if you use the C# SDK and explicitly set the API key on the\r\n`Configuration` class. This is only an issue if you download a new\r\nversion of the SDK and want to use it with existing code.\r\n* Solution: Instead of adding the API key to the\r\n  `ApiToken`/`BreezeApiToken` property, you need to use the `XApiKey`\r\n  property.\r\n\r\n## 2021-01-11 - Optional `.json` suffix\r\nThe `.json` suffix is no longer necessary when calling the API. That\r\nmeans that calls to for instance `configuration` or `configuration.json`\r\nwill return the same result. Endpoints that currently support the\r\n`.json` suffix will continue to do so but it is considered deprecated.\r\n\r\n## 2020-08-31 - Endpoint permissions\r\nWe have added more fine-grained permissions for the API. When creating or editing an API key, you can now set permissions for specific API endpoints ([API key guide](#/http/guides/managing-api-keys)). Existing API keys will have permissions for all existing endpoints.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for specific endpoints for information on which permissions are required.\r\n\r\n## 2020-08-28 - Improvement for status endpoints\r\nIt is now possible to select which lost production signal will be returned when requesting status data from the API. The following endpoints are affected:\r\n* [Get Statuses](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-statuses)\r\n* [Get Active Statuses](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-active-statuses)\r\n\r\n## 2020-08-20 - Real Time Data and Data Per Category endpoints aggregation by site level\r\nYou can now aggregate your data based on site hierarchy levels when calling the Real Time Data and Data Per Category endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe new `siteLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) enable this new type of aggregation.\r\n\r\n## 2020-06-29 - Site endpoint\r\nWe have added a new endpoint for fetching sites and related meta data.\r\nYou can find more information about this endpoint here:\r\n[Get Sites](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-sites).\r\n\r\n## 2020-06-29 - Device endpoint improvements\r\nThe Device endpoint has been improved:\r\n* New request parameters for filtering on sites (`siteIds`) and/or\r\n  parent devices (`parentIds`).\r\n* New response fields for device type (`deviceTypeId`), parent device\r\n  (`parentId`), and child devices (`childIds`)\r\n\r\n## 2020-06-29 - Data endpoint aggregation by site level\r\nYou can now aggregate your data according to the site hierarchy which you can see in the device selector when calling the Data endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe new `siteLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) aggregates data based on the site hierarchy.\r\n\r\n## 2020-06-29 - Minor API improvements\r\n### Problem description in error responses\r\nAPI error responses such as *400 Bad Request* now contain details about\r\nwhat is wrong, for example, if a request parameter is missing or has\r\ninvalid value. See the error response description for each endpoint for\r\nspecific examples.\r\n\r\n### Changes to HTTP rate limit headers\r\nThe format of the HTTP headers regarding rate limiting has changed:\r\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - This now contains the rate limit period as a\r\n  string (previously the number of allowed requests for a given period).\r\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - The remaining number of requests for this\r\n  period (like before, no change).\r\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - This now contains the UTC timestamp string when\r\n  the remaining number of requests resets (previously the number of\r\n  seconds left until the end of the period).\r\n\r\nMore information is available under the *429 Too Many Requests* error\r\nresponse description for each endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Support for time zone offsets in timestamp parameters\r\nIt is now possible to specify timestamp strings with an explicit time\r\nzone (UTC) offset, for example \"2020-05-10T09:00:00+01:30\".\r\n\r\n### Proper use of error response codes\r\nSome error responses with the code *401 Unauthorized* will now instead\r\nbe *403 Forbidden* to better match web API best practices. This is work\r\nin progress, with the goal of having all failed authorization checks\r\nreturn code 403 rather than 401 in the future.\r\n\r\n## 2020-06-08 - Data endpoint aggregation by group\r\nIf you have divided you sites into groups of assets, you can now aggregate your data by those groups when calling the Data, Real Time Data, and Data Per Category endpoints.\r\nThe new `deviceLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) aggregates data based on the hierarchy level directly below site.\r\n\r\n## 2020-04-27 - Data signal permissions\r\nIt is now possible to set permissions for individual data signals for API keys (**Share** > **API Keys** in the Greenbyte\r\nPlatform). When adding/editing an API key, there is a new option to select authorized data signals in addition to the\r\ndevice selection. Leaving the signal selection blank (nothing selected) gives permission to all current and future data\r\nsignals, just like previously created API keys.\r\n\r\nAPI endpoints affected by data signal permissions:\r\n* `datasignals.json`: filters returned data signals based on permissions.\r\n* `data.json`, `realtimedata.json`, `datapercategory.json`: gives *401 Unauthorized* error for data signals without permission.\r\n* `status.json`, `activestatus.json`: may omit lost production values (in the `lostProduction` field) based on data signal permissions.\r\n\r\n## 2020-03-30 - Data Per Category endpoint\r\nWe have added a new endpoint to the Greenbyte Platform to make it possible to extract Lost Production data per contract category from the API. You can find more information about this endpoint here: [Data Per Category](#/http/api-endpoints/data/get-data-per-category).\r\n\r\n# General notes regarding endpoints\r\n\r\n* Some endpoints take `page` and `pageSize` parameters in order to\r\n  support fetching data in chunks. The default values are 50 for\r\n  `pageSize` and 1 for `page`, meaning that the first 50 items will be\r\n  returned. These endpoints also return a `Link` header as defined in\r\n  [RFC 8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288).\r\n* Some endpoints return data in the time zone configured in the Greenbyte Platform. This time zone can\r\n  be fetched from the `configuration.json` endpoint.\r\n* Some endpoints can also be reached using the POST method, with a JSON\r\n  request body instead of query parameters. As this is a legacy option,\r\n  make sure to use the legacy version of the endpoints, ending in `.json` (e.g. `data.json`).\r\n* All endpoints implement rate limiting, which is currently 1,000\r\n  requests/minute per API key and IP address. More information is\r\n  available under the *429 Too Many Requests* error response description\r\n  for each endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Build\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must have Python ```2 >=2.7.9``` or Python ```3 >=3.4``` installed on your system to install and run this SDK. This SDK package depends on other Python packages like nose, jsonpickle etc. \r\nThese dependencies are defined in the ```requirements.txt``` file that comes with the SDK.\r\nTo resolve these dependencies, you can use the PIP Dependency manager. Install it by following steps at [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).\r\n\r\nPython and PIP executables should be defined in your PATH. Open command prompt and type ```pip --version```.\r\nThis should display the version of the PIP Dependency Manager installed if your installation was successful and the paths are properly defined.\r\n\r\n* Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including ```requirements.txt```) for the SDK.\r\n* Run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This should install all the required dependencies.\r\n\r\n![Building SDK - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=installDependencies&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nThe following section explains how to use the Greenbyteapi SDK package in a new project.\r\n\r\n### 1. Open Project in an IDE\r\n\r\nOpen up a Python IDE like PyCharm. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.\r\n\r\n![Open project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=pyCharm)\r\n\r\nClick on ```Open``` in PyCharm to browse to your generated SDK directory and then click ```OK```.\r\n\r\n![Open project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject0&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python)     \r\n\r\nThe project files will be displayed in the side bar as follows:\r\n\r\n![Open project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject1&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python&projectName=greenbyteapi)     \r\n\r\n### 2. Add a new Test Project\r\n\r\nCreate a new directory by right clicking on the solution name as shown below:\r\n\r\n![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createDirectory&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python&projectName=greenbyteapi)\r\n\r\nName the directory as \"test\"\r\n\r\n![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameDirectory)\r\n   \r\nAdd a python file to this project with the name \"testsdk\"\r\n\r\n![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createFile&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python&projectName=greenbyteapi)\r\n\r\nName it \"testsdk\"\r\n\r\n![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameFile)\r\n\r\nIn your python file you will be required to import the generated python library using the following code lines\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom greenbyteapi.greenbyteapi_client import GreenbyteapiClient\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=projectFiles&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python&libraryName=greenbyteapi.greenbyteapi_client&projectName=greenbyteapi&className=GreenbyteapiClient)\r\n\r\nAfter this you can write code to instantiate an API client object, get a controller object and  make API calls. Sample code is given in the subsequent sections.\r\n\r\n### 3. Run the Test Project\r\n\r\nTo run the file within your test project, right click on your Python file inside your Test project and click on ```Run```\r\n\r\n![Run Test Project - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python&libraryName=greenbyteapi.greenbyteapi_client&projectName=greenbyteapi&className=GreenbyteapiClient)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Test\r\n\r\nYou can test the generated SDK and the server with automatically generated test\r\ncases. unittest is used as the testing framework and nose is used as the test\r\nrunner. You can run the tests as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.\r\n  2. Invoke ```pip install -r test-requirements.txt```\r\n  3. Invoke ```nosetests```\r\n\r\n## Initialization\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\nIn order to setup authentication and initialization of the API client, you need the following information.\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description |\r\n|-----------|-------------|\r\n| x_api_key | TODO: add a description |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI client can be initialized as following.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Configuration parameters and credentials\r\nx_api_key = 'x_api_key'\r\n\r\nclient = GreenbyteapiClient(x_api_key)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Class Reference\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"list_of_controllers\"></a>List of Controllers\r\n\r\n* [DataController](#data_controller)\r\n* [StatusesController](#statuses_controller)\r\n* [ConfigurationDataController](#configuration_data_controller)\r\n* [AssetsController](#assets_controller)\r\n* [AlertsController](#alerts_controller)\r\n* [PlanController](#plan_controller)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"data_controller\"></a>![Class: ](https://apidocs.io/img/class.png \".DataController\") DataController\r\n\r\n### Get controller instance\r\n\r\nAn instance of the ``` DataController ``` class can be accessed from the API Client.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n data_controller = client.data\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"get_data_signals\"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png \".DataController.get_data_signals\") get_data_signals\r\n\r\n> Gets authorized data signals for one or more devices.\r\n> \r\n> _🔐 This endpoint requires the **Data** endpoint permission._\r\n> \r\n> _This request can also be made using the POST method, \r\n> with a request to `datasignals.json` and \r\n> a JSON request body instead of query parameters._\r\n> \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_data_signals(self,\r\n                         device_ids)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Parameters\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Tags | Description |\r\n|-----------|------|-------------|\r\n| deviceIds |  ``` Required ```  ``` Collection ```  | What devices to get data signals for. |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndevice_ids_value = \"[1,2,3]\"\r\ndevice_ids = json.loads(device_ids_value)\r\n\r\nresult = data_controller.get_data_signals(device_ids)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Errors\r\n\r\n| Error Code | Error Description |\r\n|------------|-------------------|\r\n| 400 | The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax. |\r\n| 401 | The request is missing a valid API key.<br> |\r\n| 403 | One of the following:<br>* The API key does not authorize access to the requested endpoint because of a missing endpoint permission.<br>* The API key does not authorize access to the requested data.
