Goodies like macro recording / playback, spell check,\ncolumn select, multiple clipboards, unlimited undo ... makes it an editor\nthat I use every day.\n\n  This project's source is at - https://github.com/pglen/pyedpro\n\n  Working and tested platforms currently are:\n\n        Win 7 .. Win 10 ...\n        Centos 6 .. 7 Ubuntu 14 ... 16 ...  20.x (should run on any linux )\n        Windows (Native) plus MSYS2, Mingw,\n        Raspberry PI 3, Raspberry PI 4, ...\n        Mac ** Some functions are disabled - in particular async processing\n\nPyedpro functions near identical on Linux / Windows / Mac / Raspberry PI\n\n Pyedpro has:\n\n            o  macro recording/play,\n            o  search/replace,\n            o  functional navigation,\n            o  comment/string spell check,\n            o  full spell check, spell suggestion dialog\n            o  auto backup,\n            o  persistent undo/redo,  (undo beyond last save)\n            o  auto complete, auto correct,\n            o\n            o  ... and a lot more.\n\n It is fast, it is extendable. The editor has a table driven key mapping.\n One can easily edit the key map in keyhand.py, and the key actions\n in acthand.py The default key map resembles gedit / wed / etp / brief\n\n[See Doxygen generated Documentation on GitHub Pages](https://pglen.github.io/pyedpro/html/)\n\n### Platforms\n\n  I mainly run it on Ubuntu, and in Win32 / MSYS2, some Fedora, Windows 10,\nand the Raspberry-Pi. It behaves consistently on all these platforms,\nit is an absolute joy to edit in a different platform without the learning\ncurve of new keystrokes.  If you want an editor  that works the same way in\nall your workspaces, PyEdPro is the one.\n\n PyEdPro now is working good on the Mac. I installed homebrew, and got it to fire up. It\nwas not a trivial exercise, as the Mac PygGOject did not do half of the stuff as the\nLinux version did. No asynchronous  anything, segmentation faults everywhere. (which python\nis not suppose to have)\n  The font rendering was messed up, but I got fixed by replacing Pango's\nget_pixel_size() with get_size() / PANGO_UNIT. [Suspect int vs float accuracy issues]\n  Some async functions like the function updater is disabled, but it can be done\nmanually. (right click on doc -> rescan) All in all the Mac's PyGobject is not a great\nsubsystem, hopefully time will be kind here.\n\n** tried the M1 ... Sun 03.Apr.2022 most of it worked; no async processing\nas Glib the timer functions bombed. Great hardware - bad PyGobject support. However\nif an editor with familiar key op is needed -- most of it works with no destructive errors.\n\n### New:\n\n    (this is extracted, use git log for up-to-date information)\n\n    Sat 10.Sep.2022 -- the system shortcuts (ctrl-s ctrl-o) are re-done by hand\n    Sat 03.Sep.2022 -- pubilshed on pip\n    Thu 21.Apr.2022 -- release issued\n    Wed 16.Mar.2022 -- dialog for read only file, export notes ... lots of other stuff\n    Wed 01.Dec.2021 -- on search, descending one dir level with Ext. Search\n    Sun 05.Sep.2021 -- made it function on the Mac M1 laptop  - !@#$$%\n\nPartial list, some highlights;\n\nAdded drag / drop source / target. New keystroke combo for keyboards\n without home / pgup etc ... Implemented html preview. Just right click on\nthe file body, an select the corresponding menu item.\n\nImplemented markdown preview. Right click ... menu\nImplemented M4 preview. The files are pulled in from the current directory (of the macro),\nand expanded with the m4 macro processor. The results than are previewed\nin an html window. (Yes, head and footer are now one file for the whole site,\nthe way it should be) Right click ... and look for: Filter to M4\n\n  Added drag and drop. Accepts file name from file manager, and accepts clipboard text.\nThe dropped content is inserted where the editor's caret is. (not where the cursor is)\nThe caret is moved to the end of insertion.\n\n This (above / below) list is an extract, please see git log for complete history.\n\n  PyEdPro now has buffer diff. Right clicking on the file's tab header presents a menu.\nOne may select the diff source, the diff destination (or target). When the source and\ntarget is selected, a diff window slides in from the right. The diff window presents\nthe diff of the two buffers, relative to 'target'. The three buffers navigate in sync,\none may inspect them and edit the source and the target. The position sync is somewhat\nintelligent by guessing the correct position of the cursor on the current buffer.\nOne can re-diff the buffers by right clicking on the tab header, and select re-diff.\nPlease note, that this diff is somewhat simple, as it marks only --del --ins points.\nAgain, its simplicity yields benefits that are surprizing. For instance; hand\nmerging small changes become more visual. And yes, it is no substitute for a real diff.\n\n The diff buffer (grayed) is read only. To refresh the diff, select\nfrom the tab's right click menu 'Re-diff buffers'. The diff-ing can be stopped from the\nsame right click menu, by selecting 'Stop Diffing'. The diff algorithm is crude, but\nthe simplicity has its advantages. Speed and predictability.\n\n  PyEdPro.py has macro recording/play, search/replace, one click function navigation,\nauto backup, undo/redo, auto complete, auto correct, syntax check, spell suggestion\n ... and a lot more.\n\n   The recorded macros, undo / redo information / editing session detail persists\n (and reloaded) after the editor is closed.\n\n The spell checker can check text, code and code comments. The parsing of the code is\nrudimentary,  comments and strings are spell checked. (Press F9) The code is filtered\nout for Python and  'C', which assures most derivative languages have correct\ncode spell code check. (.sh .php .cpp) The whole file can be checked in full text\nspell mode. Press (Shift-F9) The spell checker is executed on live text. (while typing) The\nre scan period is set to 300 millisec, an optimum between resource usage and real time feel.\n\n  Syntax highlighting. Again, a simpler parser for speed. Succeeds in its mission with\ngiving great visual candy effect without speed impact.\n\n  PyEdPro is fast, it is extendable, as python lends itself to easy extending. The\neditor has a table driven key mapping. One can easily edit the key map in\nkeyhand.py, and the key actions in acthand.py\n\n If you encounter blank screen after start, cairo is not installed. The terminal interface\nwill complain, but if you start from the GUI, you can see the message in the\nlog window. (Menu->Windows->Show_Log) To install cairo type 'sudo apt install cairo'.\n\n The default key map resembles gedit / wed / etp / brief. Full ASCII;\n Any (fixed) font can be configured. No arrangements in the program for variable pitch fonts.\n\n  See KEYS file for the list of keyboard shortcuts or press F1 in the\neditor or look at the file in pyedlib/KEYS. This file is also called up when the main menu\n Help -> 'KeyHelp In Doc' is called up.\n\n  If you highlight a word, and press F2, Zeal will open with the item searched and\nhighlighted. Shift F2 will do the same with Devhelp. This is what I use to see the API of PyGobj.\nF1 will call up the PyEdPro's help screen. Shift-F1 will open DevDocs. Naturally,\nDevdocs/Devhelp/Zeal need to be installed for these to function.\n\n  On initial start, PyEdPro shows a left pane and a top pane. The left pane\nis for function summary and the top pane is for double view of the same file.\n(to see the caller and the called [function] at once) These panes can be hidden with\nthe mouse by dragging on their handle, or by the key combination Alt-Q (Shift-Alt-Q for\nthe left pane) The first file window's settings are saved for the next startup.\n\n  PyEdPro remembers a lot about the editing session. Loaded files, cursor positions,\nfonts, font size, colors, search strings, goto numbers, undo / redo info,\nwindow positions ... and more.\n\n This is all stored in the ~/.PyEdPro directory. You may safely delete that\ndirectory to start PyEdPro with no memory of what has been done.\n\n PyEdPro also keeps a stack of original files in the ~/PyEdPro/data directory. The file\n path is treated as a name hash, so it is a flat list. For example this file is known to the\nPyEdPro hash function as '754ad753_. Under this hash name there are a multitude of items.\nThe original file, the numbered backups (from _1 to _9, circular) the undo file,\nredo file, the auto save (.sav) file, the backup file ).bak) from this session start\n... and more.\nThe way to find the file's hash is to switch buffers and the current buffer's hash\nis displayed on the status line.\n\n  Starting PyEdPro with no command line arguments will put you back to the\nprevious session, exactly where you left off. Files, positions undo-s and all.\n\n The editor will work on all PyGobject platforms, and can open UNIX and Windows files\ntransparently. It will save the file as the current platform's native CRLF\nconvention dictates. CRLF setting can also be forced.\n\n  Developer's note: in order to make PyEdPro multi platform, we save\nthe configuration info into a SQLite database in the ~/.PyEdPro directory.\nSqliteBrowser may be a tool to see what is going on.\n\n(~/ user's home directory)\n\n Contributors are welcome.\n\nThe author,\n\n      Peter Glen\n\nLatest screen shot, showing DIFF and other new features\n\n![Screen Shot of DIFF](diffscr.png)\n\nScreen from a regular session, including clip buttons ...\n\n![Screen Shot Ubuntu](screen.png)\n\nScreen from an older session, note the function list on the left:\n\n![Screen Shot More](image.png)\n\nScreen from Mac:\n\n![Screen Shot](screen_shot_mac.png)\n\n## Project stats:\n\n        Project name\n            PyEdPro\n        Generated\n            2022-04-21 13:40:49 (in 3 seconds)\n        Generator\n            GitStats (version 55c5c28), git version 2.32.0, gnuplot 5.4 patchlevel 1\n        Report Period\n            2018-09-16 00:29:10 to 2022-04-15 10:31:49\n        Age\n            1308 days, 166 active days (12.69%)\n        Total Files\n            220\n        Total Lines of Code\n            476774 (1454450 added, 977676 removed)\n        Total Commits\n            347 (average 2.1 commits per active day, 0.3 per all days)\n        Authors\n            7 (average 49.6 commits per author)\n\n\n![Stats](commits_by_year_month.png)\n\nLicense:    Open Source, FreeWare\n\n// EOF\n",
