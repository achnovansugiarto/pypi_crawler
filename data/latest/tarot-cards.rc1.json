    "description": "If running tarot cards works for you,\r\n    then it must be magic.\r\nMagic has its cost.\r\n    So, be ready.\r\nOnly if you run very few times a day,\r\n    if only it works,\r\n        then it will work.\r\nElse,\r\n    it just will not work, not for you.\r\nIn another word:\r\n    If you run many times a day,\r\n        then it will not work.\r\n    If it does not work for you,\r\n        then it just will not work, not for you.\r\nSo, while the magic embraces you,\r\n        embrace the magic.\r\n    Else,\r\n        move on, give it a try another day,\r\n        or just find magic elsewhere...\r\nWritten by Jay Yu at jyuuic2@gmail.com",
