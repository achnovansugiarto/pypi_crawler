Let this lazy script help you while reverse engineering\nbinary, cracksme challenge, or the malware your lover wrote you.\n\n### Version \n    This plugins is tested on Linux for the moment. However, nothing stop you to run it on Windows. \n\n### Requirements\n\nTo use this plugin, you will need the following:\n\n    Python 3.6 or higher\n    Python Pip (available at https://pypi.org/project/pip/)\n    OpenAI Python API (available at https://github.com/openai/openai-python)\n\n### Installation\n\n    pip install sekiryu\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this plugin, simply run the server and open the binary file you wish to analyze in your prefered decompiler. Once the binary has been loaded, you can run the plugin.\n\nThe plugin will automatically connect to the OpenAI API to perform the decompilation and analysis. Once the process is complete, the plugin will create a file with the analysed and commented pseudo-code.\n\n    To make the app work, you need to set the OpenAI API key (available at https://openai.com/api/) as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\n### Headless mode\n\n#### Ghidra\n\n    ./analyzeHeadless GHIDRA_PROJECT_DIRECTORY -import YOUR_BINARY -postscript ghidrai.py\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis plugin was created by 2ourc3 at Bushido Security as part of a research project. \n    \n#### Accuracy - What ChatGPT says\n\n    As an AI language model, I don't have a fixed percentage of accuracy in reviewing code. \n    The quality and accuracy of my responses depend on the input I receive and the knowledge I have been trained on.\n      \n    My responses are based on the patterns and information I have learned from analyzing vast amounts of text data. \n    While I am designed to provide helpful and informative responses, I may not always be able to provide a complete\n    or accurate analysis of complex code or specialized domains.\n    \n    It's important to note that my responses should be used as guidance only, and any code should be thoroughly \n    reviewed and tested by experienced developers before it is used in a production environment.\n\nFor more information about Bushido Security, please visit our website: https://www.bushido-sec.com/.\n",
