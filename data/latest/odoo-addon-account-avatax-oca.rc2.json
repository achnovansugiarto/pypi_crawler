Account information to access\nthe Avatax dashboard can be obtained through the Avalara website here:\nhttps://www.avalara.com/products/calculations.html\n\nOnce configured, the module operates in the background and performs\ncalculations and reporting seamlessly to the AvaTax server.\n\nThis guide includes instructions for the following elements:\n\n- Activating your organization's AvaTax account and downloading the product\n- Entering the AvaTax credentials into your Odoo database and configuring it\n  to use AvaTax services and features within Odoo\n\nNote: Test the module before deploying in live environment.\nAll changes to the AvaTax settings must be performed by a user with\nadministrative access rights.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT - resolving name conflict with Odoo EE**\n\nAvatax support was added to Odoo EE 14 and 15.\nUnfortunately the module names used are the same as the OCA ones,\nand because of this name collision the OCA modules were forced to change name.\n\nThe main module was renamed from ``account_avatax`` (now used by Odoo EE) to\n``account_avatax_oca``.\n\nTo apply this change in your odoo database and continue using the OCA Avalara certified\nconnector:\n\n  1. Ensure you have the latest version from the OCA, and you see ``account_avatax_oca``\n       in your Apps list.\n  2. Install the new ``account_avatax_oca`` module\n  3. Unistall the ``account_avatax`` module\n  4. Confirm that your configurations were kept safe, in particular:\n       Avatax API, \"Avatax\" default Fiscal Position, and \"Avatax\" default Tax record.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBefore installing the Avatax app, the Avalara Python client\nmust be installed in your system.\nIt is available at https://pypi.org/project/Avalara.\n\nTypically it can be installed in your system usin ``pip``::\n\n    pip3 install Avalara\n\nThe base app, ``account_Avatax``, adds Avatax support to Customer Invoices.\nInthe official app store: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/account_avatax/\n\nThe ``account_avatax_sale`` extension adds support to Quotations / Sales Orders.\nInthe official app store: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/account_avatax_sale/\n\nIn most cases you will want to download and install both modules.\n\nTo install the Avatax app:\n\n- Download the AvaTax modules\n- Extract the downloaded files\n- Upload the extracted directories into your Odoo module/addons directory\n- Log into Odoo as an Administrator and enable the Developer Mode, in 'Settings'\n- Navigate to 'Apps', select the 'Update Apps List' menu, to have the new apps listed.\n- In the Apps list, search for 'AvaTax'\n- Click on the Install button. If available, the ``account_avatax_sale`` module will\n  also be installed automatically.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure an Odoo company to use Avatax, follow these steps.\nNote tha tsome of them might be configured out of the box\nfor the Odoo default company.\n\n1.
