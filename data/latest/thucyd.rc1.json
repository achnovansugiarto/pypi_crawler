This subpackage is ready. \n\nAdditional subpackages will include `filter_reference` and `filters`, with an expected rolling delivery through 2020.\n\n\n## Package Installation\n\nThe two package hosts for `thucyd` are [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/thucyd/) and [Conda-Forge](). The packages are identical and the only difference is the means of delivery. From PyPi, use `pip`,\n\n```bash\n$ pip install thucyd\n```\n\nand from Conda-Forge use `conda`:\n\n```bash\n$ conda install -c conda-forge thucyd\n```\n\nOnce installed, the package is importable to Python:\n\n```python\n>>> import thucyd\n```\n\n**Note: At this time the conda-forge package is not yet available.**\n\nA quick example call to the `eigen` subpackage would be\n\n```python\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> Vor, Eor, signs, _, _ = thucyd.eigen.orient_eigenvectors(np.eye(3).dot(np.diag([1., -1., 1.])), np.diag(np.arange(3)[::-1]))\n>>> Vor\narray([[1., 0., 0.],\n       [0., 1., 0.],\n       [0., 0., 1.]])\n>>> signs\narray([ 1., -1.,  1.])\n```\n\n\n## Package Dependency\n\nThe only dependencies `thucyd` has at this time is on [python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and [numpy >= 1.14](https://www.numpy.org/). \n\n\n## Why `thucyd`\n\n[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) was the first Western writer and historian who applied scientific principles to the recording of Western history. Although Herodotus, who predates Thucydides by less than a generation, started the transformation away from the epic poetry enshrined by Homer to a more objective record, it was Thucydides who engaged in inquiry and cross validation of all accounts in his History of the Peloponnesian Wars.\n\nThe `thucyd` package honors the great historian by delivering implementations of eigenanalysis and signal-processing analytics that have been thoroughly researched and validated, and continues the tradition of inquiry by focusing on all the ways that rigorous eigen- and signal-processing theories can be applied to the financial markets and other machine-learning disciplines. \n\n\n## Buell Lane Press\n\n[Buell Lane Press](https://buell-lane-press.co) is the package sponsor.",
