CB_IPO is a library that will fetch information on recent and historical IPOs by scraping the SEC EDGAR database for S-1 filings. These queries can also be modified to search for certain dates, and additional forms. This data can subsequently be placed in a pandas dataframe for the sake of easy viewing. A second proccess this autmoates is finding the specific 10-K filings for a company. By inputing a cik, a list of 10-k filing links will be returned. With these links, the library also has a function for using a 10-k link and returning a list of info such as assets, liabilities, and income.\n\n## Installation\n`CB_IPO` can be installed via PyPi by running:\n```\npip install CB_IPO\n```\n\n## Quick Start\nTo use `CB_IPO` instantiate an instance by calling \n```\ninstance = scrape()\n``` \n\nTo adjust search date ranges run (Dates in YYYY-MM-DD)\n```\ninstance.set_search_date(START, END)\n```\n\nTo add form types to the search run\n```\ninstance.add_forms(['S-1','10-K'])\n```\n\nTo get a dataframe with all companies filing within the specified paramateres and filing dates run\n\n```\ninstance.generate_df(Number of entries per page, number of pages)\n```\n\nTo get a list of links to 10-K filings by a company given CIK\n```\ninstance.create_links(cik, number of files needed)\n```\n\nTo scrape a 10-K link for assets, liabilities, and Net Income run\n```\ninstance.scrape_xbrl(link)\n```\n## Details\nThis project is a pure python project using modern tooling. It uses a `Makefile` as a command registry, with the following commands:\n- `make`: list available commands\n- `make develop`: install and build this library and its dependencies using `pip`\n- `make build`: build the library using `setuptools`\n- `make lint`: perform static analysis of this library with `flake8` and `black`\n- `make format`: autoformat this library using `black`\n- `make annotate`: run type checking using `mypy`\n- `make test`: run automated tests with `pytest`\n- `make coverage`: run automated tests with `pytest` and collect coverage information\n- `make dist`: package library for distribution\n\n\n",
