    "description": "## Description\nA micropython library to decode PPM signals coming from a RC receiver (as used for rc planes and drones).\n\nThis library is focused on savety and includes functions that can be used to detect a faulty or lost signal.\n**For this it is required to init the PpmReader class with the correct number of channels in the PPM signal. This might be a different number than the amount of servo connectors on the RC receiver hardware!**\n\nCreated for the use with pi pico, but should work on other boards as well.\nYou can find the [API documentation](https://github.com/redoxcode/micropython-ppm_reader/#API) and a few [examples](https://github.com/redoxcode/micropython-ppm_reader/#Examples) below.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Print the values of all channels\n```Python\nfrom ppm_reader import PpmReader\nppm_pin_id=28\nppm_channels=8\nppmReader=PpmReader(ppm_pin_id,ppm_channels)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print(ppmReader.get_values())\n```\n### Find the number of channels\n```Python\n#the number of channels should be known before you init PpmReader\n#if the channel number is incorrect only guess_channel_count will work\nfrom ppm_reader import PpmReader\nppm_pin_id=28\nppmReader=PpmReader(ppm_pin_id,channels=0)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print(ppmReader.guess_channel_count())\n```\n### Find values for min_value and max_value\n```Python\n#move the controls to the extreme positions and observe the values\nfrom ppm_reader import PpmReader\nppm_pin_id=28\nppm_channels=8\nppmReader=PpmReader(ppm_pin_id,ppm_channels)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print(ppmReader.get_raw_values())\n```\n### Check for a loss of signal\n```Python\nfrom ppm_reader import PpmReader\nppm_pin_id=28\nppm_channels=8\nppmReader=PpmReader(ppm_pin_id,ppm_channels)\n\n#wait initial connection with the remote\nwhile ppmReader.get_valid_packets() == 0:\n    print(\"waiting for connection ...\")\n    time.sleep(0.5)\nprint(\"connected.\")\n\n#got signal, continue to main loop\nwhile True:\n    last_packet_time=ppmReader.time_since_last_packet()\n    print(last_packet_time)\n    if last_packet_time>25000: \n        #25ms without a new packet\n        #take security measures here (for example stop all motors)\n        print(\"connection lost\")\n        #wait for connection\n        while ppmReader.time_since_last_packet()>25000:\n            pass\n        print(\"connected again\")\n    else:\n        #connection ok. Do something here\n        print(ppmReader.get_values())\n```\n\n## API\n### class PpmReader(pin_id,channels,min_value=1000,max_value=2000,packet_gap=4000)\n- pin_id: GPIO pin connected to the PPM signal comming from the RC receiver.\n- channels: Number of channels in the PPM signal. if the channel count is wrong the packts will be considered invalid.       \n- min_value: Minimum timeframe per channel in us (this should be around 1000us for standard equipment).\n- max_value: Minimum timeframe per channel in us (this should be around 2000us for standard equipment).   \n- packet_gap: Minimum time gap between packets in us (4000us should be used for standard equipment).\n\n```time_since_last_packet()```\n- returns the time passed since the last valid packet arrived in us. This will stay below about 5000us if every packet is received correctly. Missing 2 or 3 packets is usually not a problem.\n\n```get_valid_packets()```\n- returns the number of valid packets received\n\n```get_inalid_packets()```\n- returns the number of invalid packets received\n    \n```reset_packet_counters()```\n- resets counters for valid and invalid packets received\n    \n```get_raw_values()```\n- returns a list of all raw timeframes in us in the last valid packet received\n\n```get_raw_value(channel)```\n- returns the raw timeframe in us in the last valid packet received for a given channel\n- channel: channel to get the value from\n\n```get_values()```\n- returns a list of all values in the last valid packet maped to a range of 0.0 to 1.0 (values are not clipped)\n\n```get_value(channel)```\n- the value for a given channel in the last valid packet maped to a range of 0.0 to 1.0 (values are not clipped)\n- channel: channel to get the value from\n\n```get_values_bi()```\n- returns a list of all values in the last valid packet maped to a range of -1.0 to 1.0 (values are not clipped)\n\n```get_value_bi(channel)```\n- the value for a given channel in the last valid packet maped to a range of -1.0 to 1.0 (values are not clipped)\n- channel: channel to get the value fro\n\n\n```guess_channel_count()```\n- returns the number of channels in the last packet (incase you are not sure how many channels your signal has)\n",
