    "description": "======\nengine\n======\n\nWhat is engine?\n===============\n\nengine is a collection of tools for processing a queue. It provides an API to\ndefer a callable and run it later. engine also provides process helpers to\nset up a safe environment for clearing different kind of queues.\n\nHow to use engine?\n==================\n\nThe basic usage of engine is to defer something to execute later. However, the\ninternals are written in such way to allow for planning. You can plan your\ncode to use a queue, but a queue doesn't even need to be present. Lets take a\nlook at an example::\n\n    >>> import engine\n    >>> def hello_world():\n    ...     print \"hello world\"\n    \n    >>> engine.defer(hello_world)\n    hello world\n\nAs you can see above, the function ``hello_world`` was executed immediately.\nThis is because, by default, engine will use the ``DummyQueue`` which will\nexecute the given callable when put on the queue.\n\nIf you have a queue such as stompserver, ActiveMQ or any STOMP compliant\nqueue you can use ``StompQueue``. Lets take a look at an example::\n\n    >>> import engine\n    >>> def hello_world():\n    ...     print \"hello world\"\n    \n    >>> engine.defer(hello_world, queue=engine.StompQueue())\n\nThe above code will now defer the call to ``hello_world`` by sending it to the\nqueue.\n\nYou can define the default queue used by engine. To do this you should use\n``engine.configure``. Here is an example changing the default queue from\n``DummyQueue`` to ``StompQueue``::\n\n    >>> import engine\n    >>> engine.configure(queue=engine.StompQueue())\n\nNow all calls to ``engine.defer`` will use the ``StompQueue`` instance.",
