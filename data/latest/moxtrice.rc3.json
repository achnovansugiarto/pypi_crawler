    "description": "# Moxtrice\n\nA simple tool to synchronize between moxfield.com and cockatrice\n\n# Installation\n\nClont it and `pip install .` or simply\n\n```\npip install moxtrice\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nTo get started, simply run the following command:\n```\nmoxtrice\n```\nBy default, Moxtrice will download all public lists for the default user [(me)](https://www.moxfield.com/users/Facet) into the current directory. You can override this by specifying a different username:\n```\nmoxtrice --config.usernmae Yourname\n```\nMoxtrice will create a config file if you don't already have one. The config file looks like this:\n\n```\ndecks:\n- rMUqj1P1FEibzEFgpKqtSA\n- uIbk-vrQjkaxqo_be_FFnQ\n- -u5QNxgKb0uaU9t8vzztig\n- C5hPo-DBXEa1uoibleNyTg\n- jOPwBWIhokyYe8sjfcG3fA\n- 3-GvVXtlgkWPmarhFwxphg\n- Upa29gKDwES3C9InEcPUzw\n- F8tbsl4bT0ObYoJyPQGyyA\n- 6KIIGaY0G0ek6Dauhj5y-g\nusername: facet\n```\nWhere the code are the string follows \"https://www.moxfield.com/decks/\" in your decklist url.\n\nAll synchronized lists are those defined in decks and all public decks from the specified user. This allows you to follow others and stay up to date.\n\nTo change the directory where the downloaded decks are saved, use the following command:\n```\nmoxtrice --deckpath \"path/to/yourdirectory\"\n```\n\n# Configuration\n\nYou can modify the config file to change various settings, such as the username and the list of decks to synchronize. For example:\n\n```\ndecks:\n- rMUqj1P1FEibzEFgpKqtSA\n- C5hPo-DBXEa1uoibleNyTg\n- Upa29gKDwES3C9InEcPUzw\nusername: Yourname\n```\n\nthe config file named `.moxtrice.yml` in your home directory(\"C:/Users/username\" in Windows and \"/home/usernmae\" in unix-like).\n\n# Cautions\n\n- Formats other than commander are supported, but they have not been thoroughly tested.\n- Some dual-faced/transformed card names may be inconsistent between moxtrice and cockatrice.\n- Currently, only public lists are supported because moxtrice's API is not public and we cannot really \"login\". According to [moxfield's FAQ](https://www.moxfield.com/help/faq#moxfield-api), this could be implemented if this project gets more attention and satisfies moxfield's requirements.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nMoxtrice would not be possible without the following resources:\n\n- [moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/)\n- [cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/)\n- [MTG-TO-XMage](https://github.com/thebear132/MTG-To-XMage)\n",
