    "description": "# pylook\n\nData analysis tools for rock mechanics experiments in the spirit of the legacy XLook tool.\n\nWe follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) practice. That means that while the\npackage is 0.X (as it is currently) we may be changing the API as design constraints and\ndecisions are reached. We won't break your code for fun, but we also won't burden users for\nthe next decade to maintain a bad design decision that was made. When you see a version\nnumber like 0.a.b it means that a is a feature release and b is a bug fix only release.\n\nWe only support Python 3 and you should too! It's not hard to switch from Python 2, has\nmassive performance improvements, and is regularly updated.\n\n## Contributing\n**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.\n\nThere may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready to be\nan open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What\ncould you possibly offer a project like this one?\n\nWe assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at all,\nyou can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source projects is a fantastic\nway to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer\n(that would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making mistakes, and\nlearning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.\n\nBeing an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can help out by\nwriting documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the project (and yes - that\nincludes giving feedback about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be\nthe most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh\neyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.\n\nFor more information, please read the see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/leemangeophysicalllc/pylook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Philosophy\nData processing should have an audit trail - what did you do to the raw data to get to where\nyou are when the data are published? This not only helps find and eliminate and errors, but\nalso allows others in the future to reprocess the data with new techniques or query the raw\ndata for some other purpose that you may never have thought of! If we only archive our\nprocessed data and do not document what happened to it - that utility is gone. It is your\nreponsibility as a researcher, likely funded by public funds, to make that data yeild every\nounce of useful information it can. That includes making it useful for others in the future!\n\nPyLook is growing to replace the tool \"XLook\" developed by Chris Marone and others as the\nprimary tool for processing data from the experimental rock mechanics field. XLook is a very\nfast and versatile tool that had its own syntax for performing math and other operations. It\ncan work with the proprietary binary format common to several labs as well as simple ASCII\ntext. Python allows us to leverage modern tools and signal processing libraries as well as\nseamlessly pass data to data science tools.\n\nWhat about your legacy files? Don't worry, your \"r files\" (short for reduction files) will\nstill work. You can still run the old experiments in the modern tools, but with the idea that\nnew experiments can be reduced in pure Python. We have provided examples of both!\n\n## What Can't PyLook Do\nQuite a bit actually. We've got the basics for simple double direct shear experiments and a\nfew other functions, but there is plenty to do. We need to implement the rest of the XLook\nsyntax commands and continue to add more functionality! Rate and state inversion is also\nhigh on the list.\n\n## Thank You\nA big thank you to Unidata's Python team for much of the excellent contributing and README\ntext templates and for their efforts to maintain the scientific Python stack. All projects\nbenefit from standing on the shoulders of these and the many other tireless volunteers and\nsupportive companies.\n\n\n",
