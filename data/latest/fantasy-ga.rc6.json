    "description": "# fantasy-ga\n**fantasy-ga** is a Python module and a command line tool that uses the genetic algorithm to automate the generation of fantasy sports linesups. Currently supported platforms and leagues are as follows. \n\n\n|   | NBA | NFL  | MLB  | NHL  |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| DraftKings  |  ✅  | ✅  |  ✅  |  ✅  |\n| FanDuel |   |   |   |   |\n\n## Installation\nDependencies: `numpy`\n```bash\npip install fantasy-ga\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Python\n`LineupGenerator` class supports csv files exported from daily fantasy sports platforms for a given contest.\n\n```python\nfrom fantasy_ga import LineupGenerator\nfrom fantasy_ga.configs import Site, League, ModelConfig, ContestConfig\n\ndata_path = \"examples/DraftKings/NBA/DKSalaries.csv\"\nexport_path = \"examples/DraftKings/NBA/export.csv\"\n\ncc = ContestConfig(Site.DK, League.NBA)\nmc = ModelConfig(\n    # initial population of random lineups\n    n_pop = 1000\n    # number of evolutions to itererate breeding and mutation for\n    n_gen = 16\n    # number of children lineups to choose from two best lineups\n    n_breed = 30\n    # number of random mutations for each evolution\n    n_mutate = 30\n    # number of compound evolutions with additional random lineups\n    n_compound = 5\n)\n\nmodel = LineupGenerator(cc, mc)\nmodel.read_csv(data_path)\nmodel.fit()\n# If top_n is not specified, it will save max(500, number of total lineups) lineups sorted by scores\nmodel.export_csv(export_path, top_n=3)\n\nlineups, scores = model.get_top_n_lineups(1)\nprint(\n    f\"\"\"\n    [Best Lineup]\n    Players: {[model.id_to_name[id] for id in lineups[0]]} \n    Salary Total: {sum([model.id_to_salary[id] for id in lineups[0]])}\n    Expected FPTS: {scores[0]}\n    \"\"\"\n)\n```\n### Using custom `numpy.array` for player data\nAlternatively, you can provide a `numpy.array` where the first 3 columns correspond to player ID, salary, fantasy points (FPTS), followed by position information. For instance, the columns correspond to `id,salary,fpts,PG,SG,SF,PF,C,G,F,UTIL` for DraftKings Fantasy Basketball. \n\nIf you would like to use custom numpy array for data matrix instead of csv files, you can do so by using the `set_matrix()` method. For example\n\n```Python\ncc = ContestConfig(Site.DK, League.NBA)\nmc = ModelConfig() # use default\nm = np.array(\n    [\n        [0, 6600, 36.46503, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n        [1, 4200, 26.760368, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n        [2, 3000, 4.38538, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [3, 5000, 27.175564, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [4, 3400, 16.734577, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n        [5, 5900, 3.4382372, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n        [6, 3000, -0.18490964, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [7, 3000, 11.075589, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n        [8, 3000, 6.469783, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [9, 3000, 8.459954, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [10, 5700, 33.98281, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    ]\n)\nmodel = LineupGenerator(cc, mc)\nmodel.set_matrix(m)\nmodel.fit()\n```\n\n### Running individual steps of the Genetic Algorithm\n`LineupGenerator` class has two core methods which return optimised lineups. `breed()` method chooses the best two lineups according to the sum of fantasy points with valid positions and swap players randomly (creating _children_ lineups). `mutate()` method randomly swaps players where applicable. `fit()` method wraps around those methods such that those operations are done for multiple generations with additional random lineups.\n\n### CLI\n\nAs a Python module\n```\n$ python -m fantasy_ga --data_path=examples/DraftKings/NBA/DKSalaries.csv --export_path=examples/DraftKings/NBA/lineups.csv --site=DraftKings --league=NBA --n_pop=100 --n_gen=5 --n_breed=100 --n_mutate=100 --n_compound=10 --top_n_lineups=3\n```\nor a CLI command\n```\n$ fantasy-ga --data_path=examples/DraftKings/NBA/DKSalaries.csv --export_path=examples/DraftKings/NBA/lineups.csv --site=DraftKings --league=NBA --n_pop=100 --n_gen=5 --n_breed=100 --n_mutate=100 --n_compound=10 --top_n_lineups=3\n```\nwhich generates\n```\nSaved top 3 lineups into \"examples/DraftKings/NBA/lineups.csv\".\n\n[Best Lineup]\nPlayers: ['Reggie Jackson', 'Max Strus', 'Anthony Edwards', \"Royce O'Neale\", 'Nikola Jokic', 'Dejounte Murray', 'John Collins', 'Jarrett Allen']\nSalary Total: 50000\nExpected FPTS: 268.13\n```\n",
