    "description": "# Pmail\n\nSimple TUI mail client for Gmail.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPmail aims to be a usable, terminal based client for Googles Gmail service\nPmail is built on top of the Gmail API, using python, hence the p.\nPmail is supposed to integrate well with other terminal utilities, it uses\n[W3m][2] for parsing emails, [Vim][3] ([Neovim][4]) for editing and composing\nemails and integrates [fzf][5] for fuzzy finding email addresses and as a file\npicker for choosing attachments.\nAs of now I haven't tested with other programs in place of\nthese but in principle it should be possible to use other programs in their\nplaces.\n\nThe motivation to develop Pmail comes from a growing frustration with getting\n[Mutt][6] and the related msmpt/offlineimap configuration functional.\n\nPmail does not aim to implement all features available through the API, the\ncurrent set of features is listed below.\nOf course Pmail is heavily inspired\nby [Mutt][6] but aims to be a much simpler more usable client for Gmail users.\n\n### Obligatory screenshot\n\n![screenshot][screenshot]\n\n## Features\n\n- Send, receive, reply, forward emails.\n- Keyboard driven interface with vimish bindings.\n- Lightweight.\n- View emails using W3m.\n- Compose emails with Vim.\n- Fuzzy search through contacts using fzf, no need for an address book.\n- Sort messages according with Gmails label system.\n- Manipulate labels easily. (mark as read, move to trash, etc..)\n- Separate client and server programs.\n\nPmail implements a client/server pair. The server is supposed to be run in the\nbackground (for example via a systemd service) and it serves two purposes.\nFirst it is supposed to keep a local database containing information about the\nusers mailbox in sync with the remote version kept by Google.\nSecond, it handles all database related functionality for the client.\nThe advantage of this is it allows the use of a sqlite database \nsince concurrency issues can be handled between different threads of the same\nprogram quite easily using Lock objects from pythons threading module. \nThe local database is not a full copy of the remote inbox, it only stores \ninformation contained in the header fields of the emails (more or less).\nIf you want to read an email then it must be downloaded and so a network\nconnection is required.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\nAt the moment Pmail is still in development and still has a few issues but it\nneeds testing. If you would like to test it out you should follow the following\ninstructions.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nYou will also need to install W3m, vim and fzf if you wish to use all the\nfeatures of Pmail.\nYou will also require the following python packages:\n\n    google-api-python-client \n    google-auth-httplib2 \n    google-auth-oauthlib\n    sqlalchemy\n\nThese can be installed with pip or however else you like to install python\nmodules.\n\n\n### Setup Gmail API\n\n(Instructions valid as of July 2020.) You will need to do this step for each\naccount you wish to use.\n\n1. Go to the [Quickstart guide][1] and click on the 'Enable the Gmail API\nbutton.\n2. Agree to the terms and conditions, select 'Desktop App' if it asks you for\nthe type of application and finally click the 'Download client configuration\nbutton at the end.\n3. Save the `credentials.json` file somewhere safe.\n\n#### Setup Gmail PubSub (optional)\n\nThis is an optional step which is only needed if you wish to enable push/pull\nupdate notifications via GClouds PubSub interface. See [here][7] for detailed\ninstructions about how to set this up.\n\nIn summary what you need to do is this:\n\n1. Install the pubsub client:\n\n    pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub\n\n   You will need to create authentication credentials for the pubsub client,\n   follow the instructions [here][8]. Save the resulting `credentials.json`\n   file somewhere safe.\n\n2. Create a pubsub topic called `pmail` for the project which is associated\n   with API (if you followed the quickstart guide, this will be called\n   something like `quickstart-xxxxxxxxxxxxx`) \n3. Create a subscription alled `pmail-update`, set the delivey type to `pull`.\n4. Grant publish privileges to `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com`.\n\n### Install Pmail\n\n#### Method 1: Using pip (recommended)\n\nRun the following command:\n\n    pip install pmail-tui\n\n#### Method 2: Clone this repo\n\nMake sure you have all of the dependencies installed and then:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/lt20kmph/pmail\n\n#### Method 3: From the AUR\n\nNot supported yet\n\n### Configure\n\nPmail looks for config files in the following locations in order of\npreference:\n\n    $HOME/.config/pmail/config.yaml\n    ../config.yaml\n\nTo copy the included example config file to `$HOME/.config/pmail/config.yaml`\nrun the following:\n\n    python -m pmail --mk-config\n\nYou can safely ignore most of the configuration options but you will need to\nfill out your relevant details in the accounts section.\n\n**For the pubsub to work (optional)** you will **need** to fill in the\nrelevant settings with the authentication and project name.\n\nAlso you might need to change `nvim` to `vim` under `editor` depending on your\npreference.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nFirst we need to start the server. Run Pmail in server mode: \n\n    python -m pmail -m server\n\nIf everything is working, a Google window will open up (or a link will appear\nin your terminal) asking you to confirm the relevant permissions. At this\npoint you may have to find the advanced options to 'allow unsafe apps'. If\neverything went successfully after a few minutes (or longer, depending on how\nmuch history you are syncing, controlled by the 'sync_from' option in the\nconfig file) you should have synced a local copy of your mailbox and then you\ncan start Pmail in client mode, in a separate terminal window: \n\n    python -m pmail -m client\n\nThe client should start up and you should see a list of your messages, and you\ncan start deleting/sending/forwarding emails.\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nUse the arrow keys or j/k to scroll up and down through the message list.\nYou can also use PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN keys to scroll faster.\nThe selected email is highlighted as you scroll.\nThe following key bindings are available.\n\n    RETURN - Read the selected email\n    r - Reply\n    f - Forward an email\n    a - Reply to group/Reply to all\n    m - Compose a new email\n    v - View attachments\n    dd - Move mail to trash and mark as read\n    dt - Move mail to trash but do not read\n    dr - Mark as read but leave in the inbox\n    ll - Toggle label visibility on and off\n    lu - Show messages with unread label\n    li - Only show messages with inbox label (default)\n    ls - Show messages with sent label\n    lt - Show messages in the trash\n    / - Do a search\n    c - Clear search filter\n    SPACE - Select email (can be used to select multiple emails)\n    TAB - Switch between accounts if you have more than one configured\n    b[n] - Switch to nth mailbox, for n in [1,..,9]\n    bu - Start unified mailbox mode\n    gg - Go to top of message list\n    G - Go to bottom of message list\n    CTRL U - Scroll up one page\n    CTRL D - Scroll down one page\n    H - Move cursor to first visible messsage\n    M - Move cursor to central visible message\n    L - Move cursor to last visible message\n    q - Quit\n\nBefore finally sending an email a confirmation screen will be shown. On this\nscreen various options are available, but they are presented on the interface.\nOn the attachments screen, you can either press 'q' to quit or 's' to save the\nattachment to your downloads directory in the configuration file.\n\n## Notes\n\nYou can choose how much history you want to sync up by setting the\nassociated value in the configuration file.\n\nWhen a search is executed a list of matching messages is retrieved directly from\nGoogle - not by querying the local database - and the corresponding message\ninformation is added to the local database. \nThis is probably not ideal - it means if you do a search with a large amount of\nmatches it can be quite slow and it can cause your local database to grow quite\nallot.\nOn the other hand if you want to increase the amount of historical messages with\ninformation stored locally you can just do a search for 'newer_than:4y', where\n'4y' is any time period you like.\nThe search is compatible with any keyword search exactly the same as the usual\nGmail searching capabilities and hence its quite powerful.\n\npmail can also be run with a flag '-n' and an account id.  When run like this\npmail will return an int corresponding to the number of unread mails in the\nmail box of the account corresponding to the id provided.\n\nFor example, if you had the following in your `config.yaml`:\n\n    accounts:\n        yourname@gmail.com:\n            id: 'ID'\n            name: 'Wonderful Person'\n            credentials: 'credentials.json'\n\nthen running:\n\n    python -m pmail -n ID \n\nwould return the number of unread mails in the mailbox for\n`yourname@gmail.com`. This is potentially useful for scripts.\n\n### Attachments\n\nIn order to correctly (more or less) detect which messages have attachments,\nwhen pmail is first run, it will create a new hidden label called `ATTACHMENT`\nwhich it will add to all existing messages with attachments and also create a\nfilter which will add this label to all new incoming messsages with\nattachements. This means that pmail will display the attachments icon on any\nmessages which have the paperclip icon in the gmail web interface.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU OWN SECURITY. Keep your credentials.json file\nsomewhere safe, possibly encrypted.\nAfter the first run, Pmail stores a token.pickle file this file\nconfirms that you have agreed to give permission to Pmail to send and modify\nemails. \nAlso keep this file safe.\nCommunications between the server and client parts of the program is incredibly\nprimitive and no form of encryption is currently implemented. Therefore, do no\nattempt to run the client/server over any network you do not completely trust\n\n## Limitations and TODO\n\n- [ ] There are some strange bugs which need to be investigated.\n- [ ] Handle searches with large number of results differently.\n- [ ] Improve error handling and logging (partially done, but can still be\n    improved). \n\n[1]: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python\n[2]: http://w3m.sourceforge.net/\n[3]: https://www.vim.org/\n[4]: https://neovim.io/\n[5]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n[6]: http://www.mutt.org/\n[screenshot]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lt20kmph/pmail/master/scrot.png \"Screenshot\"\n[7]: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push \n[8]: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries",
