    "description": "This tool has been forked from at [GitHub](https://github.com/agronholm/sqlacodegen)\nPython 3 and the latest SQLAlchemy version).  \n  \nThis is a tool that reads the structure of an existing database and generates  \nthe appropriate SQLAlchemy model classes, using the declarative style if  \npossible.  \n  \n  \nFeatures  \n========  \n  \n* Supports SQLAlchemy  \n* Produces declarative code that almost looks like it was hand written  \n* Produces [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) compliant code  \n* Accurately determines relationships, including many-to-many, one-to-one  \n* Automatically detects joined table inheritance  \n* Excellent test coverage  \n* It creates each SQLAlchemy class file separately under the ``\"models\"`` folder.  \n  \n  \nUsage instructions  \n==================  \n  \nInstallation  \n------------  \n  \nTo install, do:\n  \n \n\n> pip install husrev\n\nor, failing that:\n  \n\n>  easy_install husrev\n\n  \nExample usage  \n-------------  \n  \nAt the minimum, you have to give husrev a database URL.  \nThe URL is passed directly to SQLAlchemy's  \n`create_engine() method so please refer to` SQLAlchemy's documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html>\nfor instructions on how to construct a proper URL.  \n  \nExamples:\n  \n >husrev postgresql:///some_local_db --noinflect\n\n >husrev mysql+oursql://user:password@localhost/dbname\n\n >husrev sqlite:///database.db  \n\nTo see the full list of options:\n >husrev --help\n\n  \nModel class naming logic  \n------------------------  \n  \nThe table name (which is assumed to be in English) is converted to singular  \nform using the \"inflect\" library. Then, every underscore is removed while  \ntransforming the next letter to upper case. For example, ``sales_invoices``  \nbecomes ``SalesInvoice``.  \n\nUse ``--noinflect`` disable inflect transform.\n  \nRelationship detection logic  \n----------------------------  \n  \nRelationships are detected based on existing foreign key constraints as  \nfollows:  \n  \n* **many-to-one**: a foreign key constraint exists on the table  \n* **one-to-one**: same as **many-to-one**, but a unique constraint exists on  \n  the column(s) involved  \n* **many-to-many**: an association table is found to exist between two tables  \n  \nA table is considered an association table if it satisfies all of the  \nfollowing conditions:  \n  \n#. has exactly two foreign key constraints  \n#. all its columns are involved in said constraints  \n  \n  \nRelationship naming logic  \n-------------------------  \n  \nRelationships are typically named based on the opposite class name.  \nFor example, if an ``Employee`` class has a column named ``employer`` which  \nhas a foreign key to ``Company.id``, the relationship is named ``company``.  \n  \nA special case for single column many-to-one and one-to-one relationships,  \nhowever, is if the column is named like ``employer_id``. Then the  \nrelationship is named ``employer`` due to that ``_id`` suffix.  \n  \nIf more than one relationship would be created with the same name, the  \nlatter ones are appended numeric suffixes, starting from 1.  \n  \n  \nSource code  \n===========  \n  \nThe source can be browsed at [GitHub](https://github.com/MMustafa53/husrev)\n  \nReporting bugs  \n==============  \n  \nA [bug tracker](https://github.com/MMustafa53/husrev/issues)\nis provided by GitHub.",
