    "description": "urlblocks\n=========\n\n`urlblocks` is the module provided URL string class which can be operated as a constructor, consisting of some blocks - URL components.\n\nThis is the fork of `zacharyvoase/URLObject project <https://github.com/zacharyvoase/urlobject>`__\nbut with several key changes and new functionality:\n\n-  Following `PEP-20, the zen of Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`__, errors should never pass silently. To comply with this standard, invalid URLs, such as empty, hostless or schemeless now got denied.\n-  Domains manipulation support.\n-  Additional helpers (such as manipulations with trailing slashes) are available.\n\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install urlblocks\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nComing soon.\n\n\n\n(Un)license\n===========\n\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this\nsoftware, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,\ncommercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors of this\nsoftware dedicate any and all copyright interest in the software to the public\ndomain.
