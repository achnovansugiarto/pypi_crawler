    "description": "# Welcome to WARden implementation for Specter Server\n\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pxsocs/specter_warden.svg)](https://GitHub.com/pxsocs/specter_warden/releases/)\n[![Open Source? Yes!](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20Source%20%3F/Yes%21/blue?icon=github)](https://GitHub.com/pxsocs/specter_warden/releases/)\n[![Powered by NGU](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-NGU%20Technology-orange.svg)](https://bitcoin.org)\n\nThis is a light weight version of the original WARden designed for integration with Specter Server.\n\nTransactions will be imported automatically from Specter.\n\nThis app was built with a couple of goals:\n\n- Easily track portfolio values in fiat (private requests through Tor)\n- Monitor Wallets and Addresses for activity using your own node and notify user.\n- Track your full node status\n\n> warden (wɔːʳdən )\n> A warden is responsible for making sure that the laws or regulations are obeyed.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Please note that the WARden needs to be installed at the same machine running Specter Server.\n\nInstallation instructions for Specter can be found [here](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop).\n\nLog in to your computer running Specter, open Terminal and type:\n\n```bash\npip3 install alphazeta.warden\n```\n\n_You may need to allow port 25442 (this is the port WARden uses to connect):_\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 25442\n```\n\nThen run the WARden server:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m warden\n```\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to:\n`http://localhost:25442/`\n\n## Upgrade\n\nFrom the WARden directory, type:\n\n```bash\n pip3 install alphazeta.warden --upgrade\n```\n\n## This is an Open Source project\n\n[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)\n\nWe believe Open Source is the future of development for bitcoin. There is no other way when transparency and privacy are critical.\n\nThe code is not compiled and it can be easily audited.\n\n### Sats for Features\n\nAs interest for the app grows and if the community contributes, new features will be added like:\n. Import of other transactions\n. Editing of transactions\n. Enhanced statistics - volatility, compare performance, heatmaps, ...\n. Specter implementation without MyNode\n. Email notifications\n. And suggested improvements\n\nBut the app is also open source so anyone can contribute. Anyone looking to contribute / get a bounty is welcome.\n\n## Privacy\n\nMost portfolio tracking tools ask for personal information and may track your IP and other information. Our experience is that even those who say they don't, may have log files at their systems that do track your IP and could be easily linked to your data.\n\n### Why NAV is important?\n\nNAV is particularly important to anyone #stackingsats since it tracks performance relative to current capital allocated.\nFor example, a portfolio going from $100 to $200 may seem like it 2x but the performance really depends if any new capital was invested or divested during this period. **NAV adjusts for cash inflows and outflows.**\n\n## NAV Tracking\n\nNAV tracks performance based on amount of capital allocated. For example, a portfolio starts at $100.00 on day 0. On day 1, there is a capital inflow of an additional $50.00. Now, if on day 2, the Portfolio value is $200, it's easy to conclude that there's a $50.00 profit. But in terms of % appreciation, there are different ways to calculate performance.\nCB Calculates a daily NAV (starting at 100 on day zero).\nIn this example:\n\n| Day | Portfolio Value\\* | Cash Flow  | NAV | Performance |\n| --- | ----------------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- |\n| 0   | \\$0.00            | + \\$100.00 | 100 | --          |\n| 1   | \\$110.00          | + \\$50.00  | 110 | +10.00% (1) |\n| 2   | \\$200.00          | None       | 125 | +25.00% (2) |\n\n> - Portfolio Market Value at beginning of day\n>   (1) 10% = 110 / 100 - 1\n>   (2) 25% = 200 / (110 + 50) - 1\n\nTracking NAV is particularly helpful when #stackingsats. It calculates performance based on capital invested at any given time. A portfolio starting at $100 and ending at $200 at a given time frame, at first sight, may seem like is +100% but that depends entirely on amount of capital invested\nalong that time frame.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n> If you get a message telling you that pip is not installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get -y install python3-pip\n```\n\n> If you get a message that git was not found:\n\n```bash\n\nsudo apt-get install git\n```\n\n**Please note that this is ALPHA software. There is no guarantee that the\ninformation and analytics are correct. Also expect no customer support. Issues are encouraged to be raised through GitHub but they will be answered on a best efforts basis.**\n\n\n",
