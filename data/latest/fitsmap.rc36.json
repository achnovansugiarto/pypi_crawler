Examining images of this size can be difficult, especially in multiple\nbands. Memory constraints and highly specialized tools like DS9 can make simple\nhigh-level analysis infeasible or cumbersome. FitsMap addresses these two issues\nby converting large fits files and images into tiles that can be presented using\n`LeafletJS <https://leafletjs.com>`_. Another issue in examining survey images\nis examining a catalog of sources in the context of the images. FitsMap\naddresses this by converting a catalog of sources into JSON map markers, which\ncan be viewed in the webpage. Additionally, these sources are searchable using\nthe web interface by the column ``id``.\n\nSome sample websites that leverage FitsMap are:\n\n- `DREaM Galaxy Catalogs <https://purl.org/fitsmap/dream>`_ `(Drakos, et al., 2022) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac46fb>`_\n- `Morpheus <https://purl.org/fitsmap/morpheus>`_ `(Hausen & Robertson 2020) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab8868>`_\n\nAdditional examples are welcome! If you'd like to add your use case here, submit\nan issue with the title \"Use Case Example\", and in the description, include the\nURL to the FitsMap along with a title and also a link to an associated paper if\nyou'd like.\n\n\nHere is an example using FitsMap to render a 32,727² image and ~33 million\nsources from the `DReAM Galaxy Catalog <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10703>`_:\n\n.. image:: docs/dream_map.gif\n    :alt: FitsMap\n    :align: center\n\nInstallation\n************\n\nRequirements:\n\n- ``astropy``\n- ``cbor2``\n- ``click``\n- ``mapbox_vector_tile``\n- ``matplotlib``\n- ``numpy``\n- ``pillow``\n- ``scikit-image``\n- ``ray``\n- ``tqdm``\n\nUse ``pip`` to install\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install fitsmap\n\nUsage\n*****\n\nFitsMap is designed to address the following example. A user has multiple FITS\nfiles or PNG files that represent multiple bands of the same area of the sky,\nalong with a catalog of sources within that area. For example, the directory\nmight look like:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n  - path/to/data/\n    - F125W.fits\n    - F160W.fits\n    - RGB.png\n    - catalog.cat\n\nThere are two FITS files (``F125W.fits``, ``F160W.fits``), a PNG file\n(``RGB.png``), and catalog (``catalog.cat``) containing sources visible in the\nimage files. To render these files using FitsMap you can use\n|dir_to_map| or |files_to_map|.\n\nAfter the FitsMap has been generated you can view it in your web browser by\nnavigating to the directory containing the map (``index.html``) and running the\nfollowing command in the terminal:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    fitsmap serve\n\nThis will start up a webserver and open your browser to the page containing the\nmap. When your done with the map you can close your browser window and kill the\nprocess running in the terminal.\n\n\n``dir_to_map``\n--------------\n\nTo convert this directory into a FitsMap using |dir_to_map|:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from fitsmap import convert\n\n    convert.dir_to_map.(\n        \"path/to/data\",\n        out_dir=\"path/to/data/map\",\n        cat_wcs_fits_file=\"path/to/data/F125W.fits\",\n        norm_kwargs=dict(stretch=\"log\", max_percent=99.5),\n    )\n\nThe first argument is which directory contains the files that we would like to\nconvert into a map. In our case, this is ``path/to/dir``.  The next argument is\nthe ``out_dir`` keyword argument that tells FitsMap where to put the generated\nwebpage and supporting directories. In this example, the website will be built\nin a new subdirectory called ``map`` within ``path/to/data``. The argument\n``cat_wcs_fits_file`` keyword argument tells FitsMap which header to use to\nparse any catalog files and convert them into map markers. The ``norm_kwargs``\nargument should be a dictionary of kwargs that get passed to\n`astropy.visulization.simple_norm\n<https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.visualization.mpl_normalize.simple_norm.html>`_\nwhich is used to scale the FITS files before rendering.\n\nEquivalently, using the FitsMap command line interface:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n  fitsmap dir --out_dir /path/to/data/map \\\n              --cat_wcs_fits_file \"path/to/header_file.fits\" \\\n              path/to/data\n\n**Note:** The command line interface doesn't currently support ``norm_kwargs``.\n\nRun ``fitsmap --help`` for more information\n\n\nOnce FitsMap is finished, the following will have been generated:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n  - path/to/data/map/\n    - F125W/\n    - F160W/\n    - RGB/\n    - catalog/\n    - css/\n    - catalog_assets/\n    - imgs/\n    - js/\n    - index.html\n\nThe directories ``F125W``, ``F160W``, ``RGB``, ``catalog`` contain tiled\nversions of the input fits files. The ``css`` directory contains some supporting\nCSS files for clustering the markers and rendering pixels. The ``imgs``\ndirectory contains supporting images. The ``js`` directory contains supporting\nJavaScript for the map. ``catalog_assets`` contains JSON files for each source\nin each that are rendered when the marker associated with that source is\nclicked. Finally, ``index.html`` is the webpage that contains the map.\n\nTo use the map, run ``fitsmap serve`` in the same directory as ``index.html``\n\n\n``files_to_map``\n----------------\n\nIf you want to specify the files that get used to generate the map you can use\nfunction |files_to_map|:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from fitsmap import convert\n\n    paths_to_files = [\n        ...,\n    ]\n\n    convert.files_to_map.(\n        paths_to_files,\n        out_dir=\"path/to/data/map\",\n        cat_wcs_fits_file=\"path/to/header_file.fits\",\n        norm_kwargs=dict(stretch=\"log\", max_percent=99.5),\n    )\n\nThis will produce a map in ``out_dir`` using the files that were passed in using\nthe ``paths_to_files`` variable.\n\n\nFile Specific ``norm_kwargs``\n-----------------------------\n\nThe ``norm_kwargs`` argument to |dir_to_map| and |files_to_map| can be a\ndictionary of kwargs where the keys are the filenames (not paths) and the values\nare the ``simple_norm`` kwargs for that file. For example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from fitsmap import convert\n\n    paths_to_files = [\n        \"fits_images/F125W.fits\",\n        \"fits_images/F160W.fits\",\n    ]\n\n    convert.files_to_map.(\n        paths_to_files,\n        out_dir=\"path/to/data/map\",\n        cat_wcs_fits_file=\"path/to/header_file.fits\",\n        norm_kwargs={\n            \"F125W.fits\":dict(stretch=\"log\", max_percent=99.5),\n            \"F160W.fits\":dict(stretch=\"log\", max_percent=99.9, min_percent=0.1),\n        }\n    )\n\n\nSaveable Views\n**************\n\nFitsMap stores the current view (location/zoom) in the url. You can then\nshare the view with others by sharing the url.\n\n\nSearch\n**************\n\nYou can search the catalogs by the ``id`` column from the catalog and FitsMap\nwill locate and pan to the source in the map.\n\n\nParallelization\n**********************************\n\nFitsMap supports the parallelization(via `ray <ray.io>`_) of map creation in two\nways:\n\n- splitting images/catalogs into parallel tasks\n- parallel tiling of an image\n- parallel reading/tiling of a catalog\n\nThe settings for parallelization are set using the following keyword arguments:\n\n- ``procs_per_task``: Sets how many layers/catalogs to convert in parallel at a\n  time.\n- ``task_procs``: How many processes can work on a single task.\n\nYou can use both keyword arguments at the same time, but keep in mind the number\nof CPUs available. For example, if ``procs_per_task=2`` and ``task_procs=2``\nthen that will generate 6 new processes, 2 new processes for each task, and each\nof those will generate 2 new processes to tile an image in parallel.\n\nParallelization can offer a significant speed up, so if there are cores available\nit makes sense to use them.\n\n**NOTE: ray's support for Windows is currently in beta, so you may experience\nsome bugs running in parallel on Windows machines. Feel free to submit an issue\nif you run into any problems.**\n\nNotes\n*****\n\nNotes on Image Conversion\n-------------------------\n\nFITS images are rendered into PNG map tiles using Matplotlib colormaps. The\ndefault colormap used when rendering tiles is \"gray\". This can be changed by\nsetting the value of ``convert.MPL_CMAP`` to any valid `Matplotlib colormap\n<https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html>`_.\n\nTo ensure that pixels are rendered correctly and that map markers are placed\ncorrectly, any image that is not square is squared by padding the array with NaN\nvalues that are converted into transparent pixels in the PNG. As a consequence,\nif a FITS file contains NaNs when it is converted, those pixels will be\nconverted into transparent pixels.\n\nNotes on Catalog Conversion\n---------------------------\n\nCatalogs should be delimited text files with the first line containing the\ncolumn names, and the following lines containing values. Catalogs need to have\nan ``id`` column with a unique value for each row. It also needs to have\ncoordinates for each source, which can be one of the following pairs of columns\n(``ra`` / ``dec``) or (``x`` / ``y``). **Note fitsmap assumes that the origin of\nthe image starts at (1,1), but this can be changed to (0,0) by setting the\nkwarg** ``catalog_starts_at_one=False``.\n\nSome catalogs have many columns for each row, which will create very tall\npop-ups when the markers are clicked. To avoid this, you can pass an integer\nvalue using ``rows_per_column`` to either |dir_to_map| or |files_to_map|. This\nwill break the information into ``rows_per_column`` sized columns.\n\nCatalog pop-ups are rendered as a simple HTML table, so you can put any HTML\nfriendly things, for example <img> tags, in the catalog and they should be\nrendered appropriately.\n\nFitsMap will render your markers as Ellipses if you have the following columns\nin your catalog: ``a``, ``b``, and ``theta``. Where ``a`` is the major axis\nradius in **pixels**, ``b`` is the minor axis radius in **pixels**, and theta\nis the rotation of the ellipse in units of degrees starting from the negative\nx-axis and moving counter-clockwise.\n\n.. image:: docs/ellipse_fig.png\n    :alt: EllipseOrientaton\n    :align: center\n\n----\n\nIf you use FitsMap in your research please cite it using the following (also in\n`CITE.bib <https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap/blob/master/CITE.bib>`_):\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    @article{hausen2022a,\n         title = {FitsMap: A simple, lightweight tool for displaying interactive astronomical image and catalog data},\n       journal = {Astronomy and Computing},\n        volume = {39},\n         pages = {100586},\n          year = {2022},\n          issn = {2213-1337},\n           doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2022.100586},\n           url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133722000257},\n        author = {R.

As the scale of astronomical image and catalog data continues to grow, visualizing the data becomes increasingly difficult. In this work, we introduce FitsMap, a simple, lightweight tool for visualizing astronomical image and catalog data. FitsMap uses well-understood image tiling techniques and a novel catalog tiling technique to serve gigapixel images with catalogs containing tens of millions of sources using only a simple web server. Further, the web-based visualizations can be viewed performantly on mobile devices. FitsMap is implemented in Python and is open source (https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap).}\n    }\n\n\n\nFor more information see the `docs <https://fitsmap.readthedocs.io>`__\nor the `code <https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap>`__.\n\n\n",
