    "description": "# goodmock - A Good Mock Library for Python\n\nThis repository is for activate development of goodmock.\n\n## _Disclaimer_\n_This module makes no claims of mock magic, but it's good_\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAll source code for this project is located in goodmock.py\n\n### Prerequisites\n\ngoodmock relies on features introduced in [PEP 612](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/), and only supports Python 3.10+\n\n### Installation\n\n_PyPi_: TODO\n\n_Manual Installation:_ navigate to the root directory of the project and run `python -m pip install .`\n\n### How to use goodmock\n\nGiven a class definition like:\n\n```python\nclass ClassA:\n    def method(int i) -> int: ...\n```\n\nYou can set a return value for a class method:\n\n```python\nclassa_mock = Mock.of(ClassA)\nMock.when(classa_mock.method).takes(1).returns = 2\n\nassert classa_mock.method(1) == 2\n```\n\nOr you can set an expected exception for a class method:\n\n```python\nclassa_mock = Mock.of(ClassA)\nMock.when(classa_mock.method).takes(1).raises = Exception()\n\nwith pytest.raises(Exception):\n    classa_mock.method(1)\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Need help?\n\n* For more examples see the [unit tests](https://github.com/SchuylerGoodman/goodmock/test)\n* File an issue via [Github Issues](https://github.com/SchuylerGoodman/goodmock/issues)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.\n",
