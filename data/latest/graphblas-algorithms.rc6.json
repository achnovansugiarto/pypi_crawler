We are trying to target the NetworkX API algorithms where possible.\n\n### Installation\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge graphblas-algorithms\n```\n```\npip install graphblas-algorithms\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nFirst, create a GraphBLAS Matrix.\n\n```python\nimport graphblas as gb\n\nM = gb.Matrix.from_coo(\n  [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3],\n  [1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2],\n  [1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.],\n  nrows=4, ncols=4, dtype='float32'\n)\n```\n\nNext wrap the Matrix as `ga.Graph`.\n\n```python\nimport graphblas_algorithms as ga\n\nG = ga.Graph(M)\n```\n\nFinally call an algorithm.\n\n```python\nhubs, authorities = ga.hits(G)\n```\n\nWhen the result is a value per node, a `gb.Vector` will be returned.\nIn the case of [HITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm),\ntwo Vectors are returned representing the hubs and authorities values.\n\nAlgorithms whose result is a subgraph will return `ga.Graph`.\n\n## Plugin for NetworkX\n\nDispatching to plugins is a new feature in Networkx 3.0.\nWhen both `networkx` and `graphblas-algorithms` are installed in an\nenvironment, calls to NetworkX algorithms can be dispatched to the\nequivalent version in `graphblas-algorithms`.\n\n### Dispatch Example\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport graphblas_algorithms as ga\n\n# Generate a random graph (5000 nodes, 1_000_000 edges)\nG = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(5000, 0.08)\n\n# Explicitly convert to ga.Graph\nG2 = ga.Graph.from_networkx(G)\n\n# Pass G2 to NetworkX's k_truss\nT5 = nx.k_truss(G2, 5)\n```\n\n`G2` is not a `nx.Graph`, but it does have an attribute\n`__networkx_plugin__ = \"graphblas\"`. This tells NetworkX to\ndispatch the k_truss call to graphblas-algorithms. This link\nconnection exists because graphblas-algorithms registers\nitself as a \"networkx.plugin\" entry point.\n\nThe result `T5` is a `ga.Graph` representing the 5-truss structure of the\noriginal graph. To convert to a NetworkX Graph, use:\n```python\nT5.to_networkx()\n```\n\nNote that even with the conversions to and from `ga.Graph`, this example still runs 10x\nfaster than using the native NetworkX k-truss implementation. Speed improvements scale\nwith graph size, so larger graphs will see an even larger speed-up relative to NetworkX.\n\n### Plugin Algorithms\n\nThe following NetworkX algorithms have been implemented\nby graphblas-algorithms and can be used following the\ndispatch pattern shown above.\n\n- Boundary\n  - edge_boundary\n  - node_boundary\n- Centrality\n  - degree_centrality\n  - eigenvector_centrality\n  - in_degree_centrality\n  - katz_centrality\n  - out_degree_centrality\n- Cluster\n  - average_clustering\n  - clustering\n  - generalized_degree\n  - square_clustering\n  - transitivity\n  - triangles\n- Community\n  - inter_community_edges\n  - intra_community_edges\n- Core\n  - k_truss\n- Cuts\n  - boundary_expansion\n  - conductance\n  - cut_size\n  - edge_expansion\n  - mixing_expansion\n  - node_expansion\n  - normalized_cut_size\n  - volume\n- DAG\n  - ancestors\n  - descendants\n- Dominating\n  - is_dominating_set\n- Isolate\n  - is_isolate\n  - isolates\n  - number_of_isolates\n- Link Analysis\n  - hits\n  - pagerank\n- Reciprocity\n  - overall_reciprocity\n  - reciprocity\n- Regular\n  - is_k_regular\n  - is_regular\n- Shortest Paths\n  - floyd_warshall\n  - floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance\n  - single_source_bellman_ford_path_length\n  - all_pairs_bellman_ford_path_length\n  - has_path\n- Simple Paths\n  - is_simple_path\n- S Metric\n  - s_metric\n- Structural Holes\n  - mutual_weight\n- Tournament\n  - is_tournament\n  - score_sequence\n  - tournament_matrix\n- Triads\n  - is_triad\n",
