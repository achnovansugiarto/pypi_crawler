Tested with Ubuntu + Windows 7.\n\n2011-09-06\n++++++++++\n\n- `Cleanup <http://www.falatic.com/index.php/39/pinging-with-python>`_ by Martin Falatic : \n  - Restored lost comments and docs. Improved functionality: constant time between pings, internal times consistently use milliseconds. Clarified annotations (e.g., in the checksum routine)\n  - Using unsigned data in IP & ICMP header pack/unpack unless otherwise necessary.\n  - Signal handling\n  - Ping-style output formatting and stats\n\n2011-08-03\n++++++++++\n\n- Ported to py3k by Zach Ware. Mostly done by 2to3; also minor changes to deal with bytes vs. string changes (no more ord() in checksum() because >source_string< is actually bytes, added .encode() to data in send_one_ping()). That's about it.\n\n2010-03-11\n++++++++++\n\n- Changes by Samuel Stauffer:\n  - Replaced time.clock with default_timer which is set to time.clock on windows and time.time on other systems.\n\n2009-11-08\n++++++++++\n\n- Fixes by `George Notaras <http://www.g-loaded.eu/2009/10/30/python-ping/>`_, reported by `Chris Hallman <http://cdhallman.blogspot.com>`_: \n  - Improved compatibility with GNU/Linux systems.\n  - Re-use time.time() instead of time.clock(). The 2007 implementation worked only under Microsoft Windows. Failed on GNU/Linux. time.clock() behaves differently under the two `OSes <http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.clock>`_.\n\n2007-06-30\n++++++++++\n\n- Little rewrite by `Jens Diemer <http://www.python-forum.de/post-69122.html#69122>`_:\n  - Change socket asterisk import to a normal import\n  - Replace time.time() with time.clock()\n  - Delete \"return None\" (or change to \"return\" only)\n  - In checksum() rename \"str\" to \"source_string\"\n\n2000-12-04\n++++++++++\n\n- Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.\n\n1997-12-16\n++++++++++\n\nFor some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the bytes always and then do an htons().\n\n1997-11-22\n++++++++++\n\nInitial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only put in what I need now.\n",
