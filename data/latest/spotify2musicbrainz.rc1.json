    "description": "Spotify2MusicBrainz\n===================\n\nAn aid to add information from Spotify to MusicBrainz_.\n\n.. _MusicBrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nSpotify has a lot of music. Like, a lot a lot. But due to Spotify's\ninterface, it can be a bit clunky to use userscripts on the web site,\nand there's no way to hook into the desktop or mobile app interfaces.\n\nThe script uses the API and command-line interface to hopefully make it\na bit easier to copy information from Spotify into the MusicBrainz\ndatabase, while also including information that isn't actually being\nshown in any of the public phasing Spotify interfaces (such as\nbar codes).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSpotify2MusicBrainz can be installed using ``pip`` on most platforms, like so::\n\n  pip install spotify2musicbrainz\n  spotify2musicbrainz\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThere are currently no tests. :(\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe project is still in its very early stages. Feel free to submit PRs,\nbut please adhere to code style and respect that not all the project\ngoals have been fully fleshed out yet, so your patch may not be in line\nwith the author's vision.\n\nCode style\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe script will have a strict adherence to PEP8_, with the exception of\nthe line length. It is nice to stay under the 72/79 characters per line,\nbut not an absolute necessity.\n\n.. _PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n\nCommits\n^^^^^^^\n\nCommits going into the master branch should strive to be\n`atomic commits`_ with `good commit messages`_.\n\n.. _atomic commits: https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/\n.. _good commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n\nContact\n-------\n\nThe project is hosted on GitLab, and any bugs, feature requests, etc.\nshould go there: https://gitlab.com/Freso/spotify2musicbrainz\n\nThe project lead can also be found as \"Freso\" on `Freenode IRC`_,\nmainly in the #metabrainz and #musicbrainz channels.
