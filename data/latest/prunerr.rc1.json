Which download\nitems are considered eligible for deletion is configured by the user.  The common case\nis that download items that are currently imported are not considered for deletion.\nNeither are items from private trackers/indexers that have been upgraded or otherwise\ndeleted from the library but haven't met the indexers seeding requirements.  The order\nin which download items are deleted is determined according to rules configured by the\nuser.  The common case is to delete items from public indexers first and among those to\ndelete the items with the highest ratio first to preserve the health of the community by\nseeding less popular items longer.  Next delete items from private indexers by\nconfigured indexer priority and within the items for a given indexer to delete items in\nan order to maximize ratio and/or seeding rewards.\n\nOther configured operations may be applied as well.  For example:\n\n- Verify and resume corrupt items\n- Increase bandwidth priority for items from private indexers\n- Decrease bandwidth priority for items from public indexers\n- Remove and blacklist download items containing archives (``*.rar``, ``*.zip``,\n  ``*.tar.gz``, etc.) which can't be perma-seeded\n- Remove and blacklist stalled download items\n- etc.\n\nThe ``$ prunerr`` command is intended to serve as a companion to the `Servarr`_ suite of\napplications and services and the `Transmission BitTorrent client`_.  It periodically\npolls the `download clients`_ of `Sonarr`_, `Radarr`_, etc. and applies the configured\noperations to the download items in each of those download clients.  It can also be run\nindependently of any Servarr instances to optimize seeding for download items added by\nother means, e.g. `FlexGet`_.\n\nSee the `Usage`_ section below for full details.\n\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\nInstall using any tool for installing standard Python 3 distributions such as `pip`_::\n\n  $ sudo pip3 install prunerr\n\nOr use `the Docker image`_.  See `the example ./docker-compose.yml file`_ for usage\ndetails.\n\n\n*****\nUsage\n*****\n\nStart by writing your ``~/.config/prunerr.yml`` configuration file.  See the comments in\n`the example configuration`_ for details.\n\nOnce configured, you may run individual sub-commands once, run all operations once as\nconfigured using the ``$ prunerr exec`` sub-command, or run all operations in a polling\nloop using the ``$ prunerr daemon`` sub-command.  See the `Order of Operations`_ section\nfor a detailed description of the operations.  Use the CLI help to list the other\nsub-commands and to get help on the individual sub-commands::\n\n  $ prunerr --help\n  $ prunerr exec --help\n\nSet the ``DEBUG`` environment variable to ``true`` to get verbose details and help\nunderstand what Prunerr is doing::\n\n  $ DEBUG=true prunerr exec\n\n\n*******************\nOrder of Operations\n*******************\n\nNote that polling is required because there is no event we can subscribe to that\nreliably determines disk space margin *as* the download clients are downloading.  Every\nrun of the ``$ prunerr exec`` sub-command or every loop of the ``$ prunerr daemon``\nsub-command performs the following operations.\n\n#. Verify and resume corrupt items, same as: ``$ prunerr verify``.\n\n#. Review download items, same as: ``$ prunerr review``:\n\n   Apply per-indexer review operations as configured under ``indexers/reviews`` in the\n   configuration file to all download items.\n\n#. Move download items that have been acted on by Servarr to the ``*/seeding/*``\n   directory, same as: ``$ prunerr move``.\n\n   As Servarr acts on completed download items, be that importing files from them,\n   ignoring them, deleting them from the queue, etc., Prunerr moves those items from the\n   Servarr download client's ``Directory`` to a parallel ``*/seeding/*`` directory.\n   Then when deleting download items to free space, Prunerr only considers items under\n   that directory.  This has the added benefit of reflecting which items have been acted\n   on by Servarr in the download client.\n\n#. Delete download items if disk space is low, same as: ``$ prunerr free-space``.\n\n   Consider items for deletion in different groups in this order:\n\n   #. Download items no longer registered with tracker.\n\n      IOW, items that can no longer be seeded at all first.\n\n   #. Orphan files and directories not belonging to any download item\n\n      Walk all the top-level directories used by each download client and identify which\n      paths don't correspond to a download client item.\n\n   #. Imported/seeding download items\n\n      IOW, download items that have been acted upon by Servarr and moved to the\n      ``*/seeding/*`` directory by the ``$ prunerr move`` sub-command/operation\n      excluding those items filtered out according to the ``indexers/priorities``\n      operations with ``filter: true``.  For example, don't delete currently imported\n      items (by hard link count) or items that haven't met private indexer seeding\n      requirements.\n\n   For each of these groups in order, loop through each item in the group and:\n\n   #. Check disk space against the margin configured by\n      ``download-clients/max-download-bandwidth`` and\n      ``download-clients/min-download-time-margin``\n\n   #. If there's sufficient disk space, remove any bandwidth limits set previously and\n      continue to the next operation if any.\n\n   #. Otherwise, delete the item.\n\n   If there's still not enough disk space after going through all the groups, then stop\n   downloading by setting the download bandwidth limit to ``0``.  IOW, keep seeding, but\n   no more downloading until a future ``$ prunerr free-space`` run is able to free\n   sufficient space.\n\n   For the orphans group, delete smaller items first to minimize the amount of\n   re-downloading needed should the user notice and correct any issues resulting in the\n   orphans.\n\n   For the other groups delete items in the order determined by the configured\n   ``indexers/priorities`` indexer order then by the configured operations for that\n   item's indexer.\n\n\n************\nCONTRIBUTING\n************\n\nNOTE: `This project is hosted on GitLab`_.  There's `a mirror on GitHub`_ but please use\nGitLab for reporting issues, submitting PRs/MRs and any other development or maintenance\nactivity.\n\nSee `the ./CONTRIBUTING.rst file`_ for more details on how to get started with\ndevelopment.\n\n\n**********\nMotivation\n**********\n\nI didn't like the available options I could find at the time for maximizing seeding from\na lovingly managed media library.  Deleting by a ratio threshold doesn't make sense to\nme because that can delete items when there's plenty of disk space.  Also the ratio\nthreshold is a reverse indicator for items from private indexers vs items from public\nindexers.  Items from private indexers with high ratios should be kept around as long as\npossible to build user total ratio whereas items from public indexers with low ratios\nshould be kept around as long as possibility to preserve access in the\ncommunity/ecosystem.  Finally, deleting any item still imported in the Servarr just\nbecause it hit the ratio threshold is the biggest waste since it doesn't free any space.\nSo I wrote Prunerr to prune download items in the correct order.\n\nFinally, there is a laundry list of other download client management tasks that can be\nautomated but aren't by anything I could find.  So I added them to Prunerr as well.\n\n\n.. _`Transmission BitTorrent client`: https://transmissionbt.com/\n\n.. _`Servarr`: https://wiki.servarr.com\n.. _`Radarr`: https://wiki.servarr.com/en/radarr\n.. _`Sonarr`: https://wiki.servarr.com/en/sonarr\n.. _`download clients`: https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/settings#download-clients\n.. _`FlexGet`: https://flexget.com/\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/\n\n.. _the Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/merpatterson/prunerr\n.. _`the example ./docker-compose.yml file`: https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/prunerr/blob/master/docker-compose.yml\n\n.. _`the example configuration`:\n   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/prunerr/blob/master/src/prunerr/home/.config/prunerr.yml\n\n.. _`This project is hosted on GitLab`:\n   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/prunerr\n.. _`a mirror on GitHub`:\n   https://github.com/rpatterson/prunerr\n\n.. _`the ./CONTRIBUTING.rst file`:\n   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/prunerr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n",
