    "description": "Upraise\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n**Upraise** is a thin web application framework.\r\n\r\n*Note:* I consider Upraise outdated. Don't use it anymore. It came into\r\nexistence as a package of common code I redundantly had in my Web applications.\r\nHowever, meanwhile Werkzeug_ provides a great WSGI library that I use as a basis\r\nfor simple framework layers in my applications. Check it out and dump Upraise ASAP.\r\n\r\nIt is based on WSGI (see :PEP:`333` for more information) and utilizes the\r\nPaste_ library. This allows it to be deployed in various ways, including CGI,\r\nFastCGI, SCGI, mod_wsgi and as standalone HTTP server.\r\n\r\nThis is not a full-stack framework that requires specific external components to\r\nbe used with. Instead, any desired component should be easy to integrate into\r\nUpraise, including template engines (e.g. Genshi_, Mako_, or `Jinja 2`_),\r\ndatabase abstraction layers/ORMs (e.g. SQLAlchemy_), URL dispatchers (e.g.\r\nRoutes_, selector_, or Upraise's own, very simple dispatcher), authentication\r\nand authorization mechanisms (e.g. AuthKit_, or barrel_), i18n toolkits (e.g.\r\nBabel_) or whatever other component one might wish to make use of. Not to\r\nmention lots of WSGI middlewares that are available, although spread over\r\nmultiple packages and sometimes redundant.\r\n\r\nUpraise provides a basic, flexible framework that does require some better\r\nunderstanding of the components desired to be used, but comes without the\r\noverhead and maybe unsatisfying preselection that full-stack frameworks like\r\nTurboGears_, Django_ and, although to a lesser extent, Pylons_ imply.\r\n\r\n.. _Werkzeug: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/\r\n\r\n.. _Paste: http://pythonpaste.org/\r\n\r\n.. _Genshi: http://genshi.edgewall.org/\r\n.. _Mako: http://www.makotemplates.org/\r\n.. _Jinja 2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/\r\n.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/\r\n.. _Routes: http://routes.groovie.org/\r\n.. _selector: http://www.lukearno.com/projects/selector/\r\n.. _AuthKit: http://authkit.org/\r\n.. _barrel: http://www.lukearno.com/projects/barrel/\r\n.. _Babel: http://babel.edgewall.org/\r\n\r\n.. _TurboGears: http://turbogears.org/\r\n.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/\r\n.. _Pylons: http://pylonshq.com/",
