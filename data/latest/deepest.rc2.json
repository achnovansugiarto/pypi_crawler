    "description": "﻿\n=======\ndeepest\n=======\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/markgollnick/deepest.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/markgollnick/deepest\n    :alt: Build Status\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/markgollnick/deepest/badge.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/markgollnick/deepest?branch=master\n    :alt: Coverage Status\n\n|\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markgollnick/deepest/master/deep.jpg\n    :alt: Diavik Diamond Mine, Canada\n\n..\n\n    *“There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the\n    world.”*\n\n    *— Gandalf, from “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”, by\n    J.R.R. Tolkien*\n\n**deepest** — A cross-platform (and cross-language) command-line utility used\nto determine the maximum depth of the current (or a specified) directory tree.\n\nAvailable in both Python and C++ flavors (via the `ShedSkin`_ libraries).\n\n.. _ShedSkin: https://code.google.com/p/shedskin/\n\n\nRationale\n---------\n\n*   Needed a way to determine how close a project was getting to the\n    8-subdirectory limit defined by ISO-9660.\n\n*   Needed a way to determine how close to ``MAX_PATH`` directories were\n    getting.\n\n    *   ``MAX_PATH`` is defined as 260 characters on Windows: 3 for the drive\n        (``C:\\``), 1 for the terminating ``NULL`` character at the end, and 256\n        for directories, back-slashes, filenames, and extensions in the middle.\n\n*   “Yes, but… Why Python?”\n\n    *   It’s faster for prototyping. (Bias… I’m just more familiar with it.)\n    *   It gave me an excuse to try out `ShedSkin`_. :-)\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Python >= 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\n* ShedSkin >= 0.9.3, 0.9.4 — *optional*\n* g++ >= 4.6.2 or clang++ >= 3.2 — *optional*\n* MinGW/MSYS (2012-04-26 catalog) — *optional*\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**Python (Users)**::\n\n    pip install deepest\n\n**Python (Developers)**::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:markgollnick/deepest.git\n    cd deepest\n    python setup.py build install\n    # Alternatively...\n    make python\n    pip install dist/deepest-*.tar.gz\n\n**C++**:\n\n1.  Download and install `ShedSkin`_ (`instructions`_).\n2.  Run the following::\n\n        ./3to2  # Make some minor adjustments for ShedSkin compatibility\n        cd deepest  # This is the dir INSIDE the project's root dir\n        shedskin deepest.py\n        make\n        # Alternatively, from the project's root dir...\n        make cpp\n\n.. _instructions: https://code.google.com/p/shedskin/wiki/docs#Installation\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n**Python:**\n\nOnce installed, you can use it as a script…\n\n::\n\n    $ deepest .\n    breadth of dirs examined    longest pathname    deepest directory\n                          13                  58                    7\n\n    longest file: ./workspace/dwarves/digging/deep/deeper/deepest/balrog.log\n    deepest path: ./workspace/some/really/long/directory/chain/here\n\n…or, you can use it as a library::\n\n    >>> import deepest\n    >>> deepest.get_depth('c:\\\\workspace')\n    ('c:\\\\workspace\\\\some\\\\really\\\\long\\\\directory\\\\chain\\\\here', 7)\n    >>> deepest.get_length('c:\\\\workspace')\n    ('c:\\\\workspace\\\\dwarves\\\\digging\\\\deep\\\\deeper\\\\deepest\\\\balrog.log', 59)\n\n**C++:**\n\nOnce compiled, it is a (notably faster) alternative to the Python script::\n\n    $ deepest c:\\\\workspace\n    breadth of dirs examined    longest pathname    deepest directory\n                          13                  59                    7\n\n    longest file: c:\\workspace\\dwarves\\digging\\deep\\deeper\\deepest\\balrog.log\n    deepest path: c:\\workspace\\some\\really\\long\\directory\\chain\\here\n\n\nSpeed\n-----\n\nIn a project containing well over 5000 directories with a max depth of 13, the\nPython and C++ versions (compiled with clang-503.0.40) were pitted against each\nother. Both versions were run three times each on a Late 2013 Mac Book Pro.\n\nThese are the averaged results::\n\n    $ time deepest  # Python script\n    ...\n    real    0m0.423s\n    user    0m0.244s\n    sys     0m0.160s\n\n    $ time deepest  # C++ binary\n    ...\n    real    0m0.169s\n    user    0m0.063s\n    sys     0m0.101s\n\nIn practical observation, using the compiled C++ version may gain you anywhere\nfrom a 10% to a whopping 60% boost in speed. :-)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nBoost Software License, Version 1.0: <http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt>\n",
