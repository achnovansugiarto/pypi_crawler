See the \n  [CAPASM Assembler language description](CAPASM.md) for details.\n* *ncas* which implements language elements to facilitate the assembly of\n  source code written for the *karma* assembler. The *karma* assembler\n  was used by HP for the development of the HP-75 system ROMs. See the \n  [NCAS Assembler language description](NCAS.md) for details.\n\nIn addition, the CAPASM suite provides tools to post-process the assembled\nobject files to LEX, LIF image or ROM files in order to use the assembled\nfiles in emulators or \"real\" hardware.\n\nThe CAPASM software is entirely written in Python3 and was successfully \ntested on LINUX, macOS and Windows 10.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSee the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/bug400/capasm/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.\n\n\nAssemble files\n--------------\n\nThe *lex85* subdirectory of this repository contains the sample HP-85 LEX file ftoc.asm from the HP-83/85 Assembler ROM manual. To assemble this file type:\n\n        capasm ftoc.asm\n\nThis assembles the file *ftoc.asm* and creates a binary object file *ftoc.bin*. Any error messages are printed to the terminal.\n\nTo get a list file type:\n\n        capasm ftoc.asm -l ftoc.lst\n\nThis creates a list file *ftoc.lst* with the default symbol table. To get a symbol table with a cross-reference use the *-r 2* option:\n\n        capasm ftoc.asm -l ftoc.lst -r 2\n\nNote: The default base of addresses in the list file is octal.\n\nIf not specified, the name of the binar object file is the name of the source file with the extension *.bin*. You can specify a different binary object file name with the *-b* option:\n\n        capasm ftoc.asm -l ftoc.lst -b result.bin -r 2\n\nThe *ncas* assembler is called in the same way. The default base for addresses in\n*ncase* assembly list files is hexadecimal. The *lex75* subdirectory contains\nsample assembler source files for *ncas*.\n\n\nCAPASM Assembler command line parameters\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou get a description of the command line parameters if you type:\n\n        capasm -h\n\n```\nusage: capasm [-h] [-b BINFILE] [-l LISTFILE] [-g GLOBALSYMBOLFILE]\n              [-r {0,1,2}] [-p PAGESIZE] [-w WIDTH] [-c] [-x]\n              [-s {6,7,8,9,10,11,12}]\n              sourcefile\n\nAn assembler for the Hewlett Packard Capricorn CPU (Series 80 and HP-75)\n\npositional arguments:\n  sourcefile            source code file (required)\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -b BINFILE, --binfile BINFILE\n                        binary object code file (default: sourcefilename with\n                        suffix .bin)\n  -l LISTFILE, --listfile LISTFILE\n                        list file (default: no list file)\n  -g GLOBALSYMBOLFILE, --globalsymbolfile GLOBALSYMBOLFILE\n                        global symbol file. Use either the built-in symbol\n                        table names {\"85\",\"87\",\"75\",\"none\"} or specify a file\n                        name for a custom table (default: none)\n  -r {0,1,2}, --reference {0,1,2}\n                        symbol reference 0:none, 1:short, 2:full\n  -p PAGESIZE, --pagesize PAGESIZE\n                        lines per page (default:66)\n  -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH\n                        page width (default:80)\n  -c, --check           activate additional checks\n  -d DEFINE, --define DEFINE\n                        define conditional flag with value True\n  -x, --hex             use hex output\n  -s {6,7,8,9,10,11,12}, --symnamelength {6,7,8,9,10}\n                        maximum length of symbol names (default:6)\n\nSee https://github.com/bug400/capasm for details\n```\n\n*capasm* provides built-in global symbol tables for the HP-83/85, HP86/87 \nor HP-75 computers. The required symbol table is selected with the *-g* \noption. The naming of these tables is:\n\n- 85  : symbol table for the HP-83/85\n- 87  : symbol table for the HP-86/87\n- 75  : symbol table for the HP-75\n- none: use no symbol table (this is the default)\n\nAlternatively you can provide the file path of a global symbol table which must be created with the *capglo* utility (see below). The file must have\nthe extension \".py\".\n\nYou can enable additional checks with the *-c* option. The assembler issues\na warning if:\n\n* A symbol defined in the source file has an other value or type than a global\n  symbol of the same name\n* R# is used as data register operand in literal immediate mode and the value of\n  the drp is unknown, e.g.: `LABELA   ADM R#,1,2,3,4`\n\n\nNCAS Assembler command line parameters\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou get a description of the command line parameters if you type:\n\n        ncas -h\n\n```\nusage: ncas [-h] [-b BINFILE] [-l LISTFILE] [-g GLOBALSYMBOLFILE] [-r {0,1,2}]\n            [-p PAGESIZE] [-w WIDTH] [-c] [-o]\n            sourcefile\n\nAn assembler for the Hewlett Packard HP-75\n\npositional arguments:\n  sourcefile            source code file (required)\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -b BINFILE, --binfile BINFILE\n                        binary object code file (default: sourcefilename with\n                        suffix .bin\n  -l LISTFILE, --listfile LISTFILE\n                        list file (default: no list file)\n  -g GLOBALSYMBOLFILE, --globalsymbolfile GLOBALSYMBOLFILE\n                        global symbol file. Use either the built-in symbol table\n                        names {\"85\",\"87\",\"75\",\"none\"} or specify a file name for\n                        a custom table (default: 75)\n  -r {0,1,2}, --reference {0,1,2}\n                        symbol reference 0:none, 1:short, 2:full (default:1)\n  -p PAGESIZE, --pagesize PAGESIZE\n                        lines per page (default: 66)\n  -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH\n                        page width (default:80)\n  -c, --check           activate additional checks\n  -d DEFINE, --define DEFINE\n                        define conditional flag with value True\n  -o, --oct             use octal output\n\nSee https://github.com/bug400/capasm for details.\n\n```\n\n*ncas* uses the built-in HP-75 global symbol table per default. You may override\nthis with the *-g* option to use not any or another symbol table. Custom symbol\ntables must be created with the *capglo* command (see below). This file must\nhave the extension *.py*.\n\nRegarding the extended checks option see the chapter above.\n\n\nCreate LIF image files for Series 80 computers\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTo store the assembled LEX file *ftoc.bin* into an Upload LIF image file type:\n\n        caplif ftoc.bin\n\nThis creates a LIF image file *ftoc.dat* that has a LIF file system where\nthe file *ftoc.bin* is stored with the default file name *WS_FILE* and the\nfile type 0xE008 (BPGM Binary Program). This Upload LIF image has a nonstandard \nvolume header and is inteded for use with the\n[HP-85/85B787 Emulator](http://www.kaser.com/hp85.html) of Everett Kaser.\n\n*caplif* can not insert multiple input files into an upload LIF image file.\n\nYou can specify a different file name for the Upload LIF image file with the \n*-l* option:\n\n        caplif ftoc.bin -l disk0.dat\n\nYou can define another name for the LIF directory entry than WS_FILE as well:\n\n        caplif ftoc.bin -l disk0.dat -f ftoc\n\nThe file name specified with the *-f* parameter is converted to uppercase. \n\nFor the LIF directory entries the following rules apply:\n\n* The maximum length is 8 charaters\n* The file name must begin with a character\n* The remaining characters must be letters, digits or underscores - \n  underscores are allowed for the Series 80 only!\n\n\nCreate LIF images for the HP-75\n-------------------------------\n\nUpload LIF images for the HP-75 are created in almost the same manner as for the Series 80 computers. However, the command line parameter *-m 75* is required for *capasm* and *caplif*.\n\n*caplif* adds an HP-75 RAM file header to the assembled LEX file and stores it \nin the file system of the Upload LIF image with the file type 0xE089 (HP75 LEX file). The default file name in the directory entry is the name of the binary object file without suffix. This Upload LIF image file has\na standard volume header and can be used with the [EMU-75 Emulator](http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/emu71/index.html) of J-F Garnier.\n\n\nLIF image file creator command line parameters\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYou get a description of the command line parameters if you type:\n\n        caplif -h\n\n```\nusage: caplif [-h] [-m {75,85,87}] [-l LIFIMAGEFILENAME] [-f FILENAME] binfile\n\nUtility to put an assembled binary file into an import LIF image file\n\npositional arguments:\n  binfile               binary object code file (required)\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -m {75,85,87}, --machine {75,85,87}\n                        Machine type (default=85)\n  -l LIFIMAGEFILENAME, --lifimagefilename LIFIMAGEFILENAME\n                        name of the Upload LIF image file (default: objectfile\n                        name with suffix .dat)\n  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME\n                        name of the LIF directory entry (default: WS_FILE for\n                        Series 80, deduced from object file name for HP-75)\n\nSee https://github.com/bug400/capasm for details.\n```\n\n\nAdd LEX file headers to assembled LEX files\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe *caplex* utility adds a LEX file header to an assembled Series 80 LEX file.\nIf the *-m 75* parameter is specified, an HP-75 RAM file header and a\nLEX file header is put in front of the assembled lex file.\nThe program operates the same way as the *caplif* utility.\n\n\nCreate ROM image files\n----------------------\n\nThe *caprom* tool converts an assembled binary file to a ROM image. An appropriate ROM header must be present in the assembled binary file. The size of the ROM image file must be specified. *caprom* fills up the assembled binary file to the size of the ROM image and creates the appropriate checksum(s). This is supported for HP-83/85, HP-87 and HP-75 ROM image files. The ROM type is determined from the ROM header in the assembled binary file.\n\nUse *caprom -h* for a description of parameters.\n\n\nCreate custom global symbol tables\n----------------------------------\n\nA custom global symbol table is a text file which only has DAD or EQU definitions. The *capglo* utility converts this file into a global symbol table which can be fed to the assembler with the *-g* option.\n\nIf you have a custom global symbol source file *myglobal.glo* then:\n\n        capglo myglobal.glo\n\ncreates the global symbol table file *myglobal.py*. This file is a Python \nfile, therefore:\n\n* Do not change the suffix *.py* of that file\n* Do not edit the content of the file.\n\nTo use this global symbol table to assemble the file *sample.asm* type:\n\n        capasm sample.asm -g myglobal.glo\n\n\nConvert Series 80 Assembler files\n---------------------------------\n\nThe *capconv* utility can convert binary global symbol data files or \ntokenized Series 80 assembler source files to text files. See \n*capconv -h* for details how to invoke this tool. Note: Since the \n*capasm* software suite does not support the Series 80 character set, \nthe result files must be revised if any characters exist in the file \nwhich are not in the code range (0x20-0x7A, 0x7C).\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nThe global symbol file for the HP-75 contains a couple of duplicate entries \n(see the file *duplicateSymbols.txt* in the *symbols* directory).\nThe last entry is used in each case.\n\nThe *ncas* assembler is still in beta phase. Processing faulty assembler \nfiles has not been tested sufficiently.\n\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\nSee the [Release Notes](https://github.com/bug400/capasm/blob/master/RELEASE.md) for details.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCAPASM is published under the GNU General Public License v2.0 License \n(see LICENSE file).\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nA special acknowledgement goes to \n[Everett Kaser](https://www.kaser.com/hp85.html).\nHe formerly wrote the HP-83/85 Assembler ROM software which is a heroic deed\ncompared to writing an assembler in Python without any constraints concerning\nmemory or CPU speed.\n\nOn his website you can download his HP85/HP87 emulator and a powerful disassembler (CAPDIS) for the Capricorn CPU. His  documentation \n[Understanding how the HP85 Works from the Inside](https://groups.io/g/hpseries80/wiki/1884), the source files he disassembled from the ROM binaries \nand his warm support were essential for me to get this software done.\n",

    "license": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., <http://fsf.org/> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
