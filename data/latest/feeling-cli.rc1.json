    "description": "# Feeling\n\n![Feeling in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/feeling/main/img/feeling.png)\n\n## Introduction\n\nFeeling is designed to be a simple terminal-based feelings tracker,\nproviding a simple command line interface for recording a feeling at any\ntime, and an application (built with\n[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) for reviewing the recorded\nfeelings.\n\n## Installation\n\nFeeling can be installed using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):\n\n```sh\n$ pipx install feeling-cli\n```\n\n**NOTE:** The package name (`feeling-cli`) is slightly different from the\nactual application name because the package name wasn't available via PyPi.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeeling is one command that is split into two parts. There is a simple\ncommand line interface for recording a feeling, and a full-screen user\ninterface for looking back over what's been recorded and how it all fits\ntogether and flows.\n\n### Recording a feeling\n\nTo record a feeling, on the command line, just type:\n\n```sh\n$ feeling <rating> <description>\n```\n\nSo, for example:\n\n```sh\n$ feeling good I installed feeling and will use it to track how I feel\n```\n\nThis will make a record for the moment that the feeling is recorded. You can\ndo this as many times as you like. The more you record, the more you'll\nbuild up a record of your day, month, year...\n\nFeeling takes a simple approach of having five levels of feeling, and it\nwill also look for various words that map to those levels (I'll add to them\nover time). The levels and the words associated with them are:\n\n### -2\n\nVery low. Words associated with this level are:\n\n- Horrible\n- Lowest\n- Rubbish\n- Worst\n\n### -1\n\nLow. Words associated with this level are:\n\n- Blah\n- Down\n- Downbeat\n- Low\n- Meh\n- Negative\n\n### 0\n\nNeutral. Words associated with this level are:\n\n- Flat\n- Level\n- Neutral\n- Ok\n- Okay\n\n### 1\n\nGood. Words associated with this level are:\n\n- Better\n- Fine\n- Good\n- Positive\n- Upbeat\n\n### 2\n\nVery good. Words associated with this level are:\n\n- Amazing\n- Awesome\n- Elated\n- Excellent\n- Fantastic\n- Great\n- Wonderful\n\n### Viewing your feeling history\n\nTo view the history simply run `feeling` with no parameters. For now this is\njust a simple read-only interface; you can look through years, months and\ndays, and see the colour-coded overall record for each. In time I aim to add\nmore features (such as the ability to go back and edit, or remove entries).)\n\n## Data\n\nThe data for the application is held in the appropriate [XDG home data\ndirectory for your\nplatform](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).\nOn Unix-like systems expect to find it in `~/.local/share/feelings`.\n\n## TODO\n\nThis is a very early release, where I'm just testing out the basic idea. My\naim is that the data format is already stable (it is quite simple), but the\nuser interface of the main application may change significantly as I play\naround with it.\n\nThings I aim to do:\n\n- [ ] Expand the list of words for the feelings scale.\n- [ ] Generally improve the main application user interface.\n- [ ] Add the ability to edit items within the main application.\n- [ ] Add the ability to remove items within the main application.\n\n## Licence\n\nFeeling - A simple terminal-based feelings tracker  \nCopyright (C) 2023 Dave Pearson\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option)\nany later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
