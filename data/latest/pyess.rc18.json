It was written for lack of an official API. It should allow to\ndesign home automation around the current state of a solar energy system - e.g. turn appliances on when there is surplus\nsolar power. LG only offers access via a badly scriptable web page or alternatively via a proprietary app that - at least\non my phone - crashes at least twice for every successful startup.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nFor this python module I reverse-engineered the communication between the *LG EnerVu Plus 1.2.3* Android\nApp and the Energy Storage / Inverter device, so there is some likelihood that it will work for devices that\ncan be accessed via that app. Nevertheless it looks like some of the interface is delivered by the ESS as html via the\nnetwork. Therefore it may be that not all commands work against all boxes. I only have customer-level access to my own\nbox, so this module only offers those parts of the API that are accessible to me as a customer. As far as I can tell\nthe installer has higher privileges and can fiddle with internal parameters of the system from what I saw him do when he\ninstalled the system.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n- `Command Line`_\n\n * `Fetch the device password`_\n * `Find the esses on your network`_\n * `Fetch the state from ess as json`_\n * `Graphite wrapper`_\n\n- `MQTT Wrapper`_\n\n * `essmqtt as systemd service`_\n * `essmqtt config file`_\n * `MQTT discovery for homeassistant`_\n\n\n\nCommand Line\n------------\nThis module comes with a rudimentary command line interface that allows for the following actions.\n\nFetch the device password\n.........................\n\nCaveat: **To fetch the device password you need to be connected to the devices wifi.** Once you are on the wifi you can\nrun the following to get the password. Write it down, it seems it is a static password per device::\n\n    esscli --action get_password\n\nThe command assumes that the ess device is listening on ``192.168.23.1`` on its own wifi, in my setup it reproducibly\nchooses that IP.\n\nFind the esses on your network\n..............................\nGet a list of ESS devices on the local network (your home wifi, not the one of ess)::\n\n    esscli --action list_ess\n\n\nFetch the state from ess as json\n................................\nfetch a bunch of json states as json and display the result on the command line::\n\n    esscli --action get_data --password <your ess_password>\n\nExamples for the data available:\n- current power from and to the grid and the battery\n- current voltage and power from both strings of the photovoltaic system independently\n- current ip address\n- details on grid power, battery state, daily and monthly statistics\n\nGraphite wrapper\n................\n\nThe ``log_against_graphite`` command will fetch the ``home`` and ``common`` info from ess every 10 seconds and log them against a graphite\nserver (assuming standard port and udp as protocol). Running this command requires the ess password to be passed on\nthe command line::\n\n    esscli --action log_against_graphite --password <your_ess_password> --graphite <ip_of_graphite_server>\n\n\nMQTT wrapper\n------------\nSync ess state with an mqtt server (also accepts commands)\n..........................................................\n\nTo connect your ESS with an mqtt server run the following in your venv::\n\n    essmqtt --mqtt_server=<your_mqtt_server> --mqtt_user <your_mqtt_username> --mqtt_password <your_mqtt_password> --ess_password <your_ess_password>\n\nYour ESS will show up in ``ess/#`` on mqtt.\n\nAvailable values to control the ess (write true/false) **Remember that this is an MIT-Licensed software and I take no responsibility for the usage of this library. That being said I send the same commands the app would send to trigger these actions to my best knowledge.**::\n\n   ess/control/winter_mode\n   ess/control/fastcharge\n   ess/control/active\n\nAvailable paths with metrics to read from::\n\n    ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power 0\n    ess/home/statistics/batconv_power 190\n    ess/home/statistics/bat_use 1\n    ess/home/statistics/bat_status 2\n    ess/home/statistics/bat_user_soc 81.25\n    ess/home/statistics/load_power 191\n    ess/home/statistics/load_today 0.0\n    ess/home/statistics/grid_power 1\n    ess/home/statistics/current_day_self_consumption 0.0\n    ess/home/statistics/current_pv_generation_sum 0\n    ess/home/statistics/current_grid_feed_in_energy 0\n    ess/home/direction/is_direct_consuming_ 0\n    ess/home/direction/is_battery_charging_ 0\n    ess/home/direction/is_battery_discharging_ 1\n    ess/home/direction/is_grid_selling_ 0\n    ess/home/direction/is_grid_buying_ 1\n    ess/home/direction/is_charging_from_grid_ 0\n    ess/home/operation/status start\n    ess/home/operation/mode 1\n    ess/home/wintermode/winter_status on\n    ess/home/pcs_fault/pcs_status pcs_ok\n    ess/common/PV/brand LGE-SOLAR\n    ess/common/PV/capacity 5850\n    ess/common/PV/pv1_voltage 26.500000\n    ess/common/PV/pv2_voltage 26.700001\n    ess/common/PV/pv1_power 0\n    ess/common/PV/pv2_power 0\n    ess/common/PV/pv1_current 0.110000\n    ess/common/PV/pv2_current 0.000000\n    ess/common/PV/today_pv_generation_sum 0\n    ess/common/PV/today_month_pv_generation_sum 438389\n    ess/common/BATT/status 2\n    ess/common/BATT/soc 81.2\n    ess/common/BATT/dc_power 190\n    ess/common/BATT/winter_setting on\n    ess/common/BATT/winter_status on\n    ess/common/BATT/safty_soc 20\n    ess/common/BATT/today_batt_discharge_enery 135\n    ess/common/BATT/today_batt_charge_energy 0\n    ess/common/BATT/month_batt_charge_energy 72692\n    ess/common/BATT/month_batt_discharge_energy 51250\n    ess/common/GRID/active_power 2.790000\n    ess/common/GRID/a_phase 230.899994\n    ess/common/GRID/freq 49.959999\n    ess/common/GRID/today_grid_feed_in_energy 0\n    ess/common/GRID/today_grid_power_purchase_energy 0\n    ess/common/GRID/month_grid_feed_in_energy 266094\n    ess/common/GRID/month_grid_power_purchase_energy 7037\n    ess/common/LOAD/load_power 191\n    ess/common/LOAD/today_load_consumption_sum 135\n    ess/common/LOAD/today_pv_direct_consumption_enegy 0\n    ess/common/LOAD/today_batt_discharge_enery 135\n    ess/common/LOAD/today_grid_power_purchase_energy 0\n    ess/common/LOAD/month_load_consumption_sum 157890\n    ess/common/LOAD/month_pv_direct_consumption_energy 99603\n    ess/common/LOAD/month_batt_discharge_energy 51250\n    ess/common/LOAD/month_grid_power_purchase_energy 7037\n    ess/common/PCS/today_self_consumption 0.0\n    ess/common/PCS/month_co2_reduction_accum 311256\n    ess/common/PCS/today_pv_generation_sum 0\n    ess/common/PCS/month_pv_generation_sum 438389\n    ess/common/PCS/today_grid_feed_in_energy 0\n    ess/common/PCS/month_grid_feed_in_energy 266094\n    ess/common/PCS/pcs_stauts 3\n    ess/common/PCS/feed_in_limitation 70\n    ess/common/PCS/operation_mode 0\n\nI use ``mosquitto_sub`` to find the values I'm interested in while debugging like so::\n\n    mosquitto_sub -v -h <your_mqtt_server> -p 1883 -u <your_mqtt_user> -P <your_mqtt_password> -t \"#\"\n\n\nessmqtt as systemd service\n..........................\nTo set up ``essmqtt`` as a daemon (systemd service) it is recommended to install it in a venv first::\n\n  python3.7 -m venv <path_to_venv>\n  <path_to_venv>/bin/pip install pyess\n\nset up your `essmqtt config file`_ from then on ``essmqtt`` can be called via ``<path_to_venv>/bin/essmqtt``.\n\nA systemd service file ``/etc/systemd/system/essmqtt.service`` could look like so::\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=ESS MQTT wrapper\n\n    [Service]\n    # all essmqtt command line arguments can be used here. it is recommended to configure essmqtt in a config file\n    # for this use case\n    ExecStart=<path_to_venv>/bin/essmqtt\n    # Restart will keep the service alive for instance in case the mqtt server goes down or isn't up yet\n    # when esmqqt starts\n    Restart=on-failure\n    # a sensible restart delay prevents fast restart loops potentially denial-of-servicing the ess.\n    RestartSec=10\n\n    [Install]\n    # we'd like to start, but only after network is up\n    WantedBy=default.target\n    Wants=network-online.target\n\nIt can be started like any regular service via ``systemctl start essmqtt`` or enabled for boot up starts via\n``systemctl enable essmqtt``. Logs can be displayed using systemctl as well via ``systemctl status essmqtt`` or for\nmore lines ``systemctl status -n 100 essmqtt``\n\nessmqtt config file\n...................\n\nTo permanently configure essmqtt you can create a config file in either ``/etc/essmqtt.conf`` or ``~/essmqtt.conf``\nof the user running ``essmqtt`` or you can specify which config file to load by using the argument ``--config_file``.\nThe config file can contain any of the command line arguments. Example::\n\n   ess_password = <your_ess_password>\n   mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>\n   mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>\n   mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>\n   # optional settings\n   ## sensors for homeassistant MQTT discovery (default is not set -> homeassistant autoconfig disabled)\n   # hass_autoconfig_sensors = ess/common/BATT/soc,ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power,ess/common/GRID/active_power,ess/common/LOAD/load_power\n   ## update interval for MQTT values in seconds (default is 10 seconds)\n   # interval_seconds = 10\n   ## only send the values below common every n'th update of those for home\n   ## this is a debugging option that shouldn't be required, (default is 1)\n   # common_divisor = 1\n\n\n\nMQTT discovery for homeassistant\n................................\n``essmqtt`` can provide autoconfiguration for `homeassistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_.\n\n**prerequisites:** mqtt must be set up with `mqtt discovery <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/>`_ in homeassistant\n\nTo select the sensors that should be autodiscovered by homeassistant, provide the ``--hass_autoconfig_sensors``\nargument with a comma separated list of all mqtt pathes you want to see as sensors in homeassistant. Some autodetection\nof the value type is done so for instance if an mqtt path contains ``power`` it is assumed to be a power\nvalue in watts. Of course this can also be configured in a config file.\n\nExample config file::\n\n   ess_password = <your_ess_password>\n   mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>\n   mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>\n   mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>\n   hass_autoconfig_sensors = ess/common/BATT/soc,ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power,ess/common/GRID/active_power,ess/common/LOAD/load_power\n\n\n\nAPI\n---\nFor the time being please use the docstrings in the code on https://github.com/gluap/pyess as documentation for the\nAPI. A good place to start is pyess/cli.py where you can find the implementation of the CLI. One thing available\nvia the API but not yet via the CLI is the data for the daily / weekly / monthly / yearly statistics graphs that can\nbe accessed via the EnerVu App.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n**2022-03-15 0.1.14**\n - fix typo in mqtt autoconfig\n\n**2020-06-12 0.1.12**\n - Only publish homeassistant autoconfig information once\n\n**2020-06-01 0.1.11**\n - for cleaner restarts pass exceptions out and set up the full communication freshly when MQTT or ess crashes\n\n**2020-06-01 0.1.10**\n - add another possible fix for #7 after logging showed that an MQTT error might be the cause.\n\n**2020-06-01 0.1.9**\n - add homeassistant auto config\n\n**2020-05-30 0.1.8**\n - refactor uploading to MQTT to avoid accidentally trying to access a string by key (should fix #8)\n\n**2020-05-30 0.1.7**\n - add config file to allow storing settings for essmqtt\n\n**2020-05-30 0.1.6**\n - repair crash introduced with 0.1.5\n\n**2020-05-30 0.1.5**\n - some extra logging, timeouts and exception handling.
