The utility is not a daemon, meaning it will run once and then die. So to monitor that a certain process is running, you would for example have `procmon` in cron.\n\nIf the looked for process is running, `promon` will exit with return code `0`. If the process isn't found or if not enough processes are found (see `-e` flag), then `procmon` exits with `1`.\n\n# Usage\n\nCheck if a process is running:\n\n    procmon \"firefox -param\"\n\nMake the filter case-insensitive (`-i` / `--insensitive`):\n\n    procmon -i \"FiReFox -param\"\n\nMandate the minimum number of matched processes expected (default is 1):\n\n    procmon -e 5 \"firefox -param\"\n\nSetting the log level:\n\n    procmon --log-level debug \"firefox -param\"\n\nSending an email notification on error. This requires you to have a `procmon.cfg` configured with the SMTP server settings:\n\n    procmon --send-email \"firefox -param\"\n\n# Configuration\n\nThe configuration of `procmon` happens at two levels; \n\n1. In the CLI (command line interface)\n2. In a configuration file (this is where SMTP settings etc are)\n\n## CLI\n\nThe below is a copy of the `procmon --help` output. It shows available configuration parameters and their meaning.\n\n    usage: procmon [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-e EXPECTED_MATCHES] [-i] [--send-email] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] [--version] [filter]\n\n    positional arguments:\n      filter                Filter string to match processes for\n    \n    options:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG\n                            Path for configuration file (default: /etc/procmon.cfg, ./procmon.cfg)\n      -e EXPECTED_MATCHES, --expected-matches EXPECTED_MATCHES\n                            Number of matches required for a successful result\n      -i, --insensitive     Case insensitive process matching\n      --send-email          Send email notification\n      --log-level LOG_LEVEL\n                            Log level; debug, info, warning, error\n      --version             Print the procmon version number\n\n## Configuration file\n\nUsing a configuration file is _entirely optional_ for users that are not using the `--send-email` option. The configuration file is only used for configuring SMTP settings and similar.\n\n### Paths\n\n`procmon` is looking for configuration files in the following paths:\n\n- `/etc/procmon.cfg`\n- `./procmon.cfg`\n\n### Example configuration file\n\nA full example of a configuration file can be found under [https://github.com/sebdah/procmon/blob/main/examples/procmon.cfg](https://github.com/sebdah/procmon/blob/main/examples/procmon.cfg)\n\n### Example\n\nThe below command would be looking for a process called `python bpytop` (case insensitive). It would expect to find _at least_ 2 matches. And it would be logging on the debug level.\n\n    procmon -i --log-level debug -m 2 python bpytop\n\n# Development\n\n## Releasing\n\n1. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml` and `procmon`\n2. Commit the version number updates\n3. Create a new git tag `git tag <version>`\n4. Push version updates and tags `git push && git push --tags`\n\n## EditorConfig\n\nThe project uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for configuration of IDEs for development. Please make sure you have EditorConfig enabled in your IDE when developing, that will make your code abide to the coding guidelines automatically.\n\n## Running tests\n\nThe `Makefile` is configured for running tests unless you want to run it in your editor. Simply execute:\n\n    make test\n\nThis assumes that Python and `pytest` are available on your host.\n\n# License\nAPACHE LICENSE 2.0 Copyright 2022 Sebastian Dahlgren\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
