    "description": "=================\nPlatform Migrator\n=================\n\nPlatform Migrator is an application to migrate software from its current\nsystem to a different system. System here is defined by the package managers\nthat will be used to install any required packages.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo run Platform Migrator, you will need Python 2.7 or greater on the base\nsystem, i.e. the system which currently has the software, and Python 3.5 or\ngreater on the target system, i.e. the system to which the software has to be\nmigrated. Currently, only Linux based operating systems are supported. It may\nwork on other OSes but has not been tested.\n\nPlatform migrator should be installed on the target system only. It will copy\nthe necessary files over to the base system as required.\n\nPlatform Migrator can be installed from PyPI with ::\n\n    pip3 install --user platform-migrator\n\nor from this git repo with ::\n\n    git clone https://gitlab.com/mmc691/platform-migrator\n    cd platform-migrator\n    python3 setup.py install --user\n\nExecution\n---------\n\nThe application is executed in 4 steps:\n\n1. Configure the application as per the docs.\n2. Start the server on the target system with ``platform-migrator server start``.\n   See the docs for complete set of options available.\n3. On the base system, execute the following on the command line: ::\n\n   curl http://<server-name>:<server-port>/migrate > script.py\n   python script.py\n\n4. Back on the target system, run ``platform-migrator migrate <name> <config>``.\n   The docs have the full set of options for this as well.\n\nIf the migration was successful, the software will be saved in the configured\noutput directory.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation for the project is available at\nhttps://platform-migrator.readthedocs.io/ and also in the\n`docs/ <https://gitlab.com/mmc691/platform-migrator/tree/master/docs>`_\ndirectory of this repository.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis application was written with the support and guidance of\n`Prof. Dennis Shasha <https://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/shasha/>`_ and\n`Prof. Cristophe Pradal <https://team.inria.fr/virtualplants/christophe-pradal/>`_\nas part of a capstone project at New York University.\n",
