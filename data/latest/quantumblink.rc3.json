    "description": "# QuantumBlink\n\n\n\n# **INTRODUCTION**\n\nQunatumBlink is a python module developed by **Anoop A Nair**, under the supervison of **Vishnu E K,Ph.D [@ K.G.T. Labs]**.  It helps in the **analysis of flouresence intermittency data** obtained from the MT-300 single photon detector. The module when provided with the Intensity vs Time trace derives the **ON/OFF event PDFs** and the correlations in data indicating the **memory effect**. \n\n\n# **HOW TO INSTALL**\n\nThe `Quantum Blink` module depends on the `numpy` module for most of it's functionality.\n\nTo Install `numpy` use:\n\n\n```\npip install numpy\n```\n\nTo install `QuantumBlink` use: \n\n```\npip install QuantumBlink\n```\n\n\nTo install `QuantumBlink` of a particular version say 1.x use: \n\n```\npip install QuantumBlink==1.x\n```\n\n# **HOW TO USE**\n\nThe module can be imported after installation using:\n\n```\nimport QuantumBlink as qb\n```\nThe csv file should contain two columns the first one being the time and second one being the intesity values.\n\n\n# **KEYWORDS and METHODS**\n\n ## > **Data Acquisition**\n\n\n ### >> Intensity data\n\n```\nIntensityData  =  IntensityDataAcquire(PATH)\n```\n\n\n> 1.**INPUT**\n> * PATH = \"the path to the csv data file\"\n\n> 2.**OUTPUT**\n> *
