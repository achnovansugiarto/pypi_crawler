Before I decided to write my own project, I looked for\nprojects that would fit my needs. And while I found quite a few out there, they were\neither to simple or to complex for my needs. One project in particular that got\nalmost right for my needs is [gitlab-webhook-receiver][gitlab-webhook-receiver].\nHowever I had a few issues with it when I tested it, so I decided to write my\nown. I took inspiration on this project, specially the `config.yaml` file, so thank you\nfor the idea, I will be using a similar approach here.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install this package:\n\n```console\npip install yagwr\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter the installation, a script called ``yagwr`` will be available:\n\n```console\nyagwr rules_and_actions.yml\n```\n\nFor a complete list of all command line options, please execute:\n\n```console\nyagwr --help\n```\n\nA more detailed documentation can be found here: https://yagwr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\n\n[gitlab-webhook-receiver]: https://github.com/pstauffer/gitlab-webhook-receiver\n\n\n",
