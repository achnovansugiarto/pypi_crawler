    "description": "# <img src=\"./caroline/html/images/caroline2.png \" alt=\"Caroline logo\" width=\"200\" height=\"66\">\n\n**Caroline** is open-source Python framework for interactive web/HTML+JS based\nscience presentations.\nWith Caroline you can show and annotate everything.\nInterface is minimalistic and focus is on content, as we stick to the principle that\nthe best software is the one that you don't realize is there.\nCaroline blurs distinction between slides and whiteboard, between\ndemonstration and derivation, and smoothly even crosses from one way lecturing\nto interacting with the audience, allowing real-time note-taking, quizzes and even\nall-to-all collaboration.\nWith Caroline making flow of ideas smooth, we can now reimagine how lectures can\nlook! Caroline is made specifically not just to impress the audience\nbut to allow you to do everything you possibly can to reach \"aha!\" moment\nof understanding and inspiration, thanks to\n\n* **Simple input:** supports full markdown support, LaTeX, code highlighting, zoomable figures; shows blinking pointer when mouse/pen pressed...\n\n* **Annotations** textual or by drawing during lecture **over anything** (text, video, figure...)\n\n* **Camera support:** for lecturer view; multiple camera for experimental demonstrations\n\n* **Interactive elements:** interactive figures, 3D objects, movies, JavaScript simulations and other IFrames\n\n* **Audience engagement:** quizzes, Roundtable discussions and feedback, audience slide-copy supports annotations and exploration in parallel with a lecture\n\n* **Simple portability, and a decluttered interface focused on really necessary**: Works in any web browser (from PC to smart fridge), **even offline** (assuming that no online materials are added in IFrames). Presentation is defined with\na human readable plain text file that can be easily versioned with git.\n\n**Example presentation** that highlights Caroline's capabilities [is available here](https://nikolasibalic.github.io/caroline/example/presentation.html). The link opens lecturer copy. To see\naudience copy, follow the link on the first opened slide, but keep lecturer copy open to control presentation and see audience-submitted responses.\n\nExample of stand-alone **Roundtable** - surface for collaborative feedback -\n which is part of is available at [https://roundtable.researchx3d.com](https://roundtable.researchx3d.com) as a public demo server.\nRoundtable can be accessed from within the Caroline framework also.\nWhen used as support during meetings (in-person, video conference or mixed),\nit is ideally viewed opened on horizontal tablet surface while keeping\nvertical surface for direct view of collaborators, keeping the usual geometry of\nin-person meetings.\n\n [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/Caroline-presentation.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/Caroline-presentation)\n\n## Get started in 5 minutes\n\nStart by installing Caroline package from calling Python pip ([install Python first](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) if you don't have it)\nfrom the command line :\n\n```\npip install caroline-presentation\n```\n\nIn the folder where you want to make your presentation run\n```\npython -m caroline.template\n```\n\nThis creates a template presentation in the folder. Edit presentation by changing\n`presentation_code.py` in your favorite code editor. Save changes and run\n```\npython presentation_code.py\n```\nTo open/preview a presentation open `presentation.html` (or just refresh the page if it is already opened).\n\nAlternatively, if you want to start from one full example of presentation, run\n\n```\npython -m caroline.example\n```\n\nTo see other methods to start presentation that has support for\ninteraction with the audience, or that is automatically pre-filled\nwith material you have provided in a folder, please check\n[ways to start a new presentation](doc/start.md).\n\n## Name and logo\n\n**Caroline** is named after [Caroline Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel)\n(1750-1848) who was a pioneering astronomer and scientist. She had independent\nscientific career as a creator of New General Catalogue and discoverer of several\ncomets, in addition to her work with her brother\n[William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel) (1738 -1822)\nearly in her career. She was the first woman to receive a salary as a\nscientists, the first woman to hold a government position in England,\nthe first woman to publish scientific findings in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society.\n\nThe **arrow** and the **line** below Caroline name in the package's logo illustrate\nthe aim of the package to **show and annotate everything**.\n\n**Roundtable** is part of the Caroline framework, inspired by collaborative feedback\nsessions during supervision meetings. It is named after famous [Round table of\nKing Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table), where everyone\nis equal, since when using Roundtable everyone can contribute, manipulate\nand annotate the content equally.\n\n\n## Authors & contributing\n\nDeveloped by [Nikola Šibalić](https://github.com/nikolasibalic), with\nencouragement, constructive feedback and early testing by\n [Charles S. Adams](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/c-s-adams/).\n\nIf you like the Caroline, or Roundtable sub-project, please spread the word!\n\nIf you want to contribute to the project check [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Caroline is open-source, build with open-source stack of tools with aim to be flexible and adjustable.\n\n## License\n\nAll the files distributed with this program are provided subject to the\nBSD-3-Clause license.
