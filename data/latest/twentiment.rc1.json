    "description": "twentiment\n==========\n\nResearch project on twitter sentiment analysis using the Na√Øve Bayes\nClassificator.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall from PyPI (soon) or github with::\n\n    pip install -e git+https://github.com:passy/twentiment.git\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFirst, start the twentiment server that loads the data from a JSON file. A\nsample is available `in the repository <https://github.com/passy/twentiment/blob/623f4064469850b40b50db4707f12a07047f022b/samples/few_tweets.json>`_.\n\n::\n\n    twentiment_server samples/few_tweets.json\n\nAfter that, you can use ``twentiment_client`` to query the server using the\nsyntax ``GUESS my tweet to be scored``.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n::\n\n    twentiment> GUESS hello world\n    OK 0.0\n    twentiment> GUESS This car is amazing.\n    OK 0.5\n    twentiment> GUESS My best friend is great.\n    OK 0.9285714285714286\n    twentiment> GUESS Whatever.\n    OK 0.0\n    twentiment> GUESS This car is horrible.\n    OK -0.5\n    twentiment> GUESS I am not looking forward to my appointment tomorrow.\n    OK -0.9852941176470597\n\n\nWishlist\n--------\n\n(Ranked by importance)\n\n    * Have a web-frontend that searches for tweets and rates their sentiment.\n    * Give the server an option to fork the server process into the background\n      and launch a shell like twentiment_client right away.\n    * Restructure the Classifier to allow adaptive retraining, i.e. provide a\n      TRAIN command that adds new samples at runtime.\n        * At the moment, most of the calculations are done at start-up time, so\n          querying is rather cheap. Could be difficult to find a good balance.\n\n    * Persistence of the server state. Maybe through redis? Only important with\n      TRAIN functionality.\n    * Add some sort of parallelism to the server, so querying doesn't block.\n    * Add a way of importing live training data from twitter (like from\n      analysing emoticons)\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis is a project report for the Business Intelligence course. To increase the\nlearning potential, I tried to reuse as little as possible from the excellent\n`NLTK <http://nltk.org/>`_ project and reimplemented the relevant parts myself.",
