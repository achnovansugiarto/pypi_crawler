    "description": "# flecsimo\nSoftware components of the research/educational model of a cellular \nproduction site. This development is part of the flecsimo project (flexible \ncellular manufacturing simulation model), initiated at Frankfurt University \nof Applied Sciences and co-funded by DigLL 2020 (https://www.digll-hessen.de/).\n\n## Release notes 0.1.3\nThis release is a development release. It does not implement all desired \nfeatures and only promises to work, if the user does exactly the right things \nin the right way. With this, it should be considered as a \"proof of concept\", \nrather than a general usable software.\n\n**THEREFORE**: this version is not intended to be used in real learning \nenvironments!\n\n### Installation\nUse ``pypi install flecsimo`` to install a testable version and all \nrequired python dependencies. It is recommended to install in a virtualenv.\n\nAdditional to the pypi installation, you have to install, configure \nand run a mqtt server to fully operate flecsimo (e.g. Eclipse mosquitto, \nsee https://mosquitto.org).\n\n### Testing\nAfter installation (using a virtualenv) you will find the libraries in the \nsite-packages directory and the executable python scripts in your script \ndirectory. Running the scripts requires to set PYTHONPATH or to call the \nscripts as arguments of the python interpreter, e.g. \n``python Scripts\\site_control.py``\n\nThis version does *not* include the uni-test scripts (as they are not ready \nto use yet). Visit the documentation homepage \nhttps://confluence.frankfurt-university.de/display/FFP. Information how to run \na test scenario will be published there soon.\n\n### Closing Remarks:\nIf You are interested in the concept and want to support us in development, \ndesign of future use cases, or just providing feedback, please contact the \nmaintainers. \n\n## Why flecsimo?\nFor detailed information on visit \nhttps://confluence.frankfurt-university.de/display/FFP\n\n### Problem statement\nThe current developments in production logistics - generally discussed under \nthe terms of digitisation or Industry 4.0 - will have a considerable impact on \nthe working and living world of the future. Key elements of this change are \nso-called \"cyber-physical systems\", i.e. the integration of IT systems into \nphysical devices.\n\nThe technical complexity of these systems, however, makes access difficult for \nnon-technical, especially business management courses of study, although the \ntopic is of great relevance to these in particular. Pure software simulations \nof such systems are very complex to realize, didactically difficult to use and \ndemonstrate the cyber-physical character of digitization only very abstractly \nand thus often incomplete.\n\n### Planned solution\nThe project comprises the design and implementation of a hardware simulation \nmodel with four autonomous workstations (e.g \"drilling\", \"painting\", ...) as \ncyber-physical production systems.\n\nThe workstations are based on Fischertechnik training models and can be \npositioned anywhere in the four fields of a carrier module . \nThis results in the grid of a so-called \"flexible cell production\", as it is \nforced in practice for Industry 4.0 scenarios. An autonomous, self-propelled \ntransportation system handles the material flows between the stations. In \naddition, a high-bay warehouse or existing Fischertechnik Training Model can \nbe connected. The plant is equipped with cameras that allow the processes to be \ntransmitted to other locations.\n\nAlong with the technical solution, the project will offer the required learning \nmaterial.\n\n### Intended users\nThe flecsimo project is licensed under GPLv3+. We hope that users at \nUniversities and educational institutions benefit from our solution, but we \nwould also be happy to get support from an open user community to keep on \ndevelopment.\n\n## Roadmap\nThe system will be used first at Frankfurt University in winter term 2020/21. \nIt will comprise\n* the workstations communication backbone\n* the first physical models\n* the first version of learning material\n\nBased on the evaluation of winter term, we plan to implement the following \nfeatures on mid- to longterm base:\n* improve stability\n* improve management of the site (including improved GUIs and a simulation \ncockpit) \n* importer for ERP data (e.g. SAP IDocs)\n* collecting readings in time series databases (like kafka)\n* gradually implement automatic transportation between workstations and \nwarehouse (e. g. an AGV model).\n* implement logistics planning algorithms and data analysis  \n* ... and everything which we like to do :) \n\n",
