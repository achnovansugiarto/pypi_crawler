Otherwise if you really want to change it, you can do it at:\n\n```python\n<python path>/Lib/site-packages/mtms/initials/database/metro_db_struct.sql\n```\n\n<br />\n\n---\n\n# Description\n\n<br />\n\n## Hardware Requirements\n\n| **Hardware Requirements** |\n| --- |\n| PC or Laptop satisfying the below software requirements |\n\n<br />\n\n## Software Requirements\n\n| **Software Requirements**| |\n| --- | --- |\n| **OS** | Any; _Preferred: Windows 10_ |\n| **Python** | &gt;= 3.8 |\n| **pip** | &gt;= 20.1 |\n| **MySQL** | &gt;= 15.1 |\n| **Command Prompt** | Yes; _Preferred: Windows Terminal from Windows 10 Store - [download](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)_ |\n| **Font** | Any; _Preferred: Consolas or any other Hindi supporting font_ |\n\n<br />\n\n## Understanding the System\n\n<br />\n\nAim of this module is to bring easiness for everyone who works as a staff member at metro or a daily job person who uses metro as transport.\n\n**Metro Train Management System** helps one to manage different stations and their routes along with the counter system and customer booking system.\n\n<br />\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Line Routes are mentioned but there is no use of them because then it will become more tedious on our hand.\n- Customer cannot view his/her journey going on screen.\n- Customer has to remember a 36-character long token/card ID.\n\n<br />\n\n# Module Dependencies\n\n- OS\n- mysql.connection\n- uuid\n- time\n- datetime\n- sys\n- traceback\n- json\n- pickle\n- pyqrcode\n\n# User-defined Functions\n\n<br
