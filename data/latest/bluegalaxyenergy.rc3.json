    "description": "# Blue Galaxy Energy\n\n*Hologram: Shut up! You do not know the power of the Blue Galaxy Energy! Also known as the \"B.G.E\"*\n*Mr. Whereabout: The Loss, Part III, Volume I*\n\nBlueGalaxyEnergy is a tool to perform the so-called BGE attack described in\n\n- *Cryptanalysis of a White Box AES Implementation*, Olivier Billet, Henri Gilbert, Charaf Ech-Chatbi\n\nwith the optimizations proposed in:\n\n- *Improved cryptanalysis of an AES implementation*, Ludo Tolhuizen\n- *Revisiting the BGE Attack on a White-Box AES Implementation*, Yoni De Mulder, Peter Roelse, Bart Preneel\n\n## Compile\n\nTo compile and install the project, install gmp and ntl libraries and development headers (available in your OS package manager), e.g.\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt install libgmp-dev libntl-dev\n```\nor\n```bash\n$ sudo pacman -S gmp ntl\n```\n\nthen compile and install the package locally:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install bluegalaxyenergy\n```\n\n## Test\n\n```bash\n$ python3 -m bluegalaxyenergy --selftest\n```\n\n## Run the attack\n\n```python\nfrom bluegalaxyenergy import WhiteBoxedAES, BGE\n\nclass MyWhiteBoxedAES(WhiteBoxedAES):\n\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        # TODO\n\n    def getRoundNumber(self):\n        # return the number of rounds of the whitebox (10 for AES128,\n        #   12 for AES192 and 14 for AES256)\n        return 10\n\n    def applyRound(self, data, roundN):\n        # Apply a round of the whitebox on a buffer\n        # [param] data    a buffer of 16 bytes (type bytes)\n        # [param] roundN  the round number to apply (int in the range [0, self.getRoundNumber()) )\n        # return  16 bytes of the encrypted data by the round\n        return ... # TODO\n\nmywb = MyWhiteBoxedAES(...)\n\n# run the attack\nbge = BGE(mywb)\nbge.run()\n\n# extract the key from the available roundKey\nkey = bge.computeKey()\nif key is not None:\n    print(\"key:\", key.hex())\n```\n\nBy default, the method `run()` will extract all the rounds (except the last one who\ndoesn't have a mixColumns). You can limit which round to use for the attack\nwith the option `roundList` : `bge.run(roundList = [4,5,6,7,8])`. However, the\nattack needs three consecutive rounds in order to extract one round key.\nFor AES128, a minimum of three consecutive rounds is needed to extract the key.\nFor AES192 and AES256, the minimum is four consecutive rounds.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe implementation can be used on AES-whiteboxes which encrypt, not on those\nwhich decrypt.\n\nThe implementation does not cover the randomization in the order of the bytes\nof the intermediate results in AES, mentioned in De Mulder paper.\n\n## About\n\n### Authors and Contributors\n\nInitial Authors and Contributors:\n\n- Laurent Grémy\n- Nicolas Surbayrole\n- Philippe Teuwen\n\nFor next contributions, see the git projet history.\n\n### Copyright\n\n[Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com)\n\n### License\n\nBlueGalaxyEnergy is provided under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.txt).\n",
