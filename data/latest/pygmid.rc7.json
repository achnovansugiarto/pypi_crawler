The package also offers some scripts from the Paul Jesper's book.\r\n\r\nFor the gm/ID starter kit, written for MATLAB, please refer to the 'Links'\r\nsection at Prof. Murmann's website: https://web.stanford.edu/~murmann.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install pygmid from source, download from Github and run pip:\r\n\r\n`pip install .`\r\n\r\n in the root directory.\r\n\r\n pygmid can also be installed from PyPI:\r\n\r\n`pip install pygmid`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Scripting with the Lookup Class\r\nA gm/ID lookup object can be generated with the `Lookup` class. The lookup object requires lookup data for initialisation. Currently, only `.mat` files are supported.\r\n\r\nYou can create a lookup object as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pygmid import Lookup as lk\r\n\r\nNCH = lk('180nch.mat')\r\n```\r\n### Access MOS Data\r\nThe `Lookup` class allows for pseudo array access of the MOS matrix data. You can access data as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# get VGS data as array from NCH\r\nVGS_array = NCH['VGS']\r\n```\r\n\r\nData is returned as a deep copy of the array contained in the `Lookup` object.\r\n\r\n### Lookup functionality \r\n\r\nLookup of interpolated data occurs as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nVDSs = NCH['VDS'] \r\nVGSs = np.arange(0.4, 0.6, 0.05)\r\n# Plot ID versus VDS\r\nID = NCH.look_up('ID', vds=VDSs, vgs=VGSs)\r\n# alias function lookup can also be used\r\nID = NCH.lookup('ID', vds=VDSs, vgs=VGSs)\r\n# check bias\r\nVGS = NCH.look_upVGS(GM_ID = 10, VDS = 0.6, VSB = 0.1, L = 0.18)\r\nprint(f'VGS is: {VGS}')\r\n\r\nplt.plot(VDSs, np.transpose(ID))\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~Currently only lookup modes 1 and 2 are implemented.~~\r\nModes 1 (Simple parameter lookup), mode 2 (arbitrary ratio lookup) and mode 3 (cross lookup of ratios) are implemented. The companion lookupVGS function is also included.\r\n\r\n### Technology Extraction Functions\r\n\r\nThe EKV extraction function can be used as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pygmid import EKV_param_extraction, XTRACT\r\n\r\n(VDS, n, VT, JS, d1n, d1VT, d1logJS, d2n, d2VT, d2logJS)\\\r\n        = EKV_param_extraction(NCH, 1, L = 0.18, VDS = 0.6, VSB = 0.0)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample usage of this and other utility functions can be found in `test_utility.py` .\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nUsage of lookup scripts are given in `test_lookup.py` and `test_lookupVGS.py`.\r\n\r\nSample outputs are given below:\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/IDvVDS.png)\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/vtvsL.png)\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/gm_gds.png)\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/ft.png)\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/idwVDS.png)\r\n\r\n![image](docs/img/IDWvsgmID.png)\r\n\r\n### Command Line Interface (CLI)\r\n\r\n`pygmid` also features a CLI which can be used to run techweeps to generate transistor data\r\n\r\n## !TODO\r\n- ~~look_up MODE 3 (ratio vs ratio)~~\r\n- ~~look_upVGS and lookupVGS~~\r\n- ~~pchip interpolation~~\r\n- SPECTRE techsweep\r\n- Support for non .mat data structures\r\n- Improved logging for error generation\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n- Cian O'Donnell : cian.odonnell@tyndall.ie\r\n- Danylo Galach\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n- José Rui Custódio\r\n\r\nA special thanks to Prof. Boris Murmann for giving permission to use his work and release this package under the Apache 2.0 License.\r\n\r\n                                 Apache License\r\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\r\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\r\n\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n   1.
