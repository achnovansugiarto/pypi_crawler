    "description": "======\nircbot\n======\n\nbackground\n==========\n\nOn Feb 13th I joined the PyLadies folks (along with a friend, `@btanaka\n<https://twitter.com/btanaka>`_) to learn about how to make an IRC bot.\n\nThere was no formal presentation, but it was a great opportunity to get\ntogether with friends and hack. The notes from the event can be found `here\n<http://bit.ly/pyladychat>`_, with relevant code found at `this GitHub repo\n<https://github.com/trustrachel/pyladies-chatbot>`_.\n\nI can understand why `Rachel <http://trustrachel.com/>`_ would have started\nwith a repository that wouldn't have required a single sudo or pip command:\n`K.I.S.S <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_ . There is overhead\nassociated with teaching pip/virtualenv/etc. when people don't know what that\nis.\n\nAfter perusing the code in that repo, however, I thought that there had to be\na simpler way. Back in December the question of making an IRC bot came up in\nthe `BayPIGgies <http://www.baypiggies.net/>`_ mailing list, and Guido hisself\nanswered `with one word: Twisted\n<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/baypiggies/2012-December/008715.html>`_.\n\nI thought I ought to look at what it would take, and turns out that it isn't\nmuch; I made this repo/package so that people could grab the source, run\nsetup.py develop, and hack/execute to their heart's content. \n\nI hope someone finds it useful.\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nIf you're going to hack, clone this repo:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/smcquay/ircbot\n    cd ircbot\n    python setup.py develop\n\nAnd then continue to add code to ircbot.IRCBot.privmsg.\n\nIf you're not going to hack and just want a simple echo server:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install ircbot\n\n\nexecution\n=========\n\nOnce you've installed the bot, you can invoke it as such:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    ircbot -p 6668 -n echobot python utah-python\n\nor consult ircbot -h.",
