This package aims to make this easy regardless of sport needed to be plotted.\n\nThis repository contains code necessary to draw scale versions of playing surfaces to visualize play-by-play data for baseball, basketball, curling, football, hockey, soccer, and tennis in **Python**. For the **R** version of this package, click [here](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportyR).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install `sportypy` via `pip`, please run\n\n```bash\npip install sportypy\n```\n\n## Using the Package\n\nEach league that is supported by `sportypy` has its own class in its respective sport under the `surfaces` submodule. As an example, you can instantiate an NHL rink like so:\n\n```python\n# Load from the hockey submodule in surfaces\nfrom sportypy.surfaces.hockey import NHLRink\n\n# Create the NHL rink\nnhl = NHLRink()\n```\n\nIf you want to see what this would yield, you may call the `draw()` method that belongs to each league surface, like so:\n\n```python\n# Draw the NHL rink\nnhl.draw()\n```\n\n![Full NHL rink output from sportypy](img/nhl-rink.png)\n\nEach league's class may take on the following arguments:\n\n- `display_range`: This automatically \"zooms\" in on the area of the plot you're interested in. Valid ranges here vary by sport, but can be found in the docs\n\n- `x_trans` and `y_trans`: By default, the origin of the coordinate system *always* lies at the center of the plot. For example, `(0.0, 0.0)` on a basketball court lies along the division line and on the line that connects the center of each basket. If you want to shift the origin (and therefore the entire plot), use `x_trans` and `y_trans` to do so\n\n- `{surface_type}_updates`: A list of updates to the parameters that define the surface\n\n- `color_updates`: A list that contains updates to the features' colors on the plot. These are named by what the feature is, using `snake_case` to specify the names. To get the list of color names you can change, try running `cani_color_league_features()` from your desired league's class\n\n- `rotation`: An angle (in degrees) that you'd like to rotate the plot by, where +\\theta is counterclockwise\n\n- `xlims` and `ylims`: Any limits you'd like to put on the plot in the x and y direction. These will overwrite anything set by the `display_range` parameter\n\n- `{surface}_units`: If your data is in units that are different than how the rule book of the league specifies the units (e.g. you've got NHL data in inches, but the rule book describes the rink in feet), change this parameter to match the units you've got your data in. You're welcome to change the units of the data as well, but this is provided for convenience\n\n## TV View and Display Ranges\n\n### TV View\n\nAll of the `draw()` methods, by default, will draw the surface in what can be considered \"TV view\", or the way that the surface would typically be displayed on a television broadcast. This typically means the action moves from left to right across the screen (a basketball game that has the baskets on the left and right end of the court). As mentioned above, it is possible to change this to be in any orientation through the `rotation` parameter to each `draw()` method.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this:\n\n- `{baseball league}Field` plots are displayed from the high-home view by default, as baseball coordinates typically have the `+y` axis extending from the back tip of home plate towards center field\n\n- `{tennis league}Court` is displayed with the court diagrammed from the perspective of the chair umpire\n\n### Display Ranges\n\nRelated to the idea of custom displays of the plot is the concept of the `display_range` parameter in the league's class `draw()` method. This is unique to each sport, but globally supported across the package. This parameter allows the specification of a designated region of the surface to display. As an example, if you're trying to limit the analysis of NFL data to being inside of the red zone, you may want to do something similar to the following:\n\n```python\n# Import football fields\nfrom sportypy.surfaces.football import NFLField\n\n# Draw the red zone of an NFL field\nNFLField().draw(display_range = \"red zone\")\n```\n\n![Red zone rendered from NFL Field](img/nfl-red-zone.png)\n\nAnother use case would be to make the data you're viewing easier to see. Say you wanted to look at curling data, but only cared about stone positions in the house (and not the path as to how the stones got there). You might do this:\n\n```python\n# Import the curling sheets\nfrom sportypy.surfaces.curling import WCFSheet\n\n# Draw only the house of a curling sheet\nWCFSheet().draw(display_range = \"house\")\n```\n\n![Curling house rendered from World Curling Federation sheet](img/curling-house.png)\n\n## Surface Units\n\nEach league's surface has a standardized unit of measure in which the plot is created, and is standardized by the primary units specified in their respective rule books. They are as follows (and any explanation is in parentheses):\n\n|    Sport   |              League              | Primary Plotting Unit |\n|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n|  Baseball  |           Little League          |          `ft`         |\n|  Baseball  |               MiLB               |          `ft`         |\n|  Baseball  |                MLB               |          `ft`         |\n|  Baseball  |               NCAA               |          `ft`         |\n|  Baseball  |        NFHS (High School)        |          `ft`         |\n|  Baseball  |               Pony               |          `ft`         |\n| Basketball |               FIBA               |          `m`          |\n| Basketball |                NBA               |          `ft`         |\n| Basketball |           NBA G League           |          `ft`         |\n| Basketball |               NCAA               |          `ft`         |\n| Basketball |               NFHS               |          `ft`         |\n| Basketball |               WNBA               |          `ft`         |\n|   Curling  |  WCF (World Curling Federation)  |          `ft`         |\n|  Football  |                CFL               |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  |               NCAA               |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  | NFHS11 (High School, 11 players) |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  |  NFHS6 (High School, 6 players)  |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  |  NFHS8 (High School, 8 players)  |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  |  NFHS9 (High School, 9 players)  |          `yd`         |\n|  Football  |                NFL               |          `yd`         |\n|   Hockey   |                AHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |               ECHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |               IIHF               |          `m`          |\n|   Hockey   |               NCAA               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |                NHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |               NWHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |                OHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |                PHF               |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |               QMJHL              |          `ft`         |\n|   Hockey   |               USHL               |          `ft`         |\n|   Soccer   |                EPL               |          `m`          |\n|   Soccer   |               FIFA               |          `m`          |\n|   Soccer   |                MLS               |          `yd`         |\n|   Soccer   |               NCAA               |          `yd`         |\n|   Soccer   |               NWSL               |          `yd`         |\n|   Tennis   |                ATP               |          `ft`         |\n|   Tennis   |                ITA               |          `ft`         |\n|   Tennis   |                ITF               |          `ft`         |\n|   Tennis   |               NCAA               |          `ft`         |\n|   Tennis   |               USTA               |          `ft`         |\n|   Tennis   |                WTA               |          `ft`         |\n\nHowever, since the data that is supplied may come in various units of measure, the plots are able to be generated in the data's units. This is done via the `{surface_name}_updates` attribute in the class constructor, using the `{surface_name}_units` key. The features themselves will look visually identical, but the underlying coordinate grid will change.\n\n## Examples\n\nSome examples to help navigate the package:\n\n```python\n# Draw an NBA court\nfrom sportypy.surfaces.basketball import NBACourt\nNBACourt().draw()\n```\n\n```python\n# Customize a college basketball court to replicate that of the University of\n# Illinois Fighting Illini\nfrom sportypy.surfaces.basketball import NCAACourt\nNCAACourt(\n    colors_dict = {\n        \"offensive_half_court\": \"#e8e0d7\",\n        \"defensive_half_court\": \"#e8e0d7\",\n        \"court_apron\": \"#e84a27\",\n        \"two_point_range\": [\"#e8e0d7\", \"#ffffff66\"],\n        \"center_circle_fill\": \"#e8e0d7\",\n        \"painted_area\": [\"#e84a27\", None],\n        \"free_throw_circle_fill\": \"#e8e0d7\",\n        \"sideline\": \"#13294b\",\n        \"endline\": \"#13294b\",\n        \"division_line\": \"#13294b\",\n        \"center_circle_outline\": \"#13294b\",\n        \"lane_boundary\": [\"#ffffff\", \"#ffffff00\"],\n        \"three_point_line\": [\"#13294b\", \"#ffffff\"],\n        \"free_throw_circle_outline\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"lane_space_mark\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"restricted_arc\": \"#13294b\",\n        \"backboard\": \"#13294b\"\n    }\n).draw()\n```\n\n![sportypy-rendered Illini basketball court (sans logos/branding)](img/custom-ncaa-court.png)\n\n## Adding Analyses and Plotting Data\n\nIn addition to just creating the baseline plots, `sportypy` has several methods to display analyses on top of the surfaces that the classes create. The syntax is meant to wrap `matplotlib` methods.\n\nDue to the nature of the layering of the surface's features, it's recommended to use the `zorder` parameter in the range of `11` to `15` to display model outputs, and `zorder >= 20` to display individual tracking data points. This allows the features of the surface to be displayed when plotting models while also representing a birds-eye view of any action on the surface (e.g. player positions).\n\n```python\n# Plot shot locations provided by the Big Data Cup\n\n# Download the data\nbdc = pd.read_csv(\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdatacup/Big-Data-Cup-2021/\"\n    \"main/hackathon_nwhl.csv\"\n)\n\n# Select the Minnesota Whitecaps vs. Boston Pride game (first game in sample)\nbdc = bdc.loc[\n    (bdc[\"Home Team\"] == \"Minnesota Whitecaps\") &\n    (bdc[\"Away Team\"] == \"Boston Pride\")\n]\n\n# Filter to only be shots\nshots = bdc.loc[bdc[\"Event\"].isin([\"Shot\", \"Goal\"])]\n\n# Separate shots by team\nbos_shots = shots[shots[\"Team\"] == \"Boston Pride\"]\nmin_shots = shots[shots[\"Team\"] == \"Minnesota Whitecaps\"]\n\n# Instantiate a PHF rink, adjusting the coordinates to match the data\n# (The coordinate (0, 0) is in the bottom-left of the plot)\nphf = hockey.PHFRink(x_trans = 100.0, y_trans = 42.5)\n\n# Draw the rink on a matplotlib.Axes object\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nphf.draw(ax = ax)\n\n# Add the plot of each team's shots\nphf.scatter(\n    bos_shots[\"X Coordinate\"],\n    bos_shots[\"Y Coordinate\"],\n    color = \"#fec52e\"\n)\nphf.scatter(\n    200.0 - min_shots[\"X Coordinate\"],\n    85.0 - min_shots[\"Y Coordinate\"],\n    color = \"#2251b8\"\n)\n```\n\n![Boston Pride and Minnesota Whitecaps shots (data courtesy Big Data Cup 2021)](img/phf-shots-scatterplot.png)\n\nThe Whitecaps shots are on the left side.
