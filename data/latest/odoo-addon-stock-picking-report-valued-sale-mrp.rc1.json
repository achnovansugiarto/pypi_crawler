Now we'll be able to correctly summarize the picking\nvalue related to the selled kit with a relations of components and serials/lots\ndelivered.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo test this module:\n\n#. Configure some products with traceability and make them kit components.\n#. Sell the kits and go to the stock picking.\n#. Print the valued delivery slip:\n   - The total amount will now be correct.\n   - The kit components will be summarized in a single kit product line.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Matching selled kits and their delivered components it's quite tricky. There\n  are two possible approaches to findout from the component how many units\n  correspond with every whole kit:\n\n  - We could have a link to the original BoM line and guess it from it. This\n    approach is the one that Odoo has taken in v13 with the sale order line\n    deliveried quantities computation. The main issue is that if the original\n    BoM changes then we'd loose the correct units per kit reference.\n\n  - Another aproach (the one in this module) is to compute the component units\n    per kit matching the sale order line and its related moves demands. But if\n    the user manually adjust the demand on one model without adjusting it in\n    the order we'll have an incorrect reference as well.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-reporting/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-reporting/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_picking_report_valued_sale_mrp%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * David Vidal\n  * Carlos Roca\n  * Ernesto Tejeda\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-chienandalu| image:: https://github.com/chienandalu.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/chienandalu\n    :alt: chienandalu\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-chienandalu| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-reporting <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-reporting/tree/15.0/stock_picking_report_valued_sale_mrp>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
