    "description": "The Ember Factory\n=================\n\nObjective\n---------\nThe purpose of this software is to (re)produce burning ember diagrams of the style used in IPCC reports.\nAn example is figure 2 from the Summary for Policymakers of the \nSpecial Report on a global warming of 1.5Â°C: \n[SR15 Figure SPM.2](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SPM2-1003x1024.png). \nPlease note that this software is not a product of the IPCC; the IPCC is not responsible for projects or researches.\nThe ability of this software to reproduce several figures (previously) published by the IPCC was carefully tested.\n\nHow to use\n----------\nThis software (hereafter 'the EF') is designed to work as a web application. However, it is relatively easy to run it \"locally\":\n\n- The application is publicly available here: https://climrisk.org/emberfactory\n\n- To run it on your own computer, you need to have Python 3.x installed, then install the EF with pip: `pip3 install emberfactory`\n  Then set the environment variable needed by flask: `export FLASK_APP=emberweb` (for Windows: `$env:FLASK_APP = \"emberweb\"`) \n  and start with `flask run`. You should receive an url to open in your browser and access the EF, such as for example\n  http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n\n- To run the app on a server, you need to have a WSGI server such as Gunicorn (not included in the required packages\nbecause you do not need it to run the EF locally and you may have another WSGI server).  \nIf you want a root path such as /emberfactory, the EF is written so that you should set this path \nin the APPLICATION_ROOT variable within a file called emberfactory.cfg that needs to be\nlocated in your /instance folder (this is not entirely standard).\n\nStructure\n---------\nThe Ember Factory is made of two 'almost independent' packages:\n- embermaker contains the code (and default data) needed to draw burning embers. \nThe diagrams are obtained in PDF format.\n- emberweb is the user interface. \n\nThe reason why it is not yet 'fully independent' is that emberweb relies on auxiliary functions\nthat are in embermaker/helpers.py \n\nVersion numbers\n---------------\nThe main version number is increased with every change to any part of The Ember Factory,\n(emberweb and embermaker, see above). The main version number is in emberweb/__init__.py\nEmbermaker also has its own version number (in embermaker/__init__.py), so as to indicate changes\nthat might influence the 'product', ie. burning ember diagrams. However, our objective is to avoid any change\nthat would alter the reproduction of older figures, and tests are done before new releases to check that.\n\nDevelopment history\n-------------------\nThis software was created by philippe.marbaix -at- uclouvain.be at the end of 2019.\nThe first objective was to produce figure 3 of Zommers et al. 2020 ([doi.org/10/gg985p](https://doi.org/10/gg985p)).\nWhile I have a long experience of coding in a range of programming languages, this is\nmy first experience with a web application. I made efforts in order to have \na structure that can be understood and potentially extended in the future. Improvements were\nregularly provided during 2020 and this will likely continue if there are needs. \nSome aspects of the coding may still reflect the logic of the first versions rather than \nwhat would be done if starting from sratch; changes are done when they become useful, as experience\nalso drives further development. Any feedback is thus very helpful!\nThe work for this project is done outside of my duties for the \n[Plateforme wallonne pour le GIEC](https://plateforme-wallonne-giec.be).\n\nHelp is welcome to further improve the application. All contributions will be recognised :-).\n\nNo tracking by Google or anyone else\n------------------------------------\nI am making efforts to keep things 'fully under control', avoiding anything that could result in\nuser tracking: no fonts, icons or libraries downloaded from third-parties by the user.\nI would like this to continue in the future. Advice would be welcome.\nIt is also why the code is hosted by [framasoft](framasoft.org) using [gitlab](gitlab.org). I thank them both.  \n\n",
