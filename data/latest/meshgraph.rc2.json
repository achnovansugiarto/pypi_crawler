Meshgraph allows you to convert 3D objects\ninto graphs and thus perform algorithms on them.\n\n\n# How to use Meshgraph\n\n## Install\n\nInstall the _meshgraph_ package using:\n\n```python3  -m pip install meshgraph```\n\n## Convert .obj to Graph\n\nLoad a .obj file and convert it to a graph using:\n\n```python\nfrom meshgraph import ObjLoader\n\ngraph = ObjLoader.load_graph_from_file(path_to_obj_file)\n```\n\nor use a local string:\n\n```python\ngraph = ObjLoader.load_graph_from_string(obj_string)\n```\n\n## Nodes\n\nNodes can be accessed using:\n\n```python\nfrom meshgraph.Node import Node\n#...\ngraph_nodes = graph.nodes\n#Accessing by index:\nnode0 = graph.nodes[0]\n#Or using the accessor function:\nnode1 = graph.get_node(1)\n```\n\nAccess a node's position using:\n```python\nprint(node0.pos)\n```\n\nGet a distance between two nodes `node0` and `node1` using:\n```python\ndistance = node0.distance(node1)\n```\n\nAccess the neighbors of a node using:\n```python\nnode0.neighbors\n```\n\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright(c) 2022 Sebastiano Campisi - [ianovir.com](https://ianovir.com). \nRead the LICENSE file for more details.\n",
