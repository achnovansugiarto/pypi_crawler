```१,२३,४५,६७८.९०```\n* Abbreviations: ```Mr.``` &nbsp; ```e.g.``` &nbsp; ```w/o```\n* Lexicon entries with dashes: ```T-shirt``` &nbsp; ```father-in-law``` &nbsp; ```so-called``` &nbsp; ```Port-au-Prince```\n* Lexicon entries with apostrophe: ```Xi’an``` &nbsp;

Tokenized: ```( \"@ Hello , world ! @\" )``` &nbsp; Detokenized: ```(\"Hello, world!\")```\n\nIf later detokenization is not import and you want to suppress any markup with ```@```, call _utokenizer.py_ with the option _--simple_\n\nExample: ```(\"Hello,world!\")``` &nbsp; Tokenized (simple): ```( \" Hello , world ! \" )``` &nbsp; Detokenized: ```(\" Hello, world! \")```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Option --first_token_is_line_id</summary>\n\n### Option --first_token_is_line_id\nIn some applications, the text to be tokenized is preceded by a sentence ID at the beginning of each line and tokenization should *not* be applied to those sentence IDs.  \nOption ```--first_token_is_line_id```, or ```-f``` for short, suppresses tokenization of those sentence IDs.\n\n* Example input: ```GEN:1:1\tIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.```\n* ```utokenize.pl``` tokenization: ```GEN @:@ 1 @:@ 1 In the beginning , God created the heavens and the earth .```\n* ```utokenize.pl -f``` tokenization: ```GEN:1:1 In the beginning , God created the heavens and the earth .```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Why is tokenization hard?</summary>\n\n### Why is tokenization hard?\nTokenization is more then just splitting a sentence along spaces, as a lot of punctuation such as commas and periods are attached to adjacent words.\nBut we can't just blindly split off commas and periods, as this would break numbers such as `12,345.60`, abbreviations such as `Mr.` or URLs such as `www.usc.edu`.\n\n* There are many special types of entities that need to be preserved in tokenization, e.g. \n  * XML tags: ```<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodbowl.com\">```\n  * URLs: ```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8```\n  * Email addresses: ```а.almukhanov@energo.gov.kz```\n  * Filenames: ```Оперплан_каз2015.doc```\n  * Numbers: ```-12,345,678.90``` &nbsp; ```१,२३,४५,६७८.९०```\n  * Hashtags, handles: ```#global_warming``` &nbsp; ```#2``` &nbsp; ```@GermanBeer```\n* __Abbreviations__ can be hard to determine in many languages, as a period might indicate an abbreviation or the end of a sentence.\n  * Abbreviations: ```Mr.``` &nbsp; ```e.g.``` &nbsp; ```w/o```\n* __Apostrophes__ are normal letters in some languages, e.g. Somali ```su'aal``` (_question_). Apostrophes can appear in foreign names (e.g. ```Xi'an``` and ```'s-Gravenhage```). In some languages, an apostrophe is used for contractions, such as ```John's``` and ```we'll``` in English. Additionally, an apostrophe can be used as a quote around a word or phrase such as `'Good job!'`. All these cases have to be treated differently.\n* __Hyphens__ can join independent words such as in `peace-loving` (which should be split). But they also occur inside lexical phrases such as `T-shirt` that should __not__ be split.\n* Many applications need to map a tokenized sentence back to 'normal' untokenized text. To support such a __detokenizer__, the tokenizer's output must facilitate future detokenization. For example, by default, the tokenizer adds attachment tags such as '@' to punctuation to indicate to which side(s) they should attach after detokenization. For more on this topic, please see topic _Mark-up of certain punctuation_ above.\n* Other challenges: symbols, variation selectors, non-standard whitespaces, special characters such as `zero width non-joiner`.\n* In general, it is hard to make a tokenizer work __universally__, for a wide range of languages, scripts and conventions.\n* _utoken_ uses a combination of general patterns and lists of specific tokens to solve many of the challenges above. (See more under topic _Tokenization data files_.)\n* Example for a language-specific challenge: In Modern Hebrew, acronyms are marked by placing a _gershayim_ between the last two characters, e.g. ארה״ב (USA). In practice, the _gershayim_ is often replaced by the more readily available quotation mark (\"). However, quotation marks are also used for quotations, e.g. <span dir=\"rtl\">ה\"סתום\"</span> (the \"valve\"), so care has to be taken to do justice to both acronymns (preserve as a single token) and quotes (separate into multiple tokens).\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tokenization data files</summary>\n\n### Tokenization data files\n_utokenize_ includes a number of data files to supports its operation:\n* `tok-resource.txt` includes language-independent tokenization resource entries, especially for punctuation, abbreviations (e.g. ```km²```) and names (especially those with hyphens, spaces and other non-alpha characters)\n* `tok-resource-eng-global.txt` contains tokenization resource entries for English that are also loaded for other languages. This is helpful as foreign texts often code-switch to English.\n* `tok-resource-eng.txt` contains tokenization resource entries for English that are not shared, including those that would not work in other languages. For example, in English, _dont_ in a non-standard version of _don't_ and is tokenized into ```do``` ```n't```, but in French, _dont_ (_of which_) is a regular word that should be left alone.\n* `detok-resource.txt` includes resources for detokenization. The file is also used by the tokenizer to mark up certain punctuation with attachment tags such as @-@.\n* There are numerous other `tok-resource-xxx.txt` files for other languages, some larger than others. Some languages such as Farsi just don't use contractions and abbreviations with periods that much, so there are few entries. Others files might benefit from additional contributions. \n* `top-level-domain-codes.txt` contains a list of suffixes such as .com, .org, .uk, .tv to support tokenization of URLs and email address.\n\nExmaples of resource entries:\n```\n::punct-split ! ::side end ::group True ::comment multiple !!! remain grouped as a single token\n::contraction can't ::target can n't ::lcode eng\n::repair wo n't ::target will n't ::lcode eng ::problem previous tokenizer\n::abbrev No. ::exp number ::lcode eng ::sem-class corpus-component ::case-sensitive True ::right-context \\s*\\d\n::lexical T-shirt ::lcode eng ::plural +s\n::misspelling accomodate ::target accommodate ::lcode eng ::suffix-variations e/ed;es;ing;ion;ions\n\n::markup-attach - ::group True ::comment hyphen-minus ::example the hyphen in _peace-loving_ will be marked up as ```@-@```\n::auto-attach th ::side left ::left-context \\d ::lcode eng ::example 20th\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Speed</summary>\n\n### Speed\n210,000 characters per second (real time) on a 39k sentence English AMR corpus on a 2021 MacBook Pro using a single CPU.\nParallelization is trivial as sentences are tokenized independent of each other.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Testing</summary>\n\n### Testing\n_utoken_ has been tested on 71 corpora in 60 languages and 18 scripts (as of Oct. 18, 2021).\nTests include \n* Manual review of tokenization\n* Comparison to other tokenizers: [Sacremoses](https://github.com/alvations/sacremoses) and [ulf-tokenizer](https://github.com/isi-nlp/ulf-tokenizer)\n* Tokenization analysis scripts: \n  * wildebeest (text normalization and cleaning; analysis of types of characters used, encoding issues) \n  * aux/tok-analysis.py (looks for a number of potential problems such as tokens with mixed letters/digits, mixed letters/punctuation, potential abbreviations separated from period)\n* Comparisons to previous versions of all test corpora before release.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Related software</summary>\n\n### Related software\n* [Universal romanizer _uroman_](https://github.com/isi-nlp/uroman), written by Ulf Hermjakob (same author)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Future work — Feedback and contributions welcome</summary>\n\n### Future work — Feedback and contributions welcome\nPlans include \n* Building resources, testing and fine-tuning of additional languages such as Hausa and Serbian.\n* Adding new special entity types such as IPA pronunciations, geographic coordinates, complex IDs such as 403(k).\n* Semi-supervised learning of lexical and abbreviation resources from large corpora.\n</details>\n\n\n\n",
