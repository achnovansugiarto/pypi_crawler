    "description": "# Boto Endpoint URL shim\n\nConfigure `boto3` and `botocore` endpoint URL via environment variables or\nshared configuration file.\n\nThis project is motivated by the yet-to-be-merged [`boto3` PR#2746][1], and\nfollows the [`aws-sdk` proposal #230][2] (updated for commit [`b912470`][3]).\n\n## Quick start\n\nTo use the main interface described in [proposal #230][2], set up either\nservice-specific environment variables or `endpoint_url` in a service-specific\nsub-section of the shared configuration file and set up the proposed endpoint\nURL resolution.\n\n```py\nimport boto_endpoint_url_shim\nimport boto3\n\nboto_endpoint_url_shim.proposed_endpoint_url_resolution()\n\ns3 = boto3.resource(\"s3\")  # uses custom endpoint URL\n```\n\n## Endpoint URL resolution order\n\nThe core functionality of this package is exposed through the\n`proposed_endpoint_url_resolution` function which sets up the proposed endpoint\nresolution order of [proposal #230][2]:\n\n1. `endpoint_url` keyword argument\n    ```py\n    import boto3\n    boto3.resource(\"s3\", endpoint_url=\"http://localhost:8088\")\n    ```\n1. configuration via service-specific environment variable\n1. configuration via global environment variable\n1. configuration via service sub-sections of the shared configuration file\n1. configuration via global parameter in shared configuration file\n1. fallback to default endpoint determination of `botocore`\n\nThe first truthy value provided by one of the steps will be used as endpoint URL\nfor the clients and resources, otherwise the resolution continues to the next\nstep.\n\nAny other endpoint URL resolution order, can be set up using the\n`custom_endpoint_url_resolution` function, with passing the configuration\nfunctions as variadic arguments in the order they should be used.\n\n```py\nboto_endpoint_url_shim.custom_endpoint_url_resolution(step1, step2, ..., stepN)\n```\n\n## Endpoint URL configuration options\n\n### Proposed interface\n\nThe [proposal #230][2] includes four main methods for endpoint resolution, two\nservice-specific endpoint configuration and two global.\n\nThis main interface can be set up using `proposed_endpoint_url_resolution()`.\n\n#### Configuration via service-specific environment variable\n\nImplementation: `read_service_env_var`.\n\nRead the configuration from environment variables\n`AWS_<SERVICE_ID>_ENDPOINT_URL` in which `<SERVICE_ID>` is the `ServiceId` of\nthe of a specific service as defined in its `ServiceModel`, transformed with\nspaces replaced with underscores and letters upper-cased.\n\n```sh\nAWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB=http://localhost:8024\nAWS_ENDPOINT_URL_ELASTIC_BEANSTALK=http://localhost:8053\n```\n\n#### Configuration via global environment variable\n\nImplementation: `read_global_env_var`.\n\nRead the configuration from the global environment variable `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`\nand use this endpoint URL for all services.\n\n```sh\nAWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8099\n```\n\n#### Configuration via service sub-sections of the shared configuration file\n\nImplementation: `read_service_config_file`.\n\nRead the configuration from the shared configuration file, as the `endpoint_url`\nparameter under the `service_id` sub-section in the `services` definition. As\nabove, `service_id` is a transform for the `ServiceId` with spaces replaced with\nunderscores and letters lower-cased. The `services` definition to use is\nreferenced by key in the profile via the `services` parameter.\n\n```ini\n[services local-db-eb]\ndynamodb =\n    endpoint_url = http://localhost:8024\nelastic_beanstalk =\n    endpoint_url = http://localhost:8053\n[profile testing]\nservices = local-db-eb\n```\n\n#### Configuration via global parameter in shared configuration file\n\nImplementation: `read_global_config_file`.\n\nRead the configuration from the `endpoint_url` parameter at the top level of a\n`services` definition and use this endpoint URL for all services. The `services`\ndefinition to use is referenced by key in the profile via the `services`\nparameter.\n\n```ini\n[services local-services]\nendpoint_url = http://localhost:8099\n[profile testing]\nservices = local-services\n```\n\n### Alternative interfaces\n\nSeveral more interfaces are included in the [proposal #230][1], they have been\nimplemented as functions in this package.\n\nAs a convenience, the proposed interface above followed by the global\nenvironment variable and global configuration file methods can be set up using\n`global_endpoint_url_resolution`.\n\n#### Configuration via mapping in global environment variable\n\nImplementation: `read_mapping_env_var`.\n\nRead the configuration from the global environment variable `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`,\ncontaining a mapping of lower-case `service_id`s to endpoint URLs.\n\n```sh\nAWS_ENDPOINT_URL=\"dynamodb=http://localhost:8024,elastic_beanstalk=http://localhost:8053\"\n```\n\n**NB.** The mapping is loaded once on the first use of the function and cached\nfor later uses.\n\n#### Configuration via named top level parameters in shared configuration file\n\nImplementation: `read_named_top_level_config_file`.\n\nRead the configuration from the `<service_id>_endpoint_url` parameter at the top\nlevel of a profile, with `<service_id>` the lower-case `service_id`.\n\n```ini\n[profile local-services]\ndynamodb_endpoint_url = http://localhost:8024\nelastic_beanstalk_endpoint_url = http://localhost:8053\n```\n\n### Custom interface\n\nUsers are free to define and use functions to obtain the endpoint URL of a\nservice.\n\nThe custom functions must adhere to the following signature:\n\n```py\ndef func(session: botocore.session.Session, service_id: str) -> str | None: ...\n```\n\nwith:\n* `session` a `botocore.session.Session`\n* `service_id` the `ServiceId` of a specific service as defined in its\n  `ServiceModel`, transformed with spaces replaced with underscores and letters\n  lower-cased\n* `returns` a `str | None` either the endpoint URL or None to continue to the\n  next step in the resolution chain\n\n[1]: https://github.com/boto/boto3/pull/2746\n[2]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk/pull/230\n[3]: https://github.com/kdaily/aws-sdk/commit/b912470b21f3026252777f1db1c9a2bbdda57ab9\n",
