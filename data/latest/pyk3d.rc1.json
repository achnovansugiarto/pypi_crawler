It was chosen for the `Remote - Containers` extension that guarantees the same development environment for every developer. The project is configured so that everything works out of the box.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### File system organization\n\n- `src`: the source code of the application, and nothing more.\n- `tools`: anything else that's required to make the project work but is not a part of the application. This may include source code, shell scripts, configuration files, etc.\n- `tools/tooling` is used to explicitely link the various configuration files to the software that requires it.\n- `tests`: holds tests that can be run with `pytest`.\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\n#### Formatting\n\n- python: [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black).\n\n#### Linting\n\n- python: [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).\n- shell scripts: [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).\n\n#### Testing\n\n- python: [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/), with [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) to handle coverage and [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/ohmu/pytest-xdist) to handle parallelization.\n\n#### Type checking\n\n- python: [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)\n\n### CI/CD\n\nWhenever pull request is opened against the fork or a new changeset is pushed on the fork (including when a pull request is merged), the CI/CD will run. This is controlled by `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. The content of the file is kept to a minimum, to keep it both readable and clean.\n\nThe CI/CD is split into two jobs. `CI` ensures that the tests pass with supported python versions, except the one used for releasing. `CI-CD` ensures that the tests pass with the version of python used for releasing, and uploads the corresponding package without any action from the user. This guarantees that all uploaded packages have been tested with the expected python version.\n\nThe version and the upload destination of the package depend on the action that triggered the CI/CD as well as the branch on which this action was triggered. All branches will upload to `test.pypi.org`, but `release/X.Y` branches will also upload to `pypi.org`.\n\n### Versioning\n\nVersioning for major and minor numbers is handled by creating `release/X.Y` branches. The patch number is automatically generated based on existing releases. See `tools/releasing/version.py` for more details.\n\n### Makefile\n\nThe project uses a `Makefile` as a way to provide quick access to common commands. It should not be used to write complex scripts. It was chosen over `poetry` scripts because `make` is shorter to type than `poetry run`. Despite the shortfalls of `make` it is everywhere and many developers are used to `make target` commands. Finally the `Makefile` syntax should be awful enough that one would want to write a `shell` or `python` script and call it from the `Makefile` if something complicated needed to be done.\n",
