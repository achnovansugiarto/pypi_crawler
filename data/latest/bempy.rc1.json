    "description": "# bempy - Python Block-Element-Modifier Library\n`bempy` is a library for building complex classes using BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology.\n\nWith `bempy`, you can build reusable blocks of code that can be easily inherited, modified, and extended to create new and complex classes. The library uses a hierarchical structure to define blocks, elements, and modifiers, making it simple to understand and maintain large projects.\n\n## Features\n* Simple and easy-to-use syntax for defining blocks, elements, and modifiers\n* Support for inheritance, allowing blocks to inherit and extend the properties of other blocks\n* Ability to define default arguments and properties for blocks, making it easier to create instances of blocks\n* Support for automatic documentation extraction, allowing you to easily keep track of the purpose and usage of blocks and their components\n* A flexible structure\n\n## Concept\n`bempy` is a library for building complex classes based on the BEM methodology.\n\n### BEM\nBEM, or Block Element Modifier, is a methodology that helps developers build scalable, maintainable and reusable components for their projects.\n\nThe main idea behind BEM is to encapsulate appearance, logic and content of a component into distinct blocks that can be easily re-used and modified without affecting the rest of the application. Each block is treated as an independent entity and can be combined with other blocks to create complex structures.\n\nIn BEM, a block is the main building block of the application, and it can consist of multiple elements and modifiers. An element is a part of a block that cannot be used independently, and it provides additional functionality and styling to the block. A modifier is a variation of a block or element that changes its appearance or behavior.\n\nUsing BEM helps to create well-structured, modular and maintainable code that can be easily adapted to changing requirements. It also makes it easier for developers to collaborate on a project, as each block can be worked on independently and the resulting code is easy to understand and integrate into the rest of the application.\n\n### BEM Python\nThe blocks are stored in a specific directory structure:\n```\nblocks/\n    game/\n        Character/\n            _gender/\n                male.py\n                female.py\n                non-binary.py\n            _race/\n                human.py\n                elf.py\n                orc.py\n            _class/\n                warrior.py\n                mage.py\n                rogue.py\n            __init__.py\n\n     data_science/\n        Model/\n            _algorithm/\n                logistic_regression.py\n                decision_tree.py\n            _hyperparameters/\n                default.py\n                optimized.py\n            _preprocessing/\n                standard_scaler.py\n                normalizer.py\n            __init__.py\n\n      scientific_computing/\n         Solver/\n            _method/\n                finite_difference.py\n                monte_carlo.py\n                particle_swarm.py\n            _precision/\n                low.py\n                high.py\n            __init__.py\n```\n\nWith these modificators, you can create any combination of characters that represent the type of person you want in the game. In the example, the `Character` block is stored in the `game` directory, and it has several modificators such as `_gender`, `_race`, and `_abilities`.\n\nTo use the `Character` block in your game, you can create an instance of the block with specific modificator values. For example:\n```python\nfrom bem.game import Character\n\nFemaleElf = Character(\n    gender='female',\n    race='elf',\n    abilities=['agility', 'intelligence']\n)\n\ngamer = FemaleElf(\n    level=3,\n    fertility=75,\n    mana=50\n)\n```\n\nHere, we are creating a female elf character by passing the values for the `gender`, `race`, and `abilities` modificators to the `Character` block.\n\nAdditionally, we can define the level, health, and mana for this specific character instance by passing those values to `gamer = FemaleElf(...)`.\n\nWith this, we have successfully created a unique instance of a female elf character with specific abilities and attributes that can be used in your game.\n\nThe `Character` class is defined in `Character/__init__.py`:\n```python\nfrom bempy import Block\n\nclass Base(Block):\n    \"\"\"\n        A basic Character implementation\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def init(self, level=1):\n        \"\"\"\n            level -- The level of character\n        \"\"\"\n\n        print(self.name + ': Character created with level =', level)\n```\n\nThe Female `Modificator` class is defined in `Character/_gender/female.py`:\n```python\nclass Modificator:\n    \"\"\"\n        A Female gender implementation\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def init(self, fertility=100):\n        \"\"\"\n            fertility -- is the capability to produce offspring through reproduction\n        \"\"\"\n\n        print(self.name + ': Female created with fertility =', fertility)\n```\n\nThe Elf `Modificator` class is defined in `Character/_race/elf.py`:\n```python\nclass Modificator:\n    \"\"\"\n        A Elf race implementation\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def init(self, mana=0):\n        \"\"\"\n            mana -- The amount of mana\n        \"\"\"\n\n        print(self.name + ': Elf created with mana =', mana)\n```\n\n\n```python\n>>> from bempy.game import Character\n>>> FemaleElf = Character(gender='female', race='elf')\n>>> gamer = FemaleElf(level=10, fertility=75, mana=50)\ngame.Character: Character created with level = 10\ngame.Character: Female created with fertility = 75\ngame.Character: Elf created with mana = 50\n\n\n>>> Female = Character(gender='female', race='human')\n>>> ma = Female(level=86, fertility=100)\ngame.Character: Character created with level = 86\ngame.Character: Female created with fertility = 100\n```\n\nYou could create instances of machine learning models using different algorithms, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing techniques. For example:\n```python\nfrom bempy.data_science import Model\n\ndt_model = Model(\n    algorithm='decision_tree',\n    hyperparameters='optimized',\n    preprocessing='normalizer'\n)\n```\n\nYou could create instances of different types of solvers for scientific computing problems. For example:\n```python\nfrom bem.scientific_computing import Solver\n\nfd_solver = Solver(\n    method='finite_difference',\n    precision='high'\n)\n```\n\nHere is an example of how you could create instances of a backend using different components and configurations:\n```\nblocks/\n    backend/\n        Server/\n            _backend/\n                flask.py\n                django.py\n            _config/\n                debug.py\n                production.py\n            _extensions/\n                cors.py\n                db.py\n            __init__.py\n        Database/\n            _backend/\n                mongodb.py\n                mysql.py\n            _config/\n                local.py\n                remote.py\n            __init__.py\n```\n\nUsing the backend directory structure, you could create instances of the backend with specific configurations and components. For example:\n```python\nfrom bempy.backend import Server\n\nFlaskApp = Server(\n    backend='flask',\n    config='debug',\n    extensions=['cors', 'db']\n)\n\nFlaskApp(\n    host='localhost',\n    port=8080,\n    capacity=1000\n)\n```\nIn this example, `FlaskApp = Server(backend='flask', ...)` is the construction of a server block with the specified modificator. And `FlaskApp(...)` is creating an instance of the defined optimized server block.\n\n\n## Installation\nYou can install `bempy` library via `pip` by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\npip install bempy\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can import the library in your Python code by using:\n```\nimport bempy\n```\n\nYou can also install the latest version of the library directly from the source code by cloning the repository and running the following command:\n`python setup.py install`\n\n\n## Use Cases\n`bempy` has a wide range of use cases, beyond the original intended purpose of helping developers build complex UI components. Here are a few examples of how BEMPy can be applied:\n* **Data Science**: To data science projects to help structure and organize code. By breaking down data processing into blocks, it becomes easier to create and maintain complex data pipelines.\n* **Scientific Computing**: To structure complex mathematical models in a way that makes them more understandable, manageable and maintainable.\n* **Game Development**: The BEM methodology provides a way to structure game objects in a way that makes them easier to manage and maintain.\n* **API Development**: To build APIs that are easy to consume and understand. By breaking down a complex system into blocks and applying modularization techniques, it becomes easier to test, debug and maintain the API.\n* **Front-end Development**: To write clean, scalable and maintainable HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web front-end development. BEM methodology helps to encapsulate styles and behavior into blocks, making it easy to build and reuse UI components.\n* **Back-end Development**: By using BEM methodology to structure and organize code, it becomes easier to create and maintain complex systems.\n\nIn each of these cases, **bempy**'s structure and methodology helps developers to create complex systems that are maintainable and scalable over time. Whether you are working on a small project or a large enterprise application, `bempy` can help you write clean, modular and maintainable code.\n\n## Contributing\nI'm appreciate and welcome contributions to `bempy`.
