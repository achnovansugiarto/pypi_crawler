    "description": "# Hakilo - For splitting a text into sentences, and sentences into words.\n\nHakilo (meaning 'axe' in Esperanto) chops a text into sentences for analysis.\n\nSentences usually end with a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark,\nbut not every period indicates the end of a sentence. For example:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. C. Bisset is 1.6 meters tall.\n\nThe above sentence has four periods, but only the last ends the sentence.\n\nIf there is an end quote mark or an end bracket after a period, the sentence will include the end mark. For example:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactical officer said, \"Shields are down to 30 percent.\"\n\nThe last character of the above sentence is a quote mark.\n\nWhen the program encounters a blank line, or any vertical space, it treats this as the end of a sentence.\n\nLines with a length of 0, and lines without any alphabetic characters, are excluded from output. Thus the line:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\- 2.7\n\nwill not be included in the output.\n\n## Requirements\n\nHakilo was developed and tested on Python 3.7 .\n\n## Links\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/Indrikoterio/hakilo-python](https://github.com/Indrikoterio/hakilo-python)\n\nPyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/hakilo/1.1.1/](https://pypi.org/project/hakilo/1.1.1/)\n\n## Installation\n\nTry this:\n\n```\n$ python3 -m pip install hakilo\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Importing\n\n```\nimport hakilo\n```\n\n### read_file\n\nThis utility function reads in the entire file as a UTF-8 string.\n\n```\nthe_text = hakilo.read_file(\"frankenstein.txt\")\n```\n\n### split_text\n\nThis function splits the text and returns a list of sentences.\n\n```\nsentences = hakilo.split_text(the_text)\n```\n\n### split_sentence\n\nThis function splits the sentence into words and punctuation.\n\n```\nwords = hakilo.split_sentence(\"You can do better.\")\n```\n\n## Developer\n\nHakilo was developed by Cleve (Klivo) Lendon.\n\n## Contact\n\nTo contact the developer, send email to indriko@yahoo.com . Preferred languages\nare English and Esperanto.
