The goal of this project is to provide a stock screening\nsystem for various types of stock classifications (growth, momentum, value, etc.).\n\nSimilar to how one might rank the best options when they are deciding\nwhere to go to dinner, Stock Score lets investors choose what screens\nthey want to run. Then, this script takes care of the rest,\nshowing which stocks performed best under the given screens.\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- You can get the latest version of Python 3 here_ (this should come with the latest version of pip)\n- All dependencies are contained in `requirements.txt` (more on that directly below)\n\nGetting Started\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo clone this repository, run the following:\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/jackmoody11/stockscore\n\n\nChange working directory to project folder\n::\n\n    cd my/path/to/stockscore\n\nCreate a virtual environment\n::\n\n    python3 -m venv env\n\n\nActivate the virtual environment. See the docs_ for help.\n\nThen :code:`make init` to install required modules.\n\nRun the program!\n----------------\nTo make sure that everything is working, while in the working directory of the stockScore project, run :code:`python3 stockscore.py`.\n\n*Note*: Make sure you are using :code:`python3`.\nThis project does not support versions below Python 3.6 since it uses f strings.\nThis may change in the future to allow for earlier versions of Python to run.\n\nHere is an example output of what you can expect to see when you run the program:\n\nTerminal output:\n\n.. image:: /media/terminal_output.png\n\n\nTop 10 stocks output:\n\n.. image:: /media/StockScores.png\n\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nAll tests can be run by simply running\n::\n\n    pytest\n\nIn order to run a specific test file (like test_fundamental_functions.py), run\n::\n\n    pytest tests/test_fundamental_functions.py\n\n\nTo run a specific test (like \"test_dividend_test_returns_scores\" in test_fundamental_screens.py), run\n::\n\n    pytest tests/test_fundamental_screens.py -k 'test_dividend_test_returns_scores'\n\n\nFor more information on how to use pytest (like how to select a few tests),\n`look here`_ for the official pytest docs.\n\nDeployment\n----------\n\nIn order to make code styling simple, this project uses black_. To make sure that this code adheres to this opinion based formatting, stockscore uses :code:`pre-commit`. In order to run black automatically before making a commit, please download :code:`pre-commit`.\n\nYou may need to run :code:`pre-commit install` before you are able to use this. For more details, check out the `pre-commit`_ website.\n\nThis project is very simple to deploy to a live system. To change which tests you are using, change which functions are added to the suites (this is the name used in both files) of :code:`fundamental_functions.py` and :code:`technical_functions.py`.\n\nBuilt With\n----------\n\nPython 3 and some great third party modules (see `requirements.txt`_ for full list).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read the `code of conduct`_ for details on how to positively contribute to this project.\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nThis project uses `SemVer`_ for versioning. For the versions available, see the\n`tags on this repository`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE`_\nfile for details\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\n-  Hat tip to Benjamin Graham's *Intelligent Investor*. If you haven't already, read this book!\n-  Also, I recommend reading *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* by Philip Fisher.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n- *Note that the screens included in this project are not exclusive and do not guarantee any sort of returns. I assume no liability for investment decisions you make and am not a professional adviser. Please do your due diligence before making investment decisions and consult with a professional as necessary.*\n\n\n\n.. _here: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/\n.. _docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\n.. _look here: https://pytestguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _Dropwizard: http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/\n.. _Maven: https://maven.apache.org/\n.. _ROME: https://rometools.github.io/rome/\n.. _black: https://github.com/ambv/black\n.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com\n.. _`requirements.txt`: https://github.com/jackmoody11/stockScores/blob/master/requirements.txt\n.. _`code of conduct`: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n.. _SemVer: http://semver.org/\n.. _tags on this repository: https://github.com/jackmoody11/stockScores/tags\n.. _LICENSE: https://github.com/jackmoody11/stockScores/blob/master/LICENSE",
