    "description": "This is an implementation of a ``CSS Variables`` extension for Zope Browser \nResources.\n\nCascading Stylesheets don't have any built in method to define variables and use\nthem within the stylesheet. This feature was discussed at some CSS related\nblogs already and resulted in a `non-official draft specification`_.\n\n.. _`non-official draft specification`: http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/cssvariables/\n\nIn former Zope versions DTML templating language was used to define variables in \nCSS. This breaks CSS syntax, looks crappy and produces error messages in \nCSS-enabled editors even if the browser gets the correct values.\n\ncornerstone.cssvar uses an almost CSS syntax compatible variant to apply \nvariables::\n\n    div.foo {\n        color: var(myColor);\n    }\n\nIf we declare such a css resource using zcml it looks this way::\n\n    <browser:cssvarResource\n      name=\"foo\"\n      file=\"foo.css\"\n    /> \n\nIf we use the common mechanism to declare variables using css like syntax we\nmust do this in a separate file, this looks like::\n\n    @variables {\n        myColor: #123456;\n    }\n  \nThe variable itself need to be defined by a named ``ICSSVariables`` adapter on \nrequest. We can register it by an own zcml directive:: \n\n  <browser:cssvarDefinition\n    name=\"foodef\"\n    file=\"foodef.css\"\n  /> \n\nNow we just need to tell our first css file which definition to use. Here \ntheres no common syntax, so we put it in an comment::   \n\n    /# vardef(foodef) /#\n    div.foo {\n        color: var(myColor);\n    }\n  \nIf we now in browser look at ``http://mydomain.tld/++resource++foo`` it results\nin::\n\n    /# vardef(foodef) /#\n    div.foo {\n        color: #123456;\n    }\n     \nFor resource directories as defined by ``zope.app.publisher`` the special CSS \nhandling is registered for every CSS file if this module is imported.\n\nThis package is tested with Zope 3.5dev KGS (Python 2.6 )and in Zope 2.10.7 \n(with Plone 3.3 and Python 2.4).\n\n=====\nTODO:\n=====\n\n* Write tests!\n* Make resourceDirectory work in Plone.\n* Profiling and performance testing.  \n\n=========\nCopyright\n=========\n\nwritten by Jens W.
