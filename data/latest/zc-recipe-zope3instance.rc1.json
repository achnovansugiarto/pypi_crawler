    "description": "Recipe for createing a Zope 3 instance\n======================================\n\nThis recipe creates a Zope instance that has been extended by a\ncollection of eggs.\n\nThe recipe takes the following options:\n\nzope3 \n   The name of a section providing a Zope 3 installation definition.\n   This defaults to zope3.  The section is required to have a \n   location option giving the location of the installation.  This\n   could be a section used to install a part, like a Zope 3 checkout,\n   or simply a section with a location option pointing to an existing\n   install. \n\ndatabase\n   The name of a section defining a zconfig option that has a zodb\n   section.\n\nuser\n   The user name and password for manager user\n\neggs\n   One or more requirements for distributions to be included.\n\nzcml\n\n   If specified, provides the list of package ZCML files to include in\n   the instance's package includes and their order.\n\n   By default, the ZCML files normally included in package-includes\n   are ommitted.  To includes these, include '*' in the list of\n   includes.\n\n   Each entry is a package name with an optional include type and file\n   name.  An package name can be optionally followed by a ':' and a\n   file name within the package.  The default file name is\n   configure.zcml.  The string '-meta' can be included between the\n   file name and the package name. If so, then the default file name\n   is meta.zcml and the include will be treated as a meta include.\n   Similarly for '-overrides'. For example, the include::\n\n      foo.bar\n\n   Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-configure.zcml to be inserted\n   into package-includes containing:\n\n      <include package=\"foo.bar\" file=\"configure.zcml\" />\n\n   where NNN is a 3-digit number computed from the order if the entry\n   in the zcml option.\n\n   The include:\n\n      foo.bar-meta\n\n   Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-meta.zcml to be inserted\n   into package-includes containing:\n\n      <include package=\"foo.bar\" file=\"meta.zcml\" />\n\n   The include:\n\n      foo.bar-overrides:x.zcml\n\n   Causes the file named NNN-foo.bar-overrides.zcml to be inserted\n   into package-includes containing:\n\n      <include package=\"foo.bar\" file=\"x.zcml\" />\n\n      \nTo do\n-----\n\n- Need tests\n\n- Hopefully, for Zope 3.4, we'll be able to make the instance-creation\n  process more modular, which will allow a cleaner implementation for\n  this recipe.\n\n- Support for multiple storages\n\n- Support for more configuration options.",
