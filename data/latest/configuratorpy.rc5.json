You can separate the code logic with the variables that doomed to be changed (test environment, UAT environment, live environment and so on).\n\nThe database connection string will be different, the resource path will be different, and maybe even the process flow can be different if you have a strong configuration requirement.\n\nAs we all know, configuration is code too. For most of the time, you should version control your configuration files too.\n\nBut how can you track and deploy the scripts by [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (so all source codes are the same in all places with same version, for local, test, UAT and live), and have different configurations for each script?\n\nEnvironment variables come to help.\n\nThere is a [good article](https://www.doppler.com/blog/environment-variables-in-python) for this purpose, you should check it out. And you will know how to manage the configurations by using environment variables.\n\nBut, this is the only beginning.\n\n## Why use [TOML](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0)\n\n[TOML](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) is a good syntax for configuration, it nearly have the same functionality as [YAML](https://yaml.org/), but has less annoyments:\n\n* It use an [INI Syntax](https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/cck/docs/wizardmachine/syntax) to do the configuration, which is designed to be configuration file, much better than JSON, and easier to read than [YAML](https://yaml.org/)\n* It don't use indent level as data structure, believe me, this will save lots and lots of time for you, take the flowing example by TOML and YAML, and you'll understand what I'm saying:\n\n```YAML\nabcdef:\n bcdef:\n  cdef:\n   def:\n    ef:\n     f: 1\n```\n\n```TOML\n[abcdef.bcdef.cdef.def.ef]\nf=1\n\n```\n\nThe data structure of the two code are the same. But for YAML, since it use a indent structure to store the dict, when the level is deep, it will be quite a mess.\n\nBesides, since TOML as a very compact language specification, it's loader is much smaller and efficient, as for YAML, you even need to [choose the Loader that fits for you](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation), in fact, if you choose the wrong loader (say the full functional loader as FullLoader, it will be about 10 times slower than the C implementation of the Loader), even you use the one that implemented in C, YAML's load performance can be a little faster than the TOML one.\n\nThat's why you should use TOML than YAML.\n\n## Why use Macros\n\nTOML do have some drawbacks than YAML, first, it don't have any variable definition and reference in it. This will be quite annoying. Besides, you can't do the simple operations such as:\n\n* Iteration: This is quite useful when you have complex configurations\n* Increment, Decrement: This is quite useful for generating sequence names in your configuration file\n* Variables: This is very crucial for configuration files\n* Include: This is useful for you to separate configuration files into modules or based on categories, and will break down the big configuration file into small ones easier for management\n* Functions, Filters: This is quite useful for you to reuse the logic, say, create UUID for each item in the list\n\nWait, can't you see, this is just the requirements for the Macro Engine.\n\nYes, that's why I use a template engine like [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for this task.",
