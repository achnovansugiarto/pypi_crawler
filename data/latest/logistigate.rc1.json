    "description": "# logistigate\npython implementation of logistigate\n\nOverview of logistigate\n----------------\nGenerally speaking, the logistigate methods infer aberration likelihoods at\nentities within a two-echelon supply chain, only using testing data from sample\npoints taken from entities of the lower echelon. It is assumed that products\noriginate within the system at one entity of the upper echelon, and are\nprocured by one entity of the lower echelon. The likelihood of a lower-echelon\nentity obtaining product from each of the upper-echelon entities is stored in\nwhat is deemed the \"transition matrix\" for that system. Testing of products at\nthe lower echelon yields aberrational (recorded as \"1\") or acceptable (\"0\")\nresults. We then distinguish possible information-availability settings into\ntwo categories, Tracked and Untracked:\n - In the Tracked case, both the upper-echelon and lower-echelon entities\n     traversed by the tested product are known upon testing.\n - In the Untracked case, only the lower-echelon entity is entirely known, in\n     addition to the system's transition matrix.\nIt is further assumed that products are aberrational at their origin in the\nupper echelon with some entity-specific fixed probability, and that products\nacceptable at the upper echelon become aberrational at the destination in the\nlower echelon with some other entity-specific fixed probabiltiy. It is these\nfixed probabilities that the logistigate methods attempt to infer.\n\nMore specifically, the logistigate methods were developed with the intent of\ninferring sources of substandard or falsified products within a pharmaceutical\nsupply chain. Entities of the upper echelon are referred to as importers, and\nentities of the lower echelon are referred to as outlets. This terminology is\nused interchangeably throughout the logistigate package.\n\n",
