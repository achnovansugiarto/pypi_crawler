    "description": "=========================================\nDFBGN: Derivative-Free Block Gauss-Newton\n=========================================\n\n.. image::  https://travis-ci.org/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn\n   :alt: Build Status\n\n.. image::  https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg\n   :target: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0\n   :alt: GNU GPL v3 License\n\nDFBGN is a Python package for  nonlinear least-squares minimization, where derivatives are not available.\nIt is particularly useful when evaluations of the objective are expensive and/or noisy, and the number of variables to be optimized is large.\n\nDFBGN is based on `DFO-LS <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfols>`_, but is better-suited when there are many variables to be optimized (so the linear algebra in DFO-LS is too slow).\nUnlike DFO-LS, DFBGN does not currently support bound constraints on the variables.\n\nIf you are interested in solving general optimization problems (without a least-squares structure), you may wish to try `Py-BOBYQA <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/pybobyqa>`_.\n\nRequirements\n------------\nDFBGN requires the following software to be installed:\n\n* Python 2.7 or Python 3 (http://www.python.org/)\n\nAdditionally, the following python packages should be installed (these will be installed automatically if using *pip*, see `Installation using pip`_):\n\n* NumPy 1.11 or higher (http://www.numpy.org/)\n* SciPy 0.18 or higher (http://www.scipy.org/)\n* Pandas 0.17 or higher (http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n\nInstallation using pip\n----------------------\nFor easy installation, use `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ as root:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ [sudo] pip install dfbgn\n\nor alternatively *easy_install*:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ [sudo] easy_install dfbgn\n\nIf you do not have root privileges or you want to install DFBGN for your private use, you can use:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install --user dfbgn\n\nwhich will install DFBGN in your home directory.\n\nNote that if an older install of DFBGN is present on your system you can use:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ [sudo] pip install --upgrade dfbgn\n\nto upgrade DFBGN to the latest version.\n\nManual installation\n-------------------\nAlternatively, you can download the source code from `Github <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn>`_ and unpack as follows:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn\n    $ cd dfbgn\n\nDFBGN is written in pure Python and requires no compilation. It can be installed using:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ [sudo] pip install .\n\nIf you do not have root privileges or you want to install DFBGN for your private use, you can use:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install --user .\n\ninstead.\n\nTo upgrade DFBGN to the latest version, navigate to the top-level directory (i.e. the one containing :code:`setup.py`) and rerun the installation using :code:`pip`, as above:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ git pull\n    $ [sudo] pip install .  # with admin privileges\n\nTesting\n-------\nIf you installed DFBGN manually, you can test your installation by running:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n\nAlternatively, the HTML documentation provides some simple examples of how to run DFBGN.\n\nExamples\n--------\nExamples of how to run DFBGN are given in the `documentation <https://numericalalgorithmsgroup.github.io/dfbgn/>`_, and the `examples <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfbgn/tree/master/examples>`_ directory in Github.\n\nUninstallation\n--------------\nIf DFBGN was installed using *pip* you can uninstall as follows:\n\n .. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ [sudo] pip uninstall dfbgn\n\nIf DFBGN was installed manually you have to remove the installed files by hand (located in your python site-packages directory).\n\nBugs\n----\nPlease report any bugs using GitHub's issue tracker.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis algorithm is released under the GNU GPL license.
