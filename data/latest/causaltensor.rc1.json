    "description": "# CausalTensor\n CausalTensor is a python package for doing causal inference and policy evaluation using panel data. \n\n\n## What is CausalTensor\nCausalTensor is a suite of tools for addressing questions like \"What is the impact of strategy X to outcome Y\" given time-series data colleting from multiple units. Answering such questions has wide range of applications from econometrics, operations research, business analytics, polictical science, to healthcare. Please visit our [complete documentation](https://causaltensor.readthedocs.io/) for more information. \n\n## Installing CausalTensor\nCausalTensor is compatible with Python 3 or later and also depends on numpy. The simplest way to install CausalTensor and its dependencies is from PyPI with pip, Python's preferred package installer.\n\n    $ pip install causaltensor\n\nNote that CausalTensor is an active project and routinely publishes new releases. In order to upgrade CausalTensor to the latest version, use pip as follows.\n\n    $ pip install -U causaltensor\n    \n## Using CausalTensor\nWe have implemented the following estimators including the traditional method Difference-in-Difference and recent proposed methods such as Synthetic Difference-in-Difference, Matrix Completion with Nuclear Norm Minimization, and De-biased Convex Panel Regression.  \n\n| Estimator      | Reference |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| [Difference-in-Difference (DID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences) | [Implemented through two-way fixed effects regression.](http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/FEmatch-twoway.pdf)       |\n| [De-biased Convex Panel Regression (DC-PR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02780) | Vivek Farias, Andrew Li, and Tianyi Peng. \"Learning treatment effects in panels with general intervention patterns.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 14001-14013. |\n| [Synthetic Difference-in-Difference (SDID)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09970.pdf)   | Dmitry Arkhangelsky, Susan Athey, David A.
