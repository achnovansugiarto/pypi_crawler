    "description": "# Technical Analaysis Scanner\n\n## Goals\n\nThis software attempts to provide a framework that does a combination of\n(1) scanning and, (2) backtesting to ask and answer such questions as,\n\n- which instruments have responded well to the 4 hr MACD(26, 9, 12) in the\nlast quarter?\n\n- which stocks are getting close to their 20/50 Moving Average Crossover, and\nof those stocks, which have responded more than +/- 2.5% in the past?\n\n- which instruments in the last 2 weeks after trended out of their opening\nranges? What is the 1 and 2 std dev band for each isntrument at 30 minute\nintervals?\n\n### Digging a little deeper\n\nTechnical analysis sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. The goal of this\ncodebase is to provide means/methods for measuring a universe of instruments\nand determine which ones are behaving in line with various TA patterns\n\nIt's intended to work differently than a traditional backtester (eg, a\nQuantopian and QuantConnect). From what I undestand about backtesting, the\ngoal is to provide predetermined entry and exit rules, and measure the\nresults for a single or multiple instruments. This software is didferent\nit that it intends to experiment with the entry and exit rules and see how\nthose adjustments impact results.\n\n## Structure\n\nCore Framework lives in this repo, and your secret sauce parameter/configs,\nresearch findings live in another one.\n\nThis repo will feel like a mono repo to many, and focuses on\n\n- downloading market data (currently using IB API Gateway)\n- exposing market data\n- running multi-variate simulations\n- reporting results\n\n\n## Releasing\n\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\ntwine upload dist/*",
