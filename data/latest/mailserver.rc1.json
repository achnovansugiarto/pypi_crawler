    "description": "Develop Mailservices in Django\n==============================\n\nDjango Mailserver is an application that lets you develop\nmail services in your Django projects/applications in a manner\nthat handles messages as Django handles HTTP requests.\n\nThat project was initialy conceived as an improvement over\n`django-smtpd`_ by Denis Laprise, then became an almost full rewrite\nand when I thought I had gone through almost every line of code it\nseemed far much more like a fork than improvement.\n\nNOTE: that this is really alpha software, don't use it in a production\nenvironment unless you expect it to break everything ;)\n\n.. _django-smtpd:: http://code.google.com/p/django-smtpd/\n\nExample usage:\n==============\n\nFirst of all, you need to add \"mailserver\" in your INSTALLED_APPS, and\nyou'll want the settings::\n\n    ROOT_MAILCONF = 'myproject.mailbox' # Just like ROOT_URLCONF, but for\n                                        # resolving recipients.\n    MAILER_DAEMON_ADDRESS = 'postmaster@mydomain.com'\n\n``ROOT_MAILCONF`` is just like an URLCONF, but it matches e-mail addresses\ninstead of paths. An example ``myproject.mailbox`` ``mailbox.py`` file\nwould be::\n\n    from django_mailserver.mailbox import *\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n      (r'@bugs.example.com', include('myapp.mailbox')),\n    )\n\nNote, that when matching recipients, just as Django strips path elements\nas they get matches, ``mailserver`` strips already matched parts from\nthe addresses until it reaches the views.\n\nNow you can start you mail service! You can either to::\n\n    ./manage.py startmailapp <app_name>\n\nFrom your project directory to have a new app created with a sample mailbox.py\nfile in it, or you can create a new mailbox.py file in your existing application::\n\n    from django_mailserver.mailbox import *\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n      (r'^onedest', 'myapp.mailers.reply'),\n    )\n\nYou have it, your ``mailers.py`` file would be just like a ``views.py``::\n\n    from mailserver import EmailResponse\n\n    def reply(request):\n        print \"Got email %s, Reply!\" % request\n        return EmailResponse(\n                from_email=request.get_recipient_display(),\n                to=request['From'],\n                body=request.get_body(),\n                subject=\"Re: %s\" % request['Subject'])\n        \nYou get the idea, if you return an EmailResponse it gets ``send()``\nlater by the Handler. You can also return EmailIgnoreResponse among others.\n\nDelivering mails\n****************\n\nRight now the only possible way to deliver messages to this is through a\npipe transport to the ``./manage.py readmail`` command. Which is mostly\nintended for testing.\n\nFurther improvements should have a more performant pipe transport and a\nself-running SMTP server.\n\nTODO\n****\n\n**WARNING:** Django Mailserver is still under development. It is believed to\nbrake at any point ;) There are lots of things to do, like:\n\n    * Documentation\n    * More tests.\n    * Better URL parsing (i.e: includes work on domains, others on addreses).\n    * Handling address prefixes/suffixes\n    * Handling of error responses (ie: pipe transport should bring the\n      response status_code to the exit value of the process).",
