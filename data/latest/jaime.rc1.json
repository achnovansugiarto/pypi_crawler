    "description": "Jaime\n=====\n\nNOTE: THIS IS AT THE MOMENT (FEB 2014) ALPHA SOFTWARE AND IT'S STILL FAR FROM\nBEING ABLE TO DO WHAT'S DESCRIBED BELOW. SOON, THOUGH.\n\nJaime is a programmer's “code butler”. It is designed to help you get up to\nspeed on a new project, whatever that means. For instance, let's say you want\nto start a new WordPress-based Website:\n\n$ jaime wp new --domain example.com --codename sputnik --webserver nginx \\\n               --db mariadb --codehost bitbucket --branching simple\n\nAssuming Jaime has your API keys and/or logins for all the services involved,\nthe above command would register example.com on Namecheap, create a new code\nproject with the codename “sputnik”, generate nginx config files, setup\nWordPress on a git repository using the “simple” branching strategy, create a\nprivate project on BitBucket, and setup your git remotes. Let's say now you\nwant to start working on your project, no problem:\n\n# Setup MariaDB user and database for WordPress, configure nginx for the\n# project, and point example.com to localhost via the /etc/hosts file.\n$ jaime wp setup dev\n\n# Install a couple WP plugins\n$ jaime wp plugin install NAME1 NAME2\n\n# Make sure WP is up to date and upgrade it if it's not\n$ jaime wp upgrade --version latest\n\n# Let's setup Varnish…\n$ jaime wp varnish\n\n# And let's activate the Varnish config\n$ jaime wp setup dev\n\n# Work on WP on the browser…\n\n# All done. Let's deploy to a new server using our local DB.\n$ jaime wp deploy --host digitalocean --db copy",
