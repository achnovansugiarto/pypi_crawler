If access to GPU optimized tensorflow\nis not available, it’s sometimes possible to find precompiled binaries\non Github.\n\nI have compiled some optimized `tensorflow\nbinaries <https://github.com/jjangsangy/MacOS-TensorflowBuilds>`__ for\n``MacOS`` that people can use running the latest tensorflow and\nutilizing Intel Math Kernel Library.\n\nCorpus Sizes\n============\n\nMake sure your corpus has >100k characters at least, but for the best\n>1M characters. Relatively, that is around the size, of Harry Potter\nBook 7.\n\nArchitecture\n============\n\nWe implement a Stateful Stacked LSTM in Keras that can be customized on\nthe command line.\n\n::\n\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #\n    =================================================================\n    lstm_1 (LSTM)                (None, 40, 128)           110080\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    lstm_2 (LSTM)                (None, 40, 128)           131584\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    lstm_3 (LSTM)                (None, 128)               131584\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    dropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 128)               0\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    output (Dense)               (None, 86)                11094\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    activation_1 (Activation)    (None, 86)                0\n\nExamples\n========\n\nI’ve distributed the binary weights and models used to generate these\nsegments which can be found in the ``models`` directory.\n\nThe Illiad of Homer\n-------------------\n\n::\n\n    BOOK II.\n\n\n    Heckees, Sestos and Adresteia draw as he              100\n      Horden arms by this beast guard killed.\n      Ark, though batch offered the cues.\n      Is mine enchanted his wrist kingly watch\n      Threatened benefit of his knee is these.\n      Caring wet table to be bespoke herself              420\n      For battle, damed us them spoken I deemed.\n      Nor purpiring in neck he well-armown,\n      Ilium I rathor!
