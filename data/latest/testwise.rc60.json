Difficult to comprehend. I tried to explain the use of the library with examples as best I could. But writing such automation is quite complex.\nThere may still be errors. It is pretty difficult to check but I'm trying to improve the usage.\n\n## Example Usage\n```python\n# Testwise is a backtester library that requires some coding knowledge\n# There is no cli or interface. \n# You should directly execute necessary functions like enter_long() or exit_short()\n# This is a backtesting example of Exponential Moving Average cross strategy.\n# There is a 1.5 ATR stop loss level and a 1 ATR take profit level for every position. \n# Commission rate is 0.1000%. \n# Margin usage is allowed up to 5 times the main capital.\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom testwise import Testwise\nimport requests\nfrom legitindicators import ema, atr\n\n# In this example, daily BTCUSDT kline data is used from binance\n# Let's say you want to backtest your strategy for about 450 days.\n# It would be useful to add some extra days to the specified time interval\n# for the indicators to work properly.\n# (For example 10 days of EMA won't be calculated for the first 9 days of time range)\n# In this example I add 40 extra days. This value can be determined by assigning the TRIM variable\nTRIM = 40\nBINANCE_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nSYMBOL = \"BTCUSDT\"\nINTERVAL = \"1d\"\n\n# These are the initial paramters for backtester.\n# You can find a more detailed explanation where the Testwise definition is given below.\nCOMMISSION = 0.001\nDYNAMIC_POSITIONING = True\nMARGIN_FACTOR = 5\nLIMIT_FACTOR = 1\nRISK_FACTOR = 1.5\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Here we define the start time and end time of backtesting.\n    # Notice usage of TRIM variable to start to backtest a few days earlier for proper indicator use.\n    start_time = datetime(2020, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n    start_time = start_time - timedelta(days=TRIM)\n\n    end_time = datetime(2021, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n\n    # In this example, timestamps are used.
