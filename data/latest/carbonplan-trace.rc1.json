Nothing here is final or complete.\n\nWe have completed the scripts and notebooks for delivery of version 0 of the dataset (`carbonplan_trace/v0`) which largely reproduces and extends work by Zarin et al (2016) as hosted on the Global Forest Watch platform.\n\nInput datasets include:\n* aboveground biomass for year 2000 (Zarin et al., 2016)\n* binary masks of tree cover loss year for 2001-2020 (Hansen et al (2013))\n* Suomi NPP (VIIRS) Fire Masks for 2011-2020 (Schroeder et al., 2014)\n* country boundary shapefile from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) version 3.6. *Note: Geopolitical boundaries that have changed over the period of record will be tagged to the static country designation as defined in GADM v3.6.*\n\nSome tips for reproducing this effort:\n\n* The `scripts/aggregate_emissions.v0.py` script can be run to reproduce both the 3 km global emissions raster dataset and the country-average estimates. As a warning, depending on the size of the machine you're running on, you might encounter memory issues when dealing with the 30m datasets. For that reason, we opted to process the 30m tiles in serial. If you are struggling, you might want to check to ensure that your cluster isn't getting overloaded.\n* We recommend using the sample notebook `notebooks/blogpost_sample_notebook.ipynb` as a starting point to introduce yourself to the structure of the data and how to work with a high resolution global product. We emphasize that the 3km product may be sufficient for some users.\n\n## license\n\nAll the code in this repository is [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) licensed.
