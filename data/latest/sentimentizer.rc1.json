    "description": "# Introduction\n\n[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sentimentizer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/sentimentizer/)\n![GitHub CI](https://github.com/eddiepyang/sentimentizer/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)\n  \nBeta release, api subject to change. Install with:  \n\n```\npip install sentimentizer\n```  \n  \nThis repo contains Neural Nets written with the pytorch framework for sentiment analysis.  \nA LSTM based torch model can be found in the rnn folder. In spite of large language models (GPT3.5 as of 2023) \ndominating the conversation, small models can be pretty effective and are nice to learn from. This model focuses on sentiment analysis and was trained on \na single gpu in minutes and requires less than 1GB of memory.\n\n  \n## Usage\n```\n# where 0 is very negative and 1 is very positive\nfrom sentimentizer.tokenizer import get_trained_tokenizer\nfrom sentimentizer.rnn.model import get_trained_model\n\nmodel = get_trained_model(64, 'cpu')\ntokenizer = get_trained_tokenizer()\nreview_text = \"greatest pie ever, best in town!\"\npositive_ids = tokenizer.tokenize_text(review_text)\nmodel.predict(positive_ids)\n  \n>> tensor(0.9701)\n```\n\n## Install for development with miniconda:  \n```\nconda create -n {env}  \nconda install pip  \npip install -e .  \n```\n\n## Retrain model\nTo rerun the model:\n* get the yelp [dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), \n* get the glove 6B 100D [dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)\n* place both files in the package data directory \n* run the training script in workflows\n\n",
