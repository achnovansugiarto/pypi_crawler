    "description": "# Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2x) Open Test Systems \r\n\r\nThis repository contains open grid network models and modeling scripts to \r\ntest and compare different factors/measures (e.g., technoeconomic, social, \r\nequity, and engineering) that examine practices and policies for \r\ninterconnection queue management and cost allocation.  This repository is \r\nused for engineering training bootcamps, interconnection study guides, and \r\nan interconnection roadmap for the [i2x project](https://energy.gov/i2x).  \r\n\r\n## Users\r\n\r\nThe i2x DER package has been tested on Windows only, with Python 3.10.  It \r\ndoes net yet support Mac OS X or Linux.  During the installation process, \r\na version of OpenDSS will be installed to work with the Python interface, \r\ni.e., you do not have to install OpenDSS separately.  The steps are: \r\n\r\n1. Install Python 3 if necessary. This is available from [Python Site](https://python.org), [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), or the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).\r\n2. On the second panel of Python 3's installer, select the option that adds Python variables to your system environment, which includes the _path_.\r\n3. From a command prompt[^1], `pip install i2x --upgrade`\r\n\r\nOnce installed, invoke the GUI from a command prompt[^1]: `i2x-der`\r\n\r\nSources of background information include:\r\n\r\n1. Slides from the first DER interconnection study boot camp, \r\n   [PNNL](doc/DER_Bootcamp_Circuits.pdf) and [NRECA](doc/NRECA_Bootcamp%20slides_v2.pdf).\r\n2. [CIGRE Canada Paper](https://cigre.ca/papers/2021/paper%20460.pdf) on\r\n   hosting capacity analysis methods, focused on North America.\r\n3. [Multi-country Survey of Hosting Capacity](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4756)\r\n\r\n### User Interface\r\n\r\nWhen you start the program, six tabbed pages appear in a notebook format:\r\n\r\n1. **Network** shows an overview map of the circuit selected from a library.\r\n   Buses are labeled when they have either a substation source, or DER at\r\n   least 100 kW in size. X and Y coordinates are arbitrary.  You can pan and\r\n   zoom this map using the toolbar, but can not modify it or obtain more data\r\n   from it.  A key to the legend is:\r\n   - LN = line segment\r\n   - XFM = transformer segment\r\n   - REG = voltage regulator segment\r\n   - SWT = switch segment\r\n   - NWP = network protector segment\r\n   - RCT = series reactor segment\r\n   - SUB = substation\r\n   - GEN = (conventional) generator\r\n   - PV = photovoltaic generator\r\n   - CAP = capacitor bank\r\n   - BAT = battery, i.e., storage\r\n2. **DER** summarizes DER and load on the circuit. _kVA_ refers to the size,\r\n   while _kW_ refers to the requested output. The _Available Residential Rooftops_\r\n   include single-phase load points without existing DER, with 120/240-volt service.\r\n   You can choose a percentage of these to populate with new PV each time a case\r\n   is run. The size at each location depends on local load:\r\n   - The PV size matches the local load size, rounded to the nearest 5 kW.\r\n   - When the rounded PV size is 0 kW, the minimum size is 3 kW instead.\r\n   The rooftop locations change each time due to randomization, which usually produces a slight\r\n   variation when you repeat a case, unless you set the useage rate to 0%. You can change\r\n   the _kW_, _kvar_, and even the _type_ of existing large DER, but you can't add new\r\n   large DER at a different location. You can effectively remove DER by setting _kW_ to 0.\r\n3. **Solar** offers a choice of time-dependent solar output profiles, which apply to\r\n   each PV in the circuit.\r\n4. **Loads** offers a choice of time-dependent load output profiles, which apply to\r\n   each load in the circuit. You can also apply a global scaling factor to the loads, which\r\n   acts along with the load profile.\r\n5. **Inverters** offers a choice of 7 inverter functions that respond to voltage, which apply\r\n   uniformly to every PV and storage inverter in the circuit. Please see IEEE 1547 and its\r\n   application guides for more details. The _Power Factor_ applies to both _CONSTANT\\_PF_ and\r\n   _VOLT\\_WATT_ modes. Enter a negative number to absorb reactive power, positive to inject\r\n   reactive power. In other modes, the red curve shows how reactive power varies in response\r\n   to voltage.\r\n6. **Output** allows you to run a simulation and view the results. Click the blue **Run** button\r\n   to run a new case. The other widgets on this page are:\r\n   - _Solution Mode_ should be _DAILY_ for a 24-hour simulation using the _pcloud_ or _pclear_ \r\n     solar profile. Use _DUTY_ with the _pvduty_ solar profile to focus on rapid voltage regulator\r\n     and capacitor switching response. Less often, use _SNAPSHOT_ to run a single power flow, with\r\n     limited results shown.\r\n   - _Control Mode_ should be _STATIC_. Change this only if you are familiar with how it works\r\n     in OpenDSS.\r\n   - _Stop Time_ specifies how long a period will be simulated. 1440 minutes covers one day, while\r\n     48 minutes covers the _pvduty_ solar profile.\r\n   - _Time Step_ specifies the period between each power flow solution. There is a tradeoff between\r\n     precision of the voltage fluctuations, and the simulation time. The software requires a value\r\n     from 1 to 300, inclusive.\r\n   - _Output PV Details_ will show the production and voltage results for each PV in the circuit.\r\n     There may be a lot of these, especially on residential roof tops.\r\n   - _Clear Old Output_ will erase prior results before displaying new ones. This is the default, so\r\n     new results appear right at the top whenever you run a new case. If you unselect this option,\r\n     please remember to scroll down to the bottom of the results each time you run a new case. The\r\n     advantage is that you will now have a log of all cases run. Use copy-and-paste to another program\r\n     to save any of these results.\r\n   - **_Summary Results_** is a row of labels that will show in **_red_** when important limits are violated\r\n     in the simulation results. See below for more details.\r\n   - _Detailed Results_ appear in the large white area below the other widgets, categorized as follows:\r\n     - _Number of Capacitor Switchings_: the number of times a capacitor bank switched on or off. Expect no more than 2 per capacitor bank per day. If higher, PV fluctuations may be the cause.\r\n     - _Number of Tap Changes_: the total number of voltage regulator tap movements. Expect one or two dozen per day per regulator. If higher, PV fluctuations may be the cause.\r\n     - _Number of Relay Trips_: if not zero, PV reverse power flow may be the cause. Any time a relay trips, some load has likely lost service. Furthermore, the following voltage and energy results may be unreliable. \r\n       When this is not zero, the DER hosting capacity limit has been exceeded.\r\n     - _Nodes with Low Voltage_: how many node voltages fell below the ANSI C84.1 A Range, i.e., 0.95 perunit\r\n     - _Nodes with High Voltage_: how many node voltages fell above the ANSI C84.1 A Range, i.e., 1.05 perunit \r\n     - _Load Served_: total energy delivered to loads in the circuit\r\n     - _Substation Energy_: total energy from the substation, i.e., the bulk electric system\r\n     - _Losses_: total losses in lines and transformers\r\n     - _Generation_: total energy from conventional generation\r\n     - _Solar Output_: total real power production from PV\r\n     - _Solar Reactive Energy_: total reactive power production from PV, in response to local voltage\r\n     - _Energy Exceeding Normal_: EEN is an estimate of the load energy delivered under conditions of voltage outside normal limits,\r\n       and/or conditions of line or transformer current above normal limits. This may indicate the need for grid infrastructure\r\n       upgrades. It indicates that a DER hosting capacity limit has been exceeded. See the OpenDSS documentation for more details.\r\n     - _Unserved Energy_: UE is defined like EEN, but with emergency limits rather than normal limits. Load would not\r\n       be disconnected, but non-zero UE is a stronger indication that grid upgrades are needed, that DER hosting capacity has been\r\n       exceeded, and that operational problems are more likely.\r\n     - _Minimum PV Voltage_: among all PV, in per-unit. \r\n     - _Maximum PV Voltage_: among all PV, in per-unit.\r\n     - _Maximum PV Voltage Change_: the voltage change, in percent, is measured as the largest difference in PV voltage magnitude\r\n       between consecutive time points. There is some sensitivity to the choice of _Time Step_. In more detailed OpenDSS\r\n       modeling, signal processing techniques are applied to mitigate the sensitivity, but for illustrative purposes in the _i2x-der_\r\n       software, that's not necessary. The voltage change, _Vdiff_, should be limited to 2% or 3%, depending on the local electric\r\n       utility guidelines. Otherwise, nearby customers may complain. The _Vdiff_ results consider only the PV locations, as the\r\n       load _Vdiff_ values should all be equal to or less than the worst PV value. The use of inverter control modes could\r\n       mitigate _Vdiff_ without having to reduce the amount of DER.\r\n     - _PV Details_: if requested, shows the real and reactive energies, and the voltage results, for each PV in the model.\r\n   - _Check for Updates_ will compare your installed software version to the latest on PyPi. Requires an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nSome other important notes about the program:\r\n\r\n- The main window is resizable. The graphs and the output results display may increase in size.\r\n- Close the program by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.\r\n- As you run simulations, some logging messages appear in the Command Prompt. You don't\r\n  need to pay attention to these, unless an error occurs. If there is an error message,\r\n  please copy-and-paste the message into your issue report.\r\n- Please report any comments, suggestions, or errors on the [issues page](https://github.com/pnnl/i2x/issues).\r\n  Before submitting a new issue, check the others listed to see if the problem or suggestion\r\n  has already been reported.  If it has, you might still add new information to the existing\r\n  issue as a comment. The issues page is better than emailing for this purpose, as it helps \r\n  the team organize these reports and updates. It also creates a public record that may help\r\n  other users.\r\n\r\n### Examples: 9500-Node Network\r\n\r\nWhen you first start _i2x-der_, the [IEEE 9500 node circuit](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-33471.pdf) is displayed.\r\nWe can use this to examine the effect of inverter controls on solar-induced voltage fluctuations:\r\n\r\n- Go to the **DER** tab, and reduce the usage of residential rooftops to 0%. This\r\n  makes the results repeatable.\r\n- Go the the **Output** tab and run a case. You should find the maximum PV voltage fluctuation\r\n  to be at or near 0.8656%. This is less than 2%, and should be acceptable, but that's on a clear day.\r\n- Go to the **Solar** tab and select the **pcloud** profile. The graph shows much more variation\r\n  in output. Use this profile for the rest of the example. If you run the case again, the\r\n  voltage fluctuation should exceed 3%, which is not acceptable.\r\n- Go to the **Inverters** tab and try non-unity power factors, e.g., 0.9 and -0.9. One of these\r\n  improves the voltage fluctuation, while one makes it worse. Both choices result in significant\r\n  levels of PV reactive energy.\r\n- On the **Inverters** tab, try the _VOLT\\_WATT_ function, which is designed to mitigate steady-state\r\n  voltage rise. It doesn't affect the voltage fluctuations in this case, i.e., you should get approximately\r\n  the same result as you did with the same power factor in _CONSTANT\\_PF_ mode. The IEEE 9500-node\r\n  circuit doesn't have significant voltage rise problems, even if you were to add much more PV.\r\n- On the **Inverters** tab, try the other functions. Results are tabulated below.\r\n  - _VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATA_ has a small beneficial effect, but it's not very aggressive in using reactive power. \r\n  - _VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATB_ is more aggressive, but only outside a \"deadband\" of zero response \r\n    (see its graph). In this case, the voltage fluctuations occur mostly within the deadband, which spans 4%.\r\n  - _VOLT\\_VAR\\_AVR_ uses the most aggressive response allowed in IEEE 1547-2018, along with \"autonomously\r\n    adjusting reference voltage\" as described on page 39 of IEEE 1547-2018. There is no deadband, but the\r\n    setpoint is not fixed at 1 perunit reference voltage. Instead, the se_VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATB_ point follows the grid voltage with \r\n    a response time of several minutes. The effect is to resist sudden voltage changes, while not resisting\r\n    longer term changes in grid voltage. In this case, it reduces the voltage fluctuation below 2%, and the\r\n    PV reactive energy is only 0.80% of the PV real energy. There are higher short-term transients in PV reactive\r\n    power, but over the day these net to nearly zero. On the other hand, the _CONSTANT\\_PF_ result with -0.9\r\n    power factor also reduced the voltage fluctuation below 2%, but the PV reactive energy was 48.4% of the PV\r\n    real energy, i.e., the PV absorbed reactive power all the time.\r\n  - _VOLT\\_VAR\\_VOLT\\_WATT_ uses both _VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATB_ and _VOLT\\_WATT_, at unity power factor. Because of the\r\n    deadband, it doesn't help with voltage fluctuations in this case.\r\n  - _VOLT\\_VAR\\_14H_ uses both volt-var and volt-watt characteristics according to Hawaii Rule 14H, which was\r\n    developed for an area that has high steady-state voltage rise on some long secondary circuits. The volt-watt\r\n    characteristic is more aggressive, but the volt-var characteristic has a wider deadband, of 6%. As a result,\r\n    it helps even less with voltage fluctuations in this case.\r\n  - Although not illustrated here, _VOLT\\_VAR\\_AVR_ may be combined with _VOLT\\_WATT_ to address steady-state\r\n    voltage rise along with voltage fluctuations. This is the same combination in IEEE 1547-2018 that allows\r\n    the _VOLT\\_VAR\\_VOLT\\_WATT_ and _VOLT\\_VAR\\_14H_ modes.\r\n\r\n| Profile | Inverters | Max Vdiff [%] | Notes |\r\n| ------- | --------- | -----: | ------------|\r\n| pclear | CONSTANT\\_PF=1.0 | 0.8656 | No problem on a clear day. |\r\n| pcloud | CONSTANT\\_PF=1.0 | 3.1382 | With clouds, too much voltage fluctuation. |\r\n| pcloud | CONSTANT\\_PF=0.9 | 4.5609 | Injecting reactive power makes it worse. |\r\n| pcloud | CONSTANT\\_PF=-0.9 | 1.6858 | Absorbing reactive power all the time. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_WATT, PF=-0.9 | 1.6999 | Close to CONSTANT\\_PF result at same power factor. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATA | 2.8752 | Helps a little. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_VAR\\_CATB | 3.0721 | No help in the deadband. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_VAR\\_AVR | 1.5747 | Setpoint adjusts to grid voltage over several minutes. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_VAR\\_VOLT\\_WATT | 3.0721 | Still no help in the deadband. |\r\n| pcloud | VOLT\\_VAR\\_14H | 3.1209 | Still no help in the deadband. |\r\n\r\nSuggested exercises for this circuit:\r\n\r\n- Add more residential rooftop PV without exceeding the hosting capacity.\r\n- Use the _pvduty_ solar profile to explore the effects of inverter control mode on regulator tap changes.\r\n- Use the **DER** tab to replace as much of the conventional generation as possible with PV. How could you\r\n  quantify the effect on local air quality?\r\n- Use the **DER** tab to increase the existing _pvfarm1_ size as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Examples: Low-Voltage Secondary Network\r\n\r\nThe second available circuit is an [IEEE Low-Voltage Network Test System](https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939794).\r\nIt comprises 8 radial primary feeders that supply a grid of 480-V and 208-V secondary cables in an urban, downtown area.\r\nThis design provides economic, high-reliability service to dense load areas, but it does not support very much DER.\r\nThe network protectors (NWP) trip on reverse power flow, as intended for faults on a primary feeder. DER can also cause\r\nNWP trips under normal conditions, which is not intended. To explore this effect:\r\n\r\n- On the **Network** tab, select _ieee\\_lvn_ and review the locations of NWP with respect to the primary feeders and\r\n  the secondary grid. There are 8 fixed PV locations indicated in yellow. In a dense urban area like this, there are\r\n  no available residential rooftops for single-phase PV.\r\n- On the **DER** tab, the PV are dispatched to a total of 800 kW, which is only 1.9% of the peak load. IEEE 1547.6-2011,\r\n  which is an application guide for DER on secondary network systems, refers to such a limit as \"de minimus\".\r\n- On the **Output** tab, run the case. There should be no voltage problems because of the strong grid, and no relay trips\r\n  because of the \"de minimus\" quantity of DER.\r\n- On the **DER** tab, change each DER to dispatch at 1000 kW, as might have been intended for 1095 kva ratings. This is\r\n  still only 19% of the peak load.\r\n- On the **Output** tab, run the case again. Now, you should see 4 relay trips, and some of the loads are unserved. Two\r\n  of the eight PV were also disconnected. This result is not acceptable.\r\n- On the **DER** tab, adjust the individual DER kW and kva parameters to achieve as high a hosting capacity as possible.\r\n- Some changes to the traditional NWP scheme have been investigated to increase the DER hosting capacity, but these\r\n  are advanced topics and not considered in the _i2x-der_ software.\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with `git` and Python is expected.  Experience with OpenDSS is \r\nalso helpful.  The steps for working on the i2x Python code are: \r\n\r\n1. From your local directory of software projects: `git clone https://github.com/pnnl/i2x.git`\r\n2. `cd i2x`\r\n3. `pip install -e .` to install i2x from your local copy of the code.\r\n\r\nThe steps for deployment to PyPi are:\r\n\r\n1. `rm -rf dist`\r\n2. `python -m build`\r\n3. `twine check dist/*` should not show any errors\r\n4. `twine upload -r testpypi dist/*` requires project credentials for i2x on test.pypi.org\r\n5. `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ i2x==0.0.8` for local testing of the deployable package, example version 0.0.8\r\n6. `twine upload dist/*` final deployment; requires project credentials for i2x on pypi.org\r\n\r\n## Bulk Electric System (BES) Test Cases\r\n\r\nTwo BES test systems are under development at [CIMHub/BES](https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/CIMHub/tree/feature/SETO/BES).\r\nThese will be used in BES boot camps and i2x sprint studies.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee [License](license.txt)\r\n\r\n## Notice\r\n\r\nThis material was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of the United States Government.
