    "description": "---\ntitle: python-axel\n---\n\n[![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/python_hide_my_name.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python_hide_my_name)\n\nI know how much of a struggle it is to find working proxies. Even the best websites sometimes give you proxies that don't work! So I made python-hide-my-name.\nAutomatically finds proxies from hidemy.name, tests them, and only gives you the ones that actually work!\n\n-   Free software: MIT license\n-   Documentation: <https://python-hide-my-name.readthedocs.io>.\n\n# Features\n\nTests a single proxy for you!\nFetches as many proxies as you want for you! (Multithreading applied here. So yes it's fast!)\nTests those proxies! (Multithreading applied here as well. A lot less IO bottleneck!)\nReturns the ones that do work!\n\n# Credits\n\nThis package was coded in it\\'s entirety by Aria Bagheri. But you can always contribute if you want! Just fork the project, have your go at it, and then submit a pull request!\nSpecial thanks to hidemy.name. Without their amazing work, this project would not be here!\nIt is worth mentioning that hidemy.name regularly removes broken proxies from their website and their website is constantly updated with new proxies thanks to their ingenious 'spider robot'. \nBut between their proxy check intervals, there are proxies breaking and it is simply not feasible for them to update evey second. \nThat's where this tool comes in handy.\n",
