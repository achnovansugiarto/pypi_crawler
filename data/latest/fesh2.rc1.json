    "description": "# Fesh2: Geodetic VLBI schedule file management and processing\n\n## What is it?\n\n**Fesh2** is a Python package that provides automated schedule file preparation.\nIt requires an installation of the\n[NASA Field System](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs).\n\n**Fesh2** runs in a terminal window and regularly checks IVS schedule\nrepositories for new or updated versions of Master files and schedule files for\none or more specified stations. A check for the latest version of the Master\nfile(s) is done first, but skipped if the time since the last check is less than\na specified amount.\nSimilarly, checks on schedule files are only done if the time since the last\ncheck exceeds a specified time. If new or updated schedules are found, they are\noptionally processed with **Drudg**\nto produce `snp`, `prc` and `lst` files. By default, once the files have been\nchecked, **fesh2** will provide a summary and then go into a wait state before\ncarrying out another check. **Fesh2** can also be run once for a single \ncheck or\nstatus report and not go into a wait state. **Fesh2** can also be run \nin a `monit` mode that gives a continually updating status report but \ndoes not process any files. Multiple \ninstances can be run\nsimultaneously. If drudg output (`snp` or `prc\n` files) have been modified by the user and a new schedule becomes available\n, **fesh2** will download the file but not overwrite Drudg output, but it will\nwarn the user.\n\n**Fesh2** can be run as a foreground application or as a service in the\nbackground.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n**Fesh2** code is compatible with Python versions 3.8 and above. ***Note that **fesh2** is not compatible with \nPython version 2.***\n\nNote that if you're \nusing an old version of Debian (Jessie or earlier) then you will need to \ninstall python 3.8 or higher by hand. This could be done inside a virtual \nenvironment by a user or on the system as root.\n\n## Installation\n\n\n**Fesh2** is a stand-alone add-on to the \n[Field System](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs) so installation must be \ncarried out separately.\n\n### PycURL dependency\n\n**Fesh2** depends on the python CURL\nlibrary ([PycURL](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html))\nwhich should be installed automatically when you install fesh2. However, PycURL\ndepends on the Python development libraries, and it won't install if they're not\nthere. On a Debian machine, \n\n    apt-get install python3-dev\n\nshould do the trick. You may also need these: \n\n    apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev\n\nPlease make sure the above dependencies are satisfied before proceeding.\n\nInstallation should be carried out under the `prog` account. You may wish to \ninstall fesh2 within a python virtual environment, but regardless, the \ninstallation commands are the same:\n\n#### Installing with pip:\nRun the following:\n   ```\npip install fesh2   \n```\nYou will then need to edit the **fesh2** configuration file for your station(s). More information on configuration is provided below.\n\nA template configuration file `fesh2.config` is provided in [the fesh2 GitHub \nrepository](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fesh2/) and a copy of the contents is \nin the Appendix at the end of this document. `fesh2.config` should be \n placed in `/usr2/control` and edited to suit your site.\n\n## Configuration\n**Fesh2** will take its configuration in the following priority order from\nlowest to highest:\n\n* Two config files, in this order:\n    * `/usr2/control/skedf.ctl`\n    * `/usr2/control/fesh2.config`\n* Environment variables\n* Command-line parameters\n\nNote that Fesh2 will only run Drudg if it DoDrudg is set to True and it is\nconfigured appropriately. See the Drudg notes below.\n\nIf you have the configuration files in a different location to `/usr2/control`,\nuse the command-line options `--ConfigFile` and `--SkedConfigFile` to set them\nappropriately.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment variables are recognised by **fesh2**:\n\n* `NETRC_FILE` and `COOKIES_FILE`: the locations of the `.netrc` and\n  `.urs_cookies\n  ` files, used by CURL for the https protocol. Curl sets these to files in the\n  home directory by default. More information is given below on Curl\n  configuration.\n* `LIST_DIR` : the directory where **drudg** puts `.lst` output files. If this\n  is not set, then the `LstDir` parameter in `fesh2.config` is used if set.\n  Otherwise **drudg** defaults to the `$schedules` parameter in `skedf.ctl`\n\nA number of environment variables used by **drudg** are also recognised by \n**fesh2**. See the **drudg** section below.  The \nfollowing \nenvironment variables are _NOT_ recognised by **fesh2**:\n\n* `STATION` is used in the Field System but not recognised by **fesh2** as it is\n  possible to configure **fesh2** to manage schedules for multiple stations .\n  The `Stations` parameter _must_ be set in `fesh2.config`\n\n### The fesh2 configuration file\n\nOn startup, **fesh2** looks for a configuration file called `fesh2.config`. \n*This will need to be set up for your station before running **fesh2** for the\nfirst time.* Use your favourite text editor to modify the file. The comments in\nthe file describe the parameters but here are a few points to note:\n\n#### Station settings\n\nYou will want to edit options in the `[Station]` section to configure which\nstations you want to process, what types of Master and schedule files you want\nto obtain, how far into the future you want to search for schedule files and how\noften you want to look for them.\n\n#### Email\n\nIf enabled, notification can be sent via email when:\n\n* a new schedule has been downloaded\n* a schedule file has been updated on the server, downloaded and needs manual\n  processing\n\n#### Drudg\n\nAfter finding and downloading a new or updated schedule, **Fesh2** can\noptionally run **Drudg** to produce new snp, prc and lst files. The `[Drudg]`\nsection allows you to configure this behaviour. If you don't want **fesh2** to\nautomatically process your schedules, this feature con be turned off by\nsetting `DodDrudg` to `False`.\n\nBecause **fesh2** manages schedule files and uses **drudg** to process them, and\nto keep things consistent across the Field System, it will use settings\nin `skedf.ctl`. However, there are some caveats regarding `skedf.ctl` for the\ncase where there is not an overriding definition:\n\n* **Fesh2** requires that `$schedules` is defined in `skedf.ctl`. The default\n  of '.' (i.e. the directory the software is started in) is too arbitrary and\n  could cause **fesh2** to lose track of files.\n* If `$snap` or `$proc` are not defined, then they will be set to the same as\n  `$schedules`\n\nDrudg may have been configured such that the user is prompted for a response, in\nwhich case it cannot be automated. If this is the case, then Drudg will not be\nrun on SKD files.\n\nIf you want Fesh2 to automatically process SKD files, then some configuration is required. Fesh2 will get it's configuration information as follows, in\nthis priority order (lowest to highest):\n\n1. Fesh2 will first look in `/usr2/control/skedf.ctl`. Unless parameters are\n   changed, Fesh2 will not run Drudg if the following parameters are set as\n   shown:\n    * `tpicd YES`\n    * `vsi_align ASK`\n    * `cont_cal ASK`\n    * `cont_cal_polarity ASK`\n\n2. Fesh2 will then look for any configuration parameters in the `[Drudg]`\n   secoion of `fesh2.config`. These parameters can be different to `skedf.ctl`\n   in case you want Drudg to behave differently when Fesh2 is running it for you\n\n3. There are some `FESH` environment variables which can be set and these will\n   override skedf.ctl or this file if they are. These environment variables are\n   as follows with the lowest supported version of Drudge shown in brackets (text from FS documentation):\n    * `FESH_GEO_TPICD` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values are\n      non-negative integers. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the\n      drudg prompt for the tpicd interval for geodesy schedules.\n    * `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values\n      are `on` or `off`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the\n      drudg prompt for continuous cal use for geodesy schedules.\n    * `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible\n      values are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3,` or `none`. If set, the value is provided as\n      the answer for the drudg prompt for the continuous cal polarity for\n      geodesy schedules.\n    * `FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values\n      are `0`, `1`, or `none`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for\n      the drudg prompt for using vsi_align for geodesy schedules.\n    * `FESH_GEO_USE_SETUP_PROC` *(10.1.0, 2021)* Possible values are `yes`\n      or `no`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the drudg prompt\n      for the *\"use setup_proc\"* for geodesy schedules, an option to write\n      a `.snp` file that skips setup on scans when the mode hasnâ€™t changed.\n    * `FESH_GEO_VDIF_SINGLE_THREAD_PER_FILE` *(10.1.0, 2021)* Possible values\n      are `yes` or `no`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the\n      drudg prompt for the *\"VDIF single thread per file\"* for geodesy\n      schedules.\n\n4. Lastly, if any Drudg-related command-line parameters are set, they will\n   override everything else\n\n*If any Drudg settings recieved by Fesh2 require manual intervention, Drudg will\nnot be run on the SKD files.*\n\n#### Servers\n\nThe `[Servers]` section allows you to list all the IVS schedule file servers you\nwant to search and the protocols to use for each. Specify the location of the\ntop directory (i.e. the `vlbi` directory). Protocols known to work are https (\nsecure HTTP), ftp (anonymous FTP) and ftps (secure (SSL) anonymous FTP).\n\n#### Curl\n\n**Fesh2** uses [curl](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html) to access files\non the servers. If https is being used\n(e.g. to access the CDDIS repository), then **fesh2** needs to know the location\nof your `.netrc` and (\noptionally) `.urs_cookies` files. Curl puts these in the user's home directory\nby default but they can be placed elsewhere if desired. This can be set on the\ncommand line or via the NETRC_FILE and COOKIES_FILE environment variables (\nsee above\n) or in the **fesh2** config file by setting the NetrcFile and CookiesFile\nparameters.\n\n## Usage\n\n**Fesh2** can be started by just typing\n```\nfesh2\n```\n\nwhich starts it in its default mode. **fesh2** can also be run in monitoring \nmode in a terminal window by typing:\n```\nfesh2 --monit\n```\n*Note: If you run **fesh2** as multiple instances but with different \nconfiguration (e.g. running it in the background with SnapDir set on the \ncommand line, then running it as a monitor with the default SNAP file \ndirectory) then you may see some unexpected behaviour. In the above \nexample, a schedule could be generated by drudg in the non-default SNAP \ndirectory but ```fesh2 --monit``` would think that the schedule hadn't \nbeen processed.*\n\nCommand-line options exist to change many of the configuration parameters, allow\nfor a one-off checks\n(no wait mode), forcing of file downloads etc. Some common usages are:\n\n* Only consider the current or next experiment\n```\nfesh2 -n\n```\n* Just run once then exit, don't go into a wait loop\n```\nfesh2 --once\n```\n* Just get a schedule for a specified session, then exit. e.g.:\n```\nfesh2 --once -g r1456\n```\n* Force an update to the schedule file when there's a new one available to\n  replace the old one. The default behaviour is to give the new file the name\n  ```<code>.skd.new``` and prompt the user to take action. The file will also be\n  drudged if the DoDrudg option is True\n```\nfesh2 --update\n```\n* Obtain schedule files, but don't process them:\n```\nfesh2 --DoDrudg False\n```\n* Get a status report. Shows the status of schedule files and when schedule\n  servers were last queried.\n```\nfesh2 --check\n```\n* Run fesh2 with all terminal output suppressed. Useful when running fesh2 as a\n  service.\n```\nfesh2 --quiet\n```\nAll command-line parameters are as follows:\n```\nusage:       fesh2 [-h] [-c CONFIGFILE] [-k SKEDCONFIGFILE] [-g GET] [-m] [-u]\n                   [-n] [-a] [-o] [--update] [--SchedDir SCHEDDIR]\n                   [--ProcDir PROCDIR] [--SnapDir SNAPDIR] [--LstDir LSTDIR]\n                   [--LogDir LOGDIR] [--Stations [STATIONS [STATIONS ...]]]\n                   [--EmailNotifications [EMAILNOTIFICATIONS]]\n                   [--GetMaster [GETMASTER]]\n                   [--GetMasterIntensive [GETMASTERINTENSIVE]]\n                   [--SchedTypes [SCHEDTYPES [SCHEDTYPES ...]]]\n                   [-t MASTERCHECKTIME] [-s SCHEDULECHECKTIME]\n                   [-l LOOKAHEADTIMEDAYS] [-d [DODRUDG]]\n                   [--DrudgBinary DRUDGBINARY] [--TpiPeriod TPIPERIOD]\n                   [--VsiAlign VSIALIGN] [--ContCalAction CONTCALACTION]\n                   [--ContCalPolarity CONTCALPOLARITY] [--SetupProc SETUPPROC]\n                   [--VdifSingleThreadPerFile VDIFSINGLETHREADPERFILE]\n                   [--Servers [SERVERS [SERVERS ...]]] [--NetrcFile NETRCFILE]\n                   [--CookiesFile COOKIESFILE]\n                   [--CurlSecLevel1 [CURLSECLEVEL1]] [-y YEAR] [-e] [--monit]\n                   [-q]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c CONFIGFILE, --ConfigFile CONFIGFILE\n                        The fesh2 configuration file to use. e.g.\n                        /usr2/control/fesh2.config\n  -k SKEDCONFIGFILE, --SkedConfigFile SKEDCONFIGFILE\n                        The location of the skedf.cfg configuration file\n  -g GET, --get GET     Just get a schedule for this specified session.

Useful\n                        when running fesh2 as a service.\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nAs well as writing information to the screen on activity, **fesh2** also keeps a\nlog of activity in the Field System log directory (by default) at\n`/usr2/log/fesh2.log`. The log file location can be configured in `fesh2.config`\n\n## Running fesh2 as a service\n\nFesh2 can be run in the background as a `systemd` service. All output is\nsuppressed and status is available by examining the log file or using the\n`--check` or `-e` flag. Here's how to set it up from the superuser account for\nDebian Jessie or later:\n\n1. Type the following command to add a `systemd` service:\n    ```\n   systemctl edit --force --full fesh2.service\n   ```\n   This should open a text editor. Paste in the following:\n    ```\n   [Unit]\n   Description=Fesh2 Service\n   After=network-online.target\n   Wants=network-online.target\n   \n   [Service]\n   ExecStart=/usr/bin/sudo -H -u oper /usr/local/bin/fesh2 --quiet\n   \n   [Install]\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n   ```\n   Save and exit. This will configure `systemd` to start fesh2, running as user\n   oper and suppress all output.\n2. Enable the service:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl enable fesh2.service\n    ```\n3. Check the status of the service:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl status fesh2.service\n    ```\n4. You can stop, start and query the service:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl stop fesh2.service          # Stop running the service \n    sudo systemctl start fesh2.service         # Start running the service \n    sudo systemctl restart fesh2.service       # Restart the service \n    ```\n5. To see the current schedule file status (as user oper):\n    ```\n   fesh2 --check\n   ```\n\nIf you would prefer to set this up as a user service, some notes are here:\n* https://www.unixsysadmin.com/systemd-user-services/\n\nFor versions of Debian older thean Jessie (e.g. Wheezy), systemd can be enabled\nand some notes are here:\n* https://scottlinux.com/2014/10/20/how-to-switch-to-systemd-on-debian-wheezy/\n\n# Appendix A: fesh2.config\n\n```\n# Fesh2 configuration file.\n#\n# Note: all non-essential parameters (i.e. those with defaults) are commented out\n#\n# Field System directories\n[FS]\n  # Log directory.
