    "description": "Background\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of time (the 90s), `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_\r\nhas stood as the pinnacle of centralized Python packaging.  Everytime an\r\n`easy_install` or a `pip` command is run, PyPI is servicing a request, routing\r\nyou to the correct version, architecture, etc., of the package you requested.\r\nIts very flexible--even allowing package authors to host packages both to PyPI\r\n*and* their personal web sites.\r\n\r\n...which is all fine and dandy, until these third-party web sites run into\r\nproblems.  Infinite loops due to randomly generated URLs names causing DDoS\r\nattacks, slow download speeds, missing files, and downtime, all affect the end\r\nuser's experience.  While `pip` seeks to address some of these issues, the\r\nplain and simple fact of the matter is: **PyPI is no longer a reliable\r\nresource.**\r\n\r\n``pyroxy`` is a special kind of proxy that sits between your client and\r\n`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_; with it, you can restrict what packages\r\nare available, as well as what sources to use.  For example, the default\r\nbehavior is to choose PyPI hosted packages, direct download links, or generic\r\nURLs (which are then parsed), in that order--if the higher precendence is\r\navailable, the more unreliable are omitted.  With the ability to set\r\nwhitelisted packages, this means that you can essentially control what your\r\nclients are accessing at any time!\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be viewed through PyPI, or by building the documentation\r\nyourself using::\r\n\r\n    python setup.py develop\r\n    python setup.py build_sphinx\r\n\r\nThe latest (and previously published) versions of the documentation `are always\r\navailable on RTD <http://readthedocs.org/docs/pyroxy/en/v0.1/>`_.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\npyroxy is covered by the APL 2.0 license.
