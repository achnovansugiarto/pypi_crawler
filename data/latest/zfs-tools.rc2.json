Best used in combination with zsnap as in:\n   \n   - zsnap on the local machine\n   - zreplicate from the local machine to the destination machine\n\n   Obsolete snapshots deleted by zsnap will be automatically purged on\n   the destination machine by zreplicate, as a side effect of using\n   replication streams.  To inhibit this, use the\n   --no-replication-stream option.\n   \n   Run `zreplicate --help` for a compendium of options you may use.\n\n5. zbackup:\n   a command to snapshot and replicate filesystems according to their user properties.\n   This uses zsnap and zreplicate to do the work, which is all driven by properties.\n   For details, see this [further description of zbackup](doc/README-zbackup.md).\n\nThe repository, bug tracker and Web site for this tool is at [http://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools](http://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools).  Comments to me through rudd-o@rudd-o.com.\n\n## Setting up\n\nSetup is rather complicated.  It assumes that you already have ZFS running\nand vaults on both the machine you're going to back up and the machine that\nwill be receiving the backup.\n\n### On the machine to back up\n\n- Install the zfs-shell command   \n  `cp zfs-shell /usr/local/sbin`  \n  `chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell`  \n  `chown root.root /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell`  \n\n- Create a user with a home directory and shell `zfs-shell`  \n  `useradd -rUm -b /var/lib -s /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell zfs`\n\n- Let `sudo` know that the new user can run the zfs command  \n  `zfs ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/zfs`  \n  (ensure you remove the `requiretty` default on `/etc/sudoers`)\n  (check `sudoers.zfs-tools` in `contrib/` for an example)\n\n- Set up a cron job to run `zsnap` as frequently as you want to,\n  snapshotting the dataset you intend to replicate.\n\n### On the backup machine\n\n- Set up public key authentication for SSH so the backup machine\n  may log as the user `zfs` (as laid out above) in the machine to\n  be backed up.\n\n- Create a dataset to receive the backup stream.\n\n- Set up a cron job to fetch the dataset snapshotted by zsnap\n  from the remote machine into the newly created dataset.  You\n  will use `zreplicate` for that (see below for examples).\n\n- After the first replication, you may want to set the `mountpoint`\n  attributes on the received datasets so they do not automount\n  on the backup machine.\n\n### Test\n\nIf all went well, you should be able to do this without issue:\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zfs create receiverpool/senderpool # <--- run this ONLY ONCE\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send the entire senderpool with all snapshots\n    # over from peter to paul, placing it in receiverpool/senderpool\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send an incremental stream of senderpool\n    # into receiverpool/senderpool\n\nAnd that's it, really.",
