This theme turns\nyour ordinary Plone_ site into one suitable for public-facing websites at JPL.\n\n\n.. References:\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n.. _JPL: http://jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThe ``jpl.ngtheme`` package requires:\n\n* Plone 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2\n* Python_ 2.6 or 2.7\n* libxml2_ 2.6.26 or later (*important!*)\n* libxslt_ 1.1.26 or later (*important!*)\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install this theme, just include ``jpl.ngtheme`` as one of your installed\neggs for your Plone site.\n\n* If you're using a buildout_, you can add ``jpl.ngtheme`` to the list of eggs\n  in the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` recipe.  For example::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        jpl.ngtheme\n        ...\n\n* If you're using a \"policy\" project egg, just add ``jpl.ngtheme`` as a\n  dependent egg.\n\n  For example::\n\n    setup(\n        ...\n        install_requires=[\n            ...\n            'jpl.ngtheme',\n            ...\n        ]\n    )\n\nIn either case, re-run the buildout and start your server.\n\nThere's no need to include a \"ZCML slug\", since this package advertises a\n``z3c.autoinclude`` plugin for Plone.  (If you don't know what that means,\nthen don't worry about it.)\n\n\nActivating the Theme\n--------------------\n\nOnce your server is running, you can activate the theme:\n\n1.  Log into your Plone site as a manager.\n2.  Click your name in the personal bar, and click \"Site Setup\".\n3.  Click \"Add-ons\".\n4.  Check the box by ``jpl.ngtheme`` and click \"Activate\".\n\nYou may need to empty your browser cache and reload the page to see the new\ntheme.\n\n\nSetting Up the Webmaster\n------------------------\n\nPublic websites at JPL must tell who their webmasters are in the footer.  With\n``jpl.ngtheme``, this is displayed automatically from the Plone Mail settings.\nTo set this name:\n\n1.  Log into your Plone site as a manager.\n2.  Click your name in the personal bar, and click \"Site Setup\".\n3.  Click \"Mail\".\n4.  Enter the name of the webmaster under \"Site 'From' name\".\n5.  Click \"Save\".\n\n\nChanging the Banner Image\n-------------------------\n\nThe package ``jpl.ngtheme`` includes a generic banner image.  To set a custom\nbanner, create a new image in the PNG_ format; suggested size is 989×127 pixels\n(at 72 pixels per inch).  Save the image into a file, then:\n\n1.  Log into your Plone site as a manager.\n2.  Click your name in the personal bar, and click \"Site Setup\".\n3.  Click \"Zope Management Interface\".\n4.  Click the ``portal_skins`` tool.\n5.  Click the ``jpl_ngtheme_custom_images`` folder.\n6.  Click ``logo.png``.\n7.  Press \"Customize\".\n8.  Across from the \"File Data\" heading, find and upload your new image file.\n\nYou may need to empty your browser cache and reload your site's pages to see\nthe new banner image.\n\n\nQuestions or Comments?\n======================\n\nThe ``jpl.ngtheme`` package was developed by Sean Kelly for the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.  If you have any questions, comments, or would like to report a\nbug or request a new feature, please contact him.\n\n\n\n..

It also adds test layer fixtures as well as\nsome integration tests of the viewlets.\n\n\n1.0.0 — 2011.6.27 — Initial\n---------------------------\n\nThis is the FCS_ of the JPL Next Generation theme.\n\n\n0.0.0dev (unreleased)\n---------------------\n\n* Initial (unreleased) release\n\n\n..
