    "description": "# Overview\n\nqfracture is a Qt based front end exposing a fracture project. The interface\nallows for data browsing and searching as well as data interaction.\n\nFor full details on fracture please see: \n\nhttps://github.com/mikemalinowski/fracture\n\n\n# Browsing\n\nqFracture displays a browsing panel which allows you to navigate data in a \nnatural way - which is particularly useful if your data is file based. \n\n![alt text](https://github.com/mikemalinowski/qfracture/blob/master/docs/qfracture_browse.png?raw=true)\n\nRight clicking a _Data Asset_ exposes the functionality bound to that data. \n\n\n# Searching\n\nWithin qFracture you can perform searches against your dataset. Fracture is \n very quick at resolving searches - so this can be a preferable mechanism\n when interacting with data if you have a reasonable idea of what you're looking\n for. \n \nWhen no search entries are present this view will show any _Data Elements_ which\nyou have marked as being favourites - allowing them to be accessed very quickly\nwith no overhead. \n\n\n# Setting up a Project\n\n\nThe qFracture UI offers a wizard to make it easy to setup a new fracture \nproject. This guides you through the process of defining the data structure \nlocation, the plugin locations and where you want to save your project file.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/mikemalinowski/qfracture/blob/master/docs/qfracture_wizard.png?raw=true)\n\nIt will also initiate a short scan of your data location. Depending on how\nbig your data set this can take a little time. \n\nUpon completion your data set is entirely searchable.\n\n\n## System Tray\n\n\nThe qFracture Ui only performs a deep scan during the first time setup. Beyond\nthat, each location is re-scanned as you traverse those locations through the\nbrowser panel.\n\nIf you want time based scans to occur you can trigger the __System Tray__ \napplication (which is launchable from the _Settings_ tab). The system tray\nallows you to specify an interval time (in seconds), and enable or disable\ntimed scans. \n\nThis approach allows the scanning to occur in a completely different process\nto any qFracture instances which can aid performance, especially if you're \nrunning qFracture from within environments such as Maya or Max etc. \n\n\n# Collaboration\n\nI am always open to collaboration, so if you spot bugs lets me know, or if\nyou would like to contribute or get involved just shout!\n\n\n# Compatibility\n\nLaunchpad has been tested under Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 on Windows and Ubuntu.",
