Smart button displays\n`current points / sum of all points increases this year`.\n\nA new currency is created `PT` (points) and is used by default\nfor `credit_point` field.\n\nOn order confirmation the amount of the order\nis compared with partner's credit:\n\n   a. credit is not enough on partner -> the order cannot be confirmed\n   b. no credit is left on partner\n      but the user is member of `Manage credit point` -> order can be confirmed\n   c. no credit is left on partner\n      but the context has key `skip_credit_check` -> order can be confirmed\n\nIf the order is confirmed the credit is deducted from partner.\n\nHistory of all credit point allocations can be looked up\nin `sales -> configuration -> credit point history`.\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues>`_.
