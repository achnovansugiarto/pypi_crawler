See the file `docs/logging.md` for instructions on how to set it up.\n\nIf no logging option is given, Trello Watchman defaults to Stdout logging.\n\n## Requirements\n### Trello API token\nTo run Trello Watchman, you will need a Trello API OAuth access token, which take the form of a `key` and a `secret`. You can generate these [here](https://trello.com/app-key).\n\n**Note**: User tokens act on behalf of the user who generates them, so I would suggest you create this app and authorise it using a service account, otherwise the app will have access to your private Trello boards.\n\n#### Providing token\nTrello Watchman will first try to get the secret and key from the environment variables `TRELLO_WATCHMAN_SECRET` and `TRELLO_WATCHMAN_KEY`, if this fails it will load the token from .conf file (see below).\n\n### .conf file\nConfiguration options can be passed in a file named `watchman.conf` which must be stored in your home directory. The file should follow the YAML format, and should look like below:\n```yaml\ntrello_watchman:\n  secret: abc123\n  key: abc123\n  logging:\n    file_logging:\n      path: /var/log/\n    json_tcp:\n      host: localhost\n      port: 9020\n```\nTrello Watchman will look for this file at runtime, and use the configuration options from here. If you are not using the advanced logging features, leave them blank.\n\nIf you are having issues with your .conf file, run it through a YAML linter.\n\nAn example file is in `docs/example.conf`\n\n## Installation\nInstall via pip\n\n`python3 -m pip install trello-watchman`\n\n## Usage\nTrello Watchman will be installed as a global command, use as follows:\n```\nusage: trello-watchman [-h] --timeframe {d,w,m,a} [--output {file,stdout,stream}]\n                   [--version] [--all] [--attachments] [--text]\n\nMonitoring your Trello boards for sensitive information\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --version             show program's version number and exit\n  --all                 Find everything\n  --attachments         Search for attachments\n  --text                Search text\n\nrequired arguments:\n  --timeframe {d,w,m,a}\n                        How far back to search: d = 24 hours w = 7 days, m =\n                        30 days, a = all time\n  --output {file,stdout,stream}\n                        Where to send results\n\n  ```\n\nYou can run Trello Watchman to look for everything, and output to default CSV:\n\n`trello-watchman --timeframe a --all`\n\n## Other Watchman apps\nYou may be interested in some of the other apps in the Watchman family:\n- [Slack Watchman](https://github.com/PaperMtn/slack-watchman)\n- [GitLab Watchman](https://github.com/PaperMtn/gitlab-watchman)\n- [GitHub Watchman](https://github.com/PaperMtn/github-watchman)\n\n## License\nThe source code for this project is released under the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL).
