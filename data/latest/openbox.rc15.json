Moreover, we also provide a Web UI,\nthrough which users can easily track and manage the tasks.\n\n\n## Design Goal\n\nThe design of OpenBox follows the following principles:\n+ **Ease of use**: Minimal user effort, and user-friendly visualization for tracking and managing BBO tasks.\n+ **Consistent performance**: Host state-of-the-art optimization algorithms; Choose the proper algorithm automatically.\n+ **Resource-aware management**: Give cost-model-based advice to users, e.g., minimal workers or time-budget.\n+ **Scalability**: Scale to dimensions on the number of input variables, objectives, tasks, trials, and parallel \n  evaluations.\n+ **High efficiency**: Effective use of parallel resources, system optimization with transfer-learning and \n  multi-fidelities, etc.\n+ **Fault tolerance**, **extensibility**, and **data privacy protection**.\n\n## Links\n+ [Documentations](https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | \n

Windows\n\nWe **strongly** suggest you to create a Python environment via \n[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads):\n```bash\nconda create -n openbox python=3.7\nconda activate openbox\n```\n\nThen we recommend you to update your `pip`, `setuptools` and `wheel` as follows:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n```\n\n### Installation from PyPI\n\nTo install OpenBox from PyPI:\n\n```bash\npip install openbox\n```\n\nFor advanced features, [install SWIG](https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/install_swig.html)\nfirst and then run `pip install \"openbox[extra]\"`. \n\n### Manual Installation from Source\n\nTo install the newest OpenBox from the source code, please run the following commands:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box.git && cd open-box\npip install .\n```\n\nAlso, for advanced features, [install SWIG](https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/install_swig.html)\nfirst and then run `pip install \".[extra]\"`.\n\nFor more details about installation instructions, please refer to the \n[Installation Guide](https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/installation_guide.html).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nA quick start example is given by:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom openbox import Optimizer, space as sp\n\n# Define Search Space\nspace = sp.Space()\nx1 = sp.Real(\"x1\", -5, 10, default_value=0)\nx2 = sp.Real(\"x2\", 0, 15, default_value=0)\nspace.add_variables([x1, x2])\n\n# Define Objective Function\ndef branin(config):\n    x1, x2 = config['x1'], config['x2']\n    y = (x2-5.1/(4*np.pi**2)*x1**2+5/np.pi*x1-6)**2+10*(1-1/(8*np.pi))*np.cos(x1)+10\n    return {'objectives': [y]}\n\n# Run\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    opt = Optimizer(branin, space, max_runs=50, task_id='quick_start')\n    history = opt.run()\n    print(history)\n```\n\nThe example with multi-objectives and constraints is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom openbox import Optimizer, space as sp\n\n# Define Search Space\nspace = sp.Space()\nx1 = sp.Real(\"x1\", 0.1, 10.0)\nx2 = sp.Real(\"x2\", 0.0, 5.0)\nspace.add_variables([x1, x2])\n\n# Define Objective Function\ndef CONSTR(config):\n    x1, x2 = config['x1'], config['x2']\n    y1, y2 = x1, (1.0 + x2) / x1\n    c1, c2 = 6.0 - 9.0 * x1 - x2, 1.0 - 9.0 * x1 + x2\n    return dict(objectives=[y1, y2], constraints=[c1, c2])\n\n# Run\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    opt = Optimizer(CONSTR, space, num_objectives=2, num_constraints=2,\n                    max_runs=50, ref_point=[10.0, 10.0], task_id='moc')\n    history = opt.run()\n    history.plot_pareto_front()  # plot for 2 or 3 objectives\n    plt.show()\n```\n\nWe also provide **HTML Visualization**. Enable it by setting additional options\n`visualization`=`basic`/`advanced` and `auto_open_html=True`(optional) in `Optimizer`:\n\n```python\nopt = Optimizer(...,\n    visualization='advanced',  # or 'basic'. For 'advanced', run 'pip install \"openbox[extra]\"' first\n    auto_open_html=True,       # open the visualization page in your browser automatically\n)\nhistory = opt.run()\n```\n\nFor more visualization details, please refer to \n[HTML Visualization](https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visualization/visualization.html).\n\n**More Examples**:\n+ [Single-Objective with Constraints](\n  https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/optimize_problem_with_constraint.py)\n+ [Multi-Objective](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/optimize_multi_objective.py)\n+ [Multi-Objective with Constraints](\n  https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/optimize_multi_objective_with_constraint.py)\n+ [Ask-and-tell Interface](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/ask_and_tell_interface.py)\n+ [Parallel Evaluation on Local](\n  https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/evaluate_async_parallel_optimization.py)\n+ [Distributed Evaluation](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/distributed_optimization.py)\n+ [Tuning LightGBM](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/tuning_lightgbm.py)\n+ [Tuning XGBoost](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box/blob/master/examples/tuning_xgboost.py)\n\n## **Enterprise Users**\n<img src=\"docs/imgs/logo_tencent.png\" width=\"35%\" class=\"align-left\" alt=\"Tencent Logo\">\n\n* [Tencent Inc.](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)\n\n<img src=\"docs/imgs/logo_alibaba.png\" width=\"35%\" class=\"align-left\" alt=\"Alibaba Logo\">\n\n* [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/)\n\n<img src=\"docs/imgs/logo_kuaishou.png\" width=\"35%\" class=\"align-left\" alt=\"Kuaishou Logo\">\n\n* [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/en)\n\n\n## **Contributing**\nOpenBox has a frequent release cycle.
