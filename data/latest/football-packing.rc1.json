    "description": "Football Packing\n\n[![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-red.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)\n\nThis is a python package to calculate packing rate for a given [pass](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(association_football)>)\nin soccer.\nThis is a variation of the metric created by [Impect](https://www.impect.com/).\n\nOne of the main variation of this metric from other traditional ones is that only the defending players\nwho are in the scope of the pass are considered for packing and not all the defenders on the pitch.\nThe other difference would be the fact that for defenders, their lines on the pitch are considered with respect to the pass direction. Sample Scenarios section on the doc has more details\nabout these differences.\n\nIf a defender's line is cut by a pass, they're considered to be packed (+1 for that defender)\neven if the defender is not near the line of pass (pass is on one\nside of the pitch and defender is far away).So if an attacking player makes a long pass beyond the entire defense,\nthen all the defenders would be considered as packed (+1), but in truth only few of the players would be near the\nline of pass and could have an impact on the outcome of the pass/play.\n\nAlso for different types of passes (forward, back & side) packing is still calculated but a constant is\nmultiplied with the packing value based on the type of pass.\n\n- For a back pass, multiplying factor is `-1`.\n- For a side pass, multiplying factor is `0.5`.\n- For a forward pass, multiplying factor is `1`.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe concept of packing belongs to [Impect](https://www.impect.com/) and I do not take credit for the metric.\n\nThis is an attempt to create an open source variation of it, with few modifications on how the metrics are calculated. The logic behind the metric calculations are explained in `How packing is calculated` section in the docs.\n\nFor any questions/feedback, reach out to me on twitter [@SamiraK93](https://twitter.com/Samirak93).\n\nIf you'd like to file any issues/updates, submit a PR on GitHub.",
