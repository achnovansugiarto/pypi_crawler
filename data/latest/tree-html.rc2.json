    "description": "# Tree HTML\n\nTree HTML renders an interactive directory structure in html from a local path on disk. \nIt can be run as a standalone python tool or it can be fed JSON output produced by running `tree` separately somewhere else.\nThis tool was built on top of the [CodyHouse](https://github.com/CodyHouse/multi-level-accordion-menu) HTML/CSS codebase \nfor displaying files and directories neatly.\n\nSee the example output from running `tree-html` on this repo:\n\n![screenshot](tree-html-screenshot.png)\n\n## General usage\n\nIn the most common case, `tree-html` can be run as a standalone tool on the current working directory as follows:\n```\ntree-html \n```\n\nA second use case involves supplying `tree-html` with the output json file obtained from running `tree -J` separately. \nThis may be useful, for example, in cases where you are working on a different file system to the target path. \nThis can be achieved by using the `-i` flag; for example:\n```\ntree-html -i output-file-from-tree.json\n```\n\nThe default output from `tree-html` is a directory named `tree-html/` which is generated in the current working directory. \nThis directory contains a file called `index.html`, which can be opened in any browser for display. \nNote that this directory also contains some static assets that should always accompany the html file if the folder is to \nbe moved or shared.\n\n## Usage options\n\nTo execute the tool from a location other than the current working directory:\n```\ntree-html /path/to/different/cool-location\n```\n\nIn the above case, it also might be desirable to specify a different top-level directory name to use in the output, \nrather than the full path. This can be achieved as follows:\n```\ntree-html /path/to/different/cool-location -n cooler-location\n```\n\nTo limit the output to only contain a given depth below the top-level directory, the `-l` flag can be used:\n```\ntree -l 3  # limits the output to three levels below the parent and ignores anything deeper\n```\n\nAdditional options may be supplied to customise the content and styling of the output file, such as using custom headings, \ntext descriptions, different colored themes and url links. Run `tree-html --help` for the complete set of available options.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using pip:\n```\npip install tree-html\n```\n\nOr if you prefer to use pipenv to automatically install `tree-html` into a new isolated virtual environment:\n```\npipenv install .\n```\n\nIf you wish to develop this tool further then you should also install the development dependencies:\n```\npipenv install --dev\n```\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please either create a new branch or fork this repo and then submit a pull request.\nAll contributions are welcome.\n\n\n",
