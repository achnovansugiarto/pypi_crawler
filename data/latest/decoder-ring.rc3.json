    "description": "# Decoder_Ring\n\n`pip install decoder-ring`\n\n`from decoder_ring import ContrastiveSearch`\n\n## Concept\n\nThe fluency and usefulness of text generation models depends on the decoder used to select tokens from probabilities and build the text output.\n\nTwo examples: greedy decoding always selects the most probable token; random sampling considers all possible tokens with their given probability.\n\nThe goal of decoder_ring is a common API with type hints, helpful error messages and logs, parameter restrictions, encouragement of random seeds, etc. to make text decoding clear and reproducible. In the future this should support many more decoder types.\n\n## Documentation\n\nI would like to expand on the documentation in all of the decoder options, links to relevant papers etc., to make this library and the overall decoder concept accessible to new users.\n\n### Supported methods\n\n- ContrastiveSearch (params: random_seed, penalty_alpha, top_k)\n- GreedyDecoder\n- RandomSampling (params: random_seed)\n- TypicalDecoder (params: random_seed, typical_p)\n\n### Writer Examples (text input and output)\n\n```python\nfrom decoder import BasicWriter, RandomSampling\n\nbasic = BasicWriter('gpt2', RandomSampling)\nwriter_output = basic.write_text(\n    prompt=\"Hello, my name is\", max_length=20, early_stopping=True\n)\n```\n\n### Decoder Examples (with customization)\n\nStart with a HuggingFace Transformers / PyTorch model and tokenized text:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ncontent = tokenizer.encode(\"Hello, my name is\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n```\n\nExample with Transformers' default greedy decoder:\n\n```python\ndecoder1 = GreedyDecoder(model)\ngreedy_output = decoder1.generate_text(\n    prompt=content, max_length=20, early_stopping=True\n)\ntokenizer.decode(greedy_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n```\n\nExample with typical decoding, which will require a `random_seed` before generating text, and a `typical_p` between 0 and 1:\n\n```python\ndecoder3 = TypicalDecoder(model, random_seed=603, typical_p=0.4)\ntypical_output = decoder3.generate_text(\n    prompt=content, max_length=20, early_stopping=True\n)\n\n# new random seed\ndecoder3.set_random_seed(101)\ntypical_output_2 = decoder3.generate_text(\n    prompt=content, max_length=20, early_stopping=True\n)\n```\n\n## License\n\nApache license for compatibility with the Transformers library\n",
