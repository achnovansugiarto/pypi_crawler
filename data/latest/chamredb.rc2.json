Multiple databases exist with comparative strengths and weaknesses. This project builds on the concepts of the [haAMRonization](https://github.com/pha4ge/hAMRonization) project aiming to aggeregate and combine the information contained within the metadata associated with each project. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the equivalent antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) can be named differently in each database.\n\nThe hypothesis for the project is as follows:  \n\n* given a match in one database\n* find the matches in other databases\n* aggregate the combined descriptive information pertaining to antimicrobial resistance contained in the union of the metadata\n* report this to user for them to make intelligent informed choices\n\n## Methodology\n\n* Download sequences and associated metadata of ARGs from 3 databases\n  * [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) ([Manuscript](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665441))\n  * [NCBI AMR Reference Gene Catalog](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/)\n  * [Resfinder 4](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/resfinder/src/4.0/) ([Manuscipt](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/12/3491/5890997))  \n   Details can be found in the [appendices](/docs/appendices.md#data-download)\n* Parse the data to\n  * extract the protein sequences and write into fasta format with the gene identifiers as the record ids.\n  * extract the associated metadata and convert to a consistent `JSON` format  \n   Details can be found in the [appendices](/docs/appendices.md#data-parsing)\n* Find best matches of each gene from one source database against the other two target databases\n  * Where a reciprocal best hit (RBH) exists, report this.  \n     Details can be found in the [appendices](/docs/appendices.md#analyse-for-reciprocal-best-hits-rbhs).  \n     A summary of the results can be found [here](/docs/appendices.md#summary-of-rbh-analysis)\n  * If a RBH does not exist, report the best match as long as thresholds for coverage and indentity are met.\n    A summary of the results can be found [here](/docs/appendices.md#summary-of-non-rbh-searches)\n  \n  For this purpose the [MMseqs2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29035372/) search tool was used that in its most sensitive mode is 100x faster than blastp and almost as sensitive. In a [comparative manuscript](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33099302/) demonstrated that even in the worst cases MMseqs2 would not miss more than 10% of the RBH produced by blastp. MMseqs2 also contains a convenient wrapper to perform the all-by-all search necessary to find RBHs.\n\n* From the outputs of the MMseqs2 searches the RBHs or best matches of each gene from one database against the other two databases can be parsed to produce a `Directed Graph`. This network was constructed using the [networkx](https://networkx.org/) python package.  \n  Details of the method can be found [here](docs/appendices.md#building-a-networkx-graph)  \n  In this graph\n  * the nodes represent a protein from one database\n    * Node attributes contain the phenotype from the JSON metadata\n  * the edges link nodes and represent the matches and attributes include\n    * type, either RBH or OWH (one way hit)\n    * coverage, (alignment length/query length)\n    * identity, (percent identity of match)  \n  See the image below for a pictoral example using made up data  \n\n\n\\\n\\\n![network diagram](docs/images/chamredb_network.png)\n\n## Assessing the graph\n\nIn order to look at the 19132 matches within the database and assess the effectiveness of the methodology the database names for matches were compared with the [Normalized Levensthein algorithm](https://devopedia.org/levenshtein-distance#qst-ans-3).\nBefore calculating the name similarity between the source and target of a match the name was cleaned using the following steps\n\n1. Removing species names from database names (exclusively in the CARD database) e.g `Staphylococcus aureus mupB conferring resistance to mupirocin`\n2. Coversion to lower case\n3. Removing the bla prefix\n4. Removing parentheses\n5. Removing hyphens\n\n_N.B blaPAO-N and blaPDC matches are the source of 562 low name similarities so were skipped_\n\nThe resulting data is plotted below showing\nA: distribution of levenshtein smilarities between the database names of the best matches\nB: distribution sequence identities for the best matches\nC: plot of the levenshtein smilarity versus the sequence identity for each match  \n\n![analysis plots](scripts/seq_id_and_name_sim_analysis.png)  \n\nThe red line shows the correlation including 95% confidence intervals.\n\nBased on this regression the expected name similarity for a sequence identity of 0.95 can be calculated (0.69)\n\n```\nlinear_fit = np.polyfit(\n    distance_dataframe['sequence_identity'],\n    distance_dataframe['name_similarity'],\n    1\n)\nnp.polyval(linear_fit, 0.95)\n0.6898250936869554\n```\nTo examine data matches where the sequence identity is > 0.95 **BUT** the name similarity is less than the predicted 0.69 was created and explored, a [CSV file](scripts/low_name_similarity.csv) was created.\n\nIn this data, many of the differences in the names are due to matches with the same gene family but different alleles e.g `blaADC-125` in the `ncbi` database and `blaADC-25` in the `resfinder 4` database.  \nTherefore data calculating name smilarities ignoring alleles was created.\n\n\nA second series of plots explores this data by plotting the distributions of the name smilarities.\nIn the top panel the violin plots show the distribution of the name similarity differences for those matches where the sequence identity is greater than 0.95. In A: this name similarities are based on complete cleaned locus names and in B: they are based on names where the alleles are ignored. \nThe lower panel of the figure contains violin plots showing the distribution of the **difference** between the **observed name similarity** and that **predicted** by a linear regression model fitting name smilarity to sequence identity. The right hand 2 plots are data where the name simialrities were calculated excluding alleles.\n![analysis plots](scripts/name_similarity_distribution_analysis.png)\n\nThe data was filtered for those matches where the sequence identity is > 0.95 but the name similarity is less than the predicted value of 0.86 based on the linear regression model. \n\nTo examine these anomalous results a [CSV sheet](scripts/low_name_similarity_without_alleles.csv) was created.  \n\nExploring this data some of these are clearly related genes but the databases have different nomneclature e.g  \n`vanA` in `card` and `VanHAX` in `resfinder 4.0` or  \n`catA15` in `ncbi` or `Clostridium butyricum catB` in `card`\n\n_**N.B** The species names are removed in the name cleaning function._  \n\nIn other cases the names are completely different, e.g  \n`gimA` in `card` and `mgt`  in `ncbi` but the sequences are 99.5% identical. `gimA` is a macrolide glycosyltransferase and may confer resistance to spiramycin. `mgt` in the `ncbi` database stands for `macrolide-inactivating glycosyltransferase`. Clearly the genes are likely to have the same function but have been assigned different names in the two databases.\n\n## Querying the graph\n\n```\nusage: chamredb query\n  [-h]\n  [-d {card,ncbi,resfinder}]\n  [-ct COVERAGE_THRESHOLD] [-it IDENTITY_THRESHOLD]\n  (-i ID | -f ID_FILE | -j HAMRONIZATION_JSON_FILE)\n  [-o OUTFILE_PATH]\n```\n\nThe graph can be queried in one of 3 ways  \n\n### 1. Querying an individual\n\nRequires specifying the identifier `-i` and database `-d`  \n\n```\nchamredb query -d ncbi -i WP_012695489.1 \n```\n\nAlternatively the gene name can be used\n\n```\nchamredb query -d ncbi -i qnrB2\n```\n\nThe output reports the matches and metadata from the other databases  \n![qnrB2](/docs/images/qnrB2.png)\n\nAnother example where the matches are one way hits not RBHs\n\n```\nchamredb query -d resfinder -i \"aac(3)-IIIb\"\n```\n\n![aac(3)-IIIb](/docs/images/aac(3)-IIIb.png)\nIn these outputs ↔ means a RBH, and ➡ a search hit\n\n### 2. Providing a list of identifiers from a single database\n\nRequires specifying the database `-d`, the text file containing the ids `-f`, and a path for the tsv output file `-o`  \n\n```\nchamredb query -d card -f docs/data/card_ids.txt  -o docs/data/card_ids.tsv\n```\n\nThis will produce a [TSV file](/docs/data/card_ids.tsv) containing the matches and associated metadata with one row per id in the text file\n\n### 3. Use hAMRonization summary output\n\nUse the [hAMRonization softare](https://github.com/pha4ge/hAMRonization) to convert the outputs from antimicrobial resistance gene detection tools into a unified format. Concatenate and summarize AMR detection reports into a single summary JSON file using the `hamronize summarize` command from this package. The JSON output from this step can be used to query ChamreDb.  \nUse `-j` to specify the json summary file and `-o` the path for the TSV output  \n**Please Note**  \nOnly outputs using data derived from AMR detection tools that have searched either the `CARD`, `NCBI` or `Resfinder 4` databases can be used.\n\n```\nchamredb query -j docs/data/hamronize_summary.json -o docs/data/hamronize_summary.tsv\n```\n\nThis will produce a [TSV file](/docs/data/hamronize_summary.tsv) containing the matches and associated metadata with one row per id in the text file\n\n\n",
