    "description": "# Welcome to LUCI\nIn this document, you will find a brief description of what `LUCI` is, how to install it (her), where to go to find examples, documentation, and more!\n\n## What is LUCI\n`LUCI` is a general purpose fitting pipeline built specifically with [SITELLE IFU](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Sitelle/)\ndata cubes in mind; however, if you need to fit any emission line spectra, LUCI\nwill be able to help! Although other codees exist, we built `LUCI` specifically with the user\nin mind. Thanks to the clear coding practices used in creating `LUCI` and her detailed documentation,\nusers can modify the code easily by changing numerical solvers. Additionally, we implemented\na Bayesian Inference algorithm using MCMC (using `emcee`) to derive uncertainty estimates.\n\n## Installing `LUCI`\nWe have tried to make the installation of `LUCI` as smooth and painless as possible; however, if you have suggestions, please reach out to us.\nBelow are our instructions for installing on a linux/MacOS-based distribution.\n\n1. **Clone** this repository . I suggest cloning it in Documents or Applications.\n    ```git clone https://github.com/crhea93/LUCI.git```\n2. **Enter repository** wherever you cloned it.\n    ```cd LUCI```\n3. **Create** luci environment using the following command: `conda env create -f luci.yml`. Now, whenever you wish to use `LUCI`, you can load the environment by simply typing the following into your terminal: `conda activate luci`.  \n\nNow you are all set to use Luci! To load the module into a python file or jupyter notebook simply add the following lines:\n```\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, '/the/path/to/LUCI/')\nimport Luci\n```\n\n\n## What to use `LUCI` for\n`LUCI` is, of course, first and foremost a fitting algorithm. In order to ease the pain of fitting IFU data cubes, we have built several wrappers for the fitting functions (these can be found in **Luci/LuciFit.py**). These functionalities include, but are not limited to, reading in a data cube in the HDF5 format (`LUCI()`), fitting the entire data cube (`LUCI.fit_entire_cube`), fitting a region or masked region of the cube (`LUCI.fit_region()`), extracting and fitting an integrated region (`LUCI.fit_spectrum_region`, creating a *deep image* (`LUCI.create_deep_image`), and building a Signal-to-Noise ratio map of the cube (`LUCI.create_snr_map`).\n\nYou can also access the fitting directly by circumventing the `LUCI` wrappers and directly accesing the fitting algorithms (`Luci.LuciFitting`). With this, you can fit any spectrum using the `Luci.LuciFitting.fit` and `Luci.LuciFitting.bayes_fit` algorithms. We also provide basic plotting functionality which can be found in `Luci.LuciPlotting`.\n\n### Where to find examples\nExamples are paramount to the success of any open source code. Therefore, we have tried to make our examples as complete as possible. That said, we surely have forgotten something! If you wish to see an example that does not exist (or for an example to be better explained), please shoot us an email or open up an issue!\n\nAll examples can be found in two locations. Read-through examples can be found on our [read the docs (https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/index.html)](https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/index.html) page while jupyter notebooks can be found in the **Examples** folder.\nI suggest starting with [https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/example_basic_lite.html](https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/example_basic_lite.html).\n\n### Where to find documentation\nDocumentation can also be found on our [read the docs (https://luci-fitting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)](https://luci-fitting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page. In addition to documentation on each function in `LUCI`, you can also find a description of what `LUCI` calculates and how she does what she does!\n\n\n## Contributing\nIf you wish to contribute, that's awesome! Please shoot me an email at [carter.rhea@umontreal.ca](mailto:carter.rhea@umontreal.ca).\nThe easiest way to get involved is to make an issue or fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a well-documented pull request.\n\n## Contact\nIf you have any questions about how to install, use, or modify `LUCI`, please send an email to [Carter Rhea](mailto:carter.rhea@umontreal.ca).\n\n## Copyright & License\n2021 Carter Rhea ([carter.rhea@umontreal.ca](mailto:carter.rhea@umontreal.ca))\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
