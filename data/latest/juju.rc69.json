    "description": "A Python library for Juju\n=========================\n\nSource code: https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju\n\nBug reports: https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/issues\n\nDocumentation: https://pythonlibjuju.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Python 3.8/3.9/3.10\n* Tested using Juju 3.1.0\n\n\nDesign Notes\n------------\n\n* Asynchronous - Uses asyncio and async/await features of Python\n* Websocket-level bindings are programmatically generated (indirectly) from the\n  Juju golang code, ensuring full api coverage\n* Provides an OO layer which encapsulates much of the websocket api and\n  provides familiar nouns and verbs (e.g. Model.deploy(), Application.add_unit(),\n  etc.)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  pip3 install juju\n\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nHere's a simple example that shows basic usage of the library. The example\nconnects to the currently active Juju model, deploys a single unit of the\nubuntu charm, then exits:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  #!/usr/bin/python3\n\n  import logging\n  import sys\n\n  from juju import jasyncio\n  from juju.model import Model\n\n\n  async def deploy():\n      # Create a Model instance. We need to connect our Model to a Juju api\n      # server before we can use it.\n      model = Model()\n\n      # Connect to the currently active Juju model\n      await model.connect_current()\n\n      try:\n          # Deploy a single unit of the ubuntu charm, using the latest revision\n          # from the stable channel of the Charm Store.\n          ubuntu_app = await model.deploy(\n            'ubuntu',\n            application_name='ubuntu',\n            series='xenial',\n            channel='stable',\n          )\n\n          if '--wait' in sys.argv:\n              # optionally block until the application is ready\n              await model.block_until(lambda: ubuntu_app.status == 'active')\n      finally:\n          # Disconnect from the api server and cleanup.\n          await model.disconnect()\n\n\n  def main():\n      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n      # If you want to see everything sent over the wire, set this to DEBUG.\n      ws_logger = logging.getLogger('websockets.protocol')\n      ws_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n      # Run the deploy coroutine in an asyncio event loop, using a helper\n      # that abstracts loop creation and teardown.\n      jasyncio.run(deploy())\n\n\n  if __name__ == '__main__':\n      main()\n\n\nMore examples can be found in the docs, as well as in the ``examples/``\ndirectory of the source tree which can be run using ``tox``.  For\nexample, to run ``examples/connect_current_model.py``, use:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  tox -e example -- examples/connect_current_model.py\n\n\nREPL\n^^^^\n\nTo experiment with the library in a REPL, launch python in asyncio mode\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  $ python3 -m asyncio\n\nand then, to connect to the current model and fetch status:\n\n.. code::\n\n  >>> from juju.model import Model\n  >>> model = Model()\n  >>> await model.connect_current()\n  >>> status = await model.get_status()\n\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nPylibjuju releases now track the Juju release cadence. New generated schemas\nwill be updated per Juju releases.\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n3.1.0.1\n^^^^^^^\n\nFriday 10th February 2023\n\nThis release targets juju version 3.1.0 and enables the new secrets backend api.\nConnectivity with juju controllers in the 3.x series is allowed, connections with different major version controllers (e.g. 2.x, 4.x, etc.) will be cancelled.\n\nThis version is only tested using Juju 3.1.0.\n\n## What's Changed\n* setup.py: adjust websockets versions for py38-310 by @mert-kirpici in https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/pull/731\n* [JUJU-2175] Remove juju
