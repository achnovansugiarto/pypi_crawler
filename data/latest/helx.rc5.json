It allows to easily switch between different RL libraries, and to easily test your agents on different environments.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/epignatelli/helx\n```\n\nIf you also want to download the binaries for `mujoco`, both `gym` and `dm_control`, and `atari`:\n```bash\nhelx-download-extras\n```\n\nAnd then tell the system where the mujoco binaries are:\n```bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/mujoco/lib\nexport MJLIB_PATH=/path/to/home/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin/libmujoco210.so\nexport MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH=/path/to/home/.mujoco/mujoco210\n```\n\n---\n## Example\n\nA typical use case is to design an agent, and toy-test it on `catch` before evaluating it on more complex environments, such as atari, procgen or mujoco.\n\n```python\nimport bsuite\nimport gym\n\nimport helx.environment\nimport helx.experiment\nimport helx.agents\n\n# create the enviornment in you favourite way\nenv = bsuite.load_from_id(\"catch/0\")\n# convert it to an helx environment\nenv = helx.environment.to_helx(env)\n# create the agent\nhparams = helx.agents.Hparams(env.obs_space(), env.action_space())\nagent = helx.agents.Random(hparams)\n\n# run the experiment\nhelx.experiment.run(env, agent, episodes=100)\n```\n\n\nSwitching to a different environment is as simple as changing the `env` variable.\n\n\n```diff\nimport bsuite\nimport gym\n\nimport helx.environment\nimport helx.experiment\nimport helx.agents\n\n# create the enviornment in you favourite way\n-env = bsuite.load_from_id(\"catch/0\")\n+env = gym.make(\"procgen:procgen-coinrun-v0\")\n# convert it to an helx environment\nenv = helx.environment.to_helx(env)\n# create the agent\nhparams = helx.agents.Hparams(env.obs_space(), env.action_space())\nagent = helx.agents.Random(hparams)\n\n# run the experiment\nhelx.experiment.run(env, agent, episodes=100)\n```\n\n---\n## Supported libraries\n\nWe currently support these external environment models:\n- [dm_env](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env)\n- [bsuite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)\n- [dm_control](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control), including\n  - [Mujoco](https://mujoco.org)\n- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and [gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), including\n  - The [minigrid]() family\n  - The [minihack]() family\n  - The [atari](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) family\n  - The legacy [mujoco](https://www.roboti.us/download.html) family\n  - And the standard gym family\n- [gym3](https://github.com/openai/gym3), including\n  - [procgen](https://github.com/openai/procgen)\n\n#### On the road:\n- [gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax)\n- [ivy_gym](https://github.com/unifyai/gym)\n---\n## Adding a new agent (`helx.agents.Agent`)\n\nAn `helx` agent interface is designed as the minimal set of functions necessary to *(i)* interact with an environment and *(ii)* reinforcement learn.\n\n```python\nclass Agent(ABC):\n    \"\"\"A minimal RL agent interface.\"\"\"\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def sample_action(self, timestep: Timestep) -> Action:\n        \"\"\"Applies the agent's policy to the current timestep to sample an action.\"\"\"\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def update(self, timestep: Timestep) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"Updates the agent's internal state (knowledge), such as a table,\n        or some function parameters, e.g., the parameters of a neural network.\"\"\"\n```\n\n---\n## Adding a new environment library (`helx.environment.Environment`)\n\nTo add a new library requires three steps:\n1. Implement the `helx.environment.Environment` interface for the new library.\nSee the [dm_env](helx/environment/dm_env.py) implementation for an example.\n1. Implement serialisation (to `helx`) of the following objects:\n    - `helx.environment.Timestep`\n    - `helx.spaces.Discrete`\n    - `helx.spaces.Continuous`\n2. Add the new library to the [`helx.environment.to_helx`](helx/environment/interop.py#L16) function to tell `helx` about the new protocol.\n\n---\n## Cite\nIf you use `helx` please consider citing it as:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{helx,\n  author = {Pignatelli, Eduardo},\n  title = {Helx: Interoperating between Reinforcement Learning Experimental Protocols},\n  year = {2021},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/epignatelli/helx}}\n  }\n```\n\n---\n## A note on maintainance\nThis repository was born as the recipient of personal research code that was developed over the years.\nIts maintainance is limited by the time and the resources of a research project resourced with a single person.\nEven if I would like to automate many actions, I do not have the time to maintain the whole body of automation that a well maintained package deserves.\nThis is the reason of the WIP badge, which I do not plan to remove soon.\nMaintainance will prioritise the code functionality over documentation and automation.\n\nAny help is very welcome.\nA quick guide to interacting with this repository:\n- If you find a bug, please open an issue, and I will fix it as soon as I can.\n- If you want to request a new feature, please open an issue, and I will consider it as soon as I can.\n- If you want to contribute yourself, please open an issue first, let's discuss objective, plan a proposal, and open a pull request to act on it.\n\nIf you would like to be involved further in the development of this repository, please contact me directly at: `edu dot pignatelli at gmail dot com`.\n",
