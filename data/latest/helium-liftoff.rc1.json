    "description": "# Liftoff\nLiftoff is a set of command line tools for creating local development projects and resources.\n\n## Pre-Release\nLiftoff is currently in pre-release, and does not include any official support. Use this tool with caution, and report\nany error messages or bugs to [developers@heliumservices.com](mailto:developers@heliumservices.com).\n\n## How it Works\nUnder the hood, liftoff uses a selection of docker containers to run all of the services necessary to power your web\napplication locally. Before using liftoff, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.\n\nLiftoff includes the following service containers:\n- PostgreSQL (database)\n- MySQL (database)\n- Adminer (web-based database client tool)\n- Mailhog (fake smtp server for local email testing, includes web-based inbox)\n- PHP 7.4 (interpreter for NGINX)\n- PHP 8.0 (interpreter for NGINX)\n- NGINX (local web server)\n\nThese containers are shared between all of your local development projects, rather than creating new instances for each\nnew project. For each project that you configure with liftoff, liftoff creates a `.liftoff` directory which includes \nall of the configuration files necessary to serve your project in the shared containers.\n\nNote that the `.liftoff` configuration directory should be included in your project source control, while select files\nin that directory will be automatically added to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n## Usage\n### Liftoff Services\nTo start liftoff services:\n```\nliftoff start\n```\n\nTo stop liftoff services:\n```\nliftoff stop\n```\n\nTo restart liftoff services:\n```\nliftoff restart\n```\n\n### Configuring a New Liftoff Project\nTo configure liftoff for a new project:\n```\ncd /your/project/directory\nliftoff init\n```\n\nThen follow the question prompts to configure your project.\n\nNote that any questions that display numbered multiple choice options, you must enter the number of your answer, not the\ntext.\n\n### Configuring an Existing Liftoff Project\nFor projects which have been previously initialized with Liftoff, but need to be configured for your system:\n```\ncd /your/project/directory\nliftoff build\n```\n\nThis is for projects which have an existing `.liftoff` configuration directory, but are new to your system, such as\nprojects which were configured on another developer's system, and you are now cloning the project on your own system.\n\nAlternatively, if you have already configured a project with liftoff, but you relocate the project directory on your\nsystem, you should run this command.\n\n",
