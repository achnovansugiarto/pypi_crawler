    "description": "# Integra Blockchain Authenticated Smart Document Package\n\nThis package will allow the generation of Integra blockchain authenticated smart documents. The package was developed by Integra for making the generations of smart documents from DocAssemble easy and allow customizable metadata to be stored in these smart documents. The file that is created will have the hash of the document registered on the Integra blockchain and will also embed a QR code for authenticity purposes.\n\nThis package provides a function **generate()** which returns an Integra authenticated smart document from a the pdf file created by the interview and will also embed the metadata passed into the function within the pdf before the document is hashed and registered on the Integra blockchain.\n\nFor more information about Integra's blockchain authenticated smart documents please visit [Integra's Homepage](https://www.integraledger.com)\n\n### - Function Definition\n\n_generate(file_url, meta_data)_\n\n> file_url - the name or variable of the file created from the interview\n> meta_data - JSON representation of the fields to be embedded as metadata within the document. These field values are variables from the interview\n\n### - Example Interviews\n\n[Example Interview #1 - using attachment specifier](http://integra.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/interview?i=docassemble.playground1%3Anative_docassemble.yml)\n\n[Example Interview #2 - allowing user to upload PDF](http://integra.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/interview?i=docassemble.playground1%3Asmartdocment.yml)\n\n[Example Interview #3 - advanced interview](http://integra.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/interview?i=docassemble.playground1%3Aadvanced.yml)\n\n### - Function Usage Example - Basic\n\n```python\ngenerate(file, {\n  \"name\": name,\n  \"color\": color,\n  \"band\": band\n})\n```\n\n### - Function Usage Example - Advanced\n\n```python\ngenerate(demand_letter.pdf, {\n    \"client_name\": client.name.full(),\n    \"client_address\": client.address.on_one_line(),\n    \"opposing_party_name\": opposing_party.name.text,\n    \"opposing_party_address\": opposing_party.address.on_one_line(),\n    \"act_date\": act_date.format(),\n    \"act_description\": act_description,\n    \"act_harm\": act_harm,\n    \"act_cost\": currency(act_cost)\n})\n```\n\n## Source Code\n\n### - Example Interview #1 - using attachment specifier\n\n```yaml\nmodules:\n  - SmartDocument\n---\nmandatory: true\nquestion: Step 1\nsubquestion: |\n  Would you like to learn more about the Docassemble Integra blockchain authenticated smart documents?\nbuttons:\n  - Yes: continue\n  - No: exit\n---\nmandatory: true\nquestion: Step 2\nsubquestion: |\n  An Integra blockchain authenticated smart document stores the metadata created from this interview within the PDF and registers a hash of the document on the Integra blockchain.

Once it has been verified as authentic, the meta data contained within the document will become computable and used by an existing system to injest the information contained within the document into the system.  \n      This is a quick example of document automation.

Create a document \"from scratch\" using Docassemble's formatting commands\n  2. Fill in a PDF template using form fields added with Adobe Acrobat\n  3. Fill in a Word Docx template using mail-merge fields (uncommon)\n  4. Fill in a Word Docx template using Docassemble's special formatting tags.\n  For simplicity this interview will only demonstrate the 1st method. There is\n  slightly different syntax for the other options, but they offer you the ability\n  to automate highly formatted documents in comparison to the demonstrated\n  feature.\n  This interview includes a brief example of the use of the Individual and Address \n  objects and Google Maps geocoding. It also incidentally introduces signatures,\n  the currency() function, and the show if question modifier.\n---\nmetadata:\n  title: |\n    Consumer Protection Demand Letter\n---\ncomment: |\n  The modules block allows you to include optional Docassemble features.\n  see: https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#modules\nmodules:\n  - docassemble.base.util\n  - SmartDocument\n---\ncomment: |\n  The objects block allows you to make use of object-oriented classes. This is a very powerful feature\n  but you can get by with just a little understanding of it.\n  See: https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html and https://www.nonprofittechy.com/2018/09/12/object-oriented-programming-for-document-assembly-developers/\nobjects:\n  - client: Individual # Creates a new variable named client, which is an instance of an Individual object\n  - opposing_party: Person # A Person represents a legal person, which might be a company rather than an individual\n---\ncomment: |\n  It's a good idea, but not required, to control the order of questions in your interview\n  with a single mandatory code block like this one.\n  Just list the variables that you want Docassemble to find, in order. If a screen defines more than\n  one variable you only need to list one variable from that screen.\n  See: https://docassemble.org/docs/logic.html#order\n  You can also include Python code here but usually should only use \"if\" statements that control interview flow.\n  See: https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-workinggroup/blob/master/Skillshares/2.%20adding%20in%20logic/basic_logic.md\nmandatory: True\ncode: |\n  intro_screen\n  client.name.first\n  opposing_party.name.text\n  op_business\n  if not op_doing_business:\n    not_doing_business\n  client.address.address\n  client.address.geolocate()\n  right_address\n  download_screen\n---\ndecoration: user-shield\nquestion: |\n  Consumer Protection Demand Letter\nsubquestion: |\n  This interview will help you generate a consumer protection demand\n  letter, pursuant to G.L. c. 93A.\n\n  This is an example only, and leaves out many key protections that a real\n  interview would use.\nfield: intro_screen\n---\nquestion: |\n  What is your name?\nfields:\n  - First name: client.name.first\n  - Middle name: client.name.middle\n    required: False\n  - Last name: client.name.last\n---\nquestion: |\n  Who do you have a consumer complaint about?\nfields:\n  - Name: opposing_party.name.text\n---\nquestion: |\n  What is your address?\nfields:\n  - Address: client.address.address\n    address autocomplete: True\n  - Unit: client.address.unit\n    required: False\n  - City: client.address.city\n  - State: client.address.state\n    default: \"MA\"\n    code: |\n      states_list() # See https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#states_list\n  - Zip: client.address.zip\n---\nquestion: |\n  What is ${opposing_party}'s address?\nfields:\n  - Address: opposing_party.address.address\n    address autocomplete: True\n  - Unit: opposing_party.address.unit\n    required: False\n  - City: opposing_party.address.city\n  - State: opposing_party.address.state\n    default: \"MA\"\n    code: |\n      states_list() # See https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#states_list\n  - Zip: opposing_party.address.zip\n---\nquestion: |\n  Your addresses\nsubquestion: |\n  Here's a map showing both you and ${opposing_party}.\n\n  ${ map_of(client, opposing_party)}\nfield: right_address\ncomment: |\n  The map_of() function can display a Google Map of one or more addresses or\n  Individuals that have an address attached to them.
