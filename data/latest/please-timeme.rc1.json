Maybe you want to test\nand compare multiple functions. You used to have to write a quick block of code\nto time the execution of your function, and in some cases, even write your own\ndecorator. You might then store the results in some array, compute some stats,\nthen plot it. How many times will you do the same thing over and over again?\n\nFor example:\n \nSay you have a function like this:\n\n```python\n\ndef foo():\n    for i in range(10):\n        print(i)\n\n```\n\n\nNow, if you want to time it, you have to do something like this:\n\n```python\n\nimport time\n\nstart = time.time()\nfoo()\nruntime = time.time() - start\n\nprint(runtime)\n```\n\nWhere do you store the runtime of the function? How do you make sure it is\nassociated with the funciton `foo` with the particular parameters passed to it?\nAlso what happens if you want to run multiple trials and take the average\nruntime?\n\nYou used to have to write all this logic yourself, but here's how it looks with\nTimeMe:\n\n```python\n\nfrom timeme import Timer\n\n@Timer(name='foo_experiment', trials=100)\ndef foo():\n    for i in range(10):\n        print(i)\n        \n        \nfoo(timeme=true)\nruntime_data = Timer.records['foo_experiment']\n\n```\n\nTimeMe automatically tracks the runtime of your function as it executes, so you\ndon't have to write any additional code. It also overrides your function\nparameters and adds an additional keyword argument, `timeme`. This allows you to\ntoggle whether or not you want the runtime to be recorded. You can even run\nmultiple trials. TimeMe will automatically store the data from each run and\ncompute basic stats such as the mean and standard deviation of the trials.\n\nThe data can be retrieved in the Timer object. Want to export it as a CSV or do\neven more analytics?\n\nTimeMe can export the data as a pandas dataframe so you can do as much data\nanalysis as your heart desires.\n\n\nTimeMe is a tool that will make sure you never have to write annoying\nboilerplate code to evaluate the runtime of your code.\n\n## Examples\n\nClone the repo and run the examples to see how TimeMe works for yourself.\n\nTo build the project from github, clone the repo and run the following at the\nroot of the project directory\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\nThen navigate to the examples directory and take a look around.\n\nRun `python compare.py` to get a basic assessment between bubble sort and merge\nsort. The code will run 100 trials on each function, record the runtime, and\nreport the mean and standard deviations.\n\nRun `python varying_input.py` to see the same functions but with varying inputs.\nThis example will also graph the runtime of each function according to the\ninput size. Make sure you have `matplotlib` installed for this example.\n\n\n## Questions?\n\nFeel free to reach out at: rohin.dasari@gmail.com\n\n\n",
