    "description": "# QuickInfo\n This is the library that you've all been searching for, it's built for developers and allows for a variety of web scraping tasks like accessing featured snippets, summaries and wikipedia articles of google webpages. It's built on the web scraping module, selenium.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nUsing this module is very easy. Import it by saying - \n```\nimport quickinfo\n```\nto import the class directly - \n```\nfrom quickinfo import QuickScrape\n```\nThe first step is to create an instance of the class - \n```\np = quickinfo.QuickScrape()\n# OR\np = QuickScrape()\n```\nQuickScrape takes a parameter and that is the path of your chromedriver.exe file, by default, the path set is \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\chromedriver.exe\". Please change this attribute if your chromedriver file is in a different path.\n\nThe next step is to run the process method. It takes an attribute and that is headless. By default, headless is set to True. If set to boolean True, the process of opening the webpage will take place in the background. If set to boolean False, then you can see the process take place.\n\n```\np.process() # Takes arguement True or False\n```\nRemember to run this process method before you use any webscraping functions.\nThis module has three basic methods, they are - \n\n```\nwiki_article = p.wiki_article(query)\nsummary_para = p.summary_para(query)\nfeatured_snippet = p.featured_snippet(query)\n\nprint(wiki_article)\nprint(summary_para)\nprint(featured_snippet)\n```\n\nPlease note that sometimes a summary_para or a wiki_article or a featured_snippet may not be available, hence it will return None.\nIn the end of your program it is very important to say p.end(). This closes the driver and ends the instance.\n\n```\np.end()\n```\n\n## Example code \n```\nfrom quickinfo import QuickScrape\np = QuickScrape() # creates instance\np.process() # runs process in the background\n\nquery = \"programming\"\n\nwiki_article = p.wiki_article(query) # gets wiki article for programming\nsummary_para = p.summary_para(query) # gets summary para for programming\nfeatured_snippet = p.featured_snippet(query) # gets featured snippet for programming\n\nprint(wiki_article)\nprint(summary_para)\nprint(featured_snippet)\n\np.end()\n```\n\n#### Output\n```\nDescription\nComputer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Wikipedia\nProgramming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.\nFeatured snippet from the web\nProgramming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
