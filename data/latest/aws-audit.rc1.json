Command line utility\n> 2. Generate report in excel\n> 3. No additional setup is required\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install AWS Audit is to use pip.\n\n```sh\n$ pip install aws-audit\n```\n\nor install it globally using below command:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo pip install aws-audit\n```\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nVerify which version is installed on system using below command.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit -v\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --version\n```\n\n## Configure AWS Audit\n\n> The AWS IAM user which you are using to configure the utility needs to have \"ReadOnlyAccess\" policy assigned.\n\n> You have to provide AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key to complete the configuration. \n\nOnce you installed and verify the setup of AWS Audit, configure the utility using below command.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --configure\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get help for AWS Audit run below command.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit -h\n```\n\nRun the following command to get list of AWS Services available with utility.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --list-services\n```\n\nRun the following command to get the list of rules for specific service.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --list-rules acm\n```\n\nIf you want to run the audit for specific service and for the specific region:\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --services ec2 --regions us-east-1\n```\n\nor, for multiple services:\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --services ec2,rds --regions us-east-1\n```\n\nor, if you want to run for all regions do not pass regions:\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --services ec2,rds\n```\n\nor, for all services for specific regions:\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit --regions us-east-1,us-east-2\n```\n\nShorthand parameters are also available.\n\n```sh\n$ awsaudit -s ec2 -r us-east-1\n```\n\n## Available Services\n\n| Service | Rule ID | Severity | Rule |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| acm | ACM_001 | High | AWS ACM Certificates are expired. |\n|| ACM_002 | Medium | ACM Certificates are about to expires in 30 days. |\n|| ACM_003 | Low | ACM Certificate issued for wildcard domain. |\n| apigateway | APIGATEWAY_001 | Medium | Production stage APIs not integratated with AWS WAF. |\n|| APIGATEWAY_002 | Medium | Production and Staging stage APIs not configured for SSL certificate. |\n|| APIGATEWAY_003 | Medium | APIs are publicly accessible. |\n| backup | BACKUP_001 | High | Backup vault access policy is not configured to prevent the deletion. |\n|| BACKUP_001 | High | Backup valult is not encrypted with KMS CMK. |\n|| BACKUP_003 | Medium | Backup plans lifecycle configuration is not enabled. |\n| cloudfront | CLOUDFRONT_001 | Low | Cloudfront distributions are not using geo restriction. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_002 | Medium | Cloudfront distributions are using insecure SSL protocols |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_003 | Medium | Cloudfront distributions are not integrated with AWS WAF. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_004 | Medium | Access Logging is not enabled for Cloudfront distributions. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_005 | Medium | CloudFront distributions are not using improved security policies for HTTPS connections. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_006 | Medium | Traffic between the AWS CloudFront distributions and their origins is not encrypted. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_007 | Medium | Cloudfront not using secure viewer protocol policy. |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_008 | Medium | Origin access identity is not enabled for Cloudfront distributions |\n|| CLOUDFRONT_009 | Medium | Field level encryption is not enabled for Cloudfront distributions. |\n| cloudtrail | CLOUDTRAIL_001 | High | Cloudtrail trails are not enabled. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_002 | High | Cloudtrail is not enabled for global services. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_003 | Medium | Cloudtrail logs are not encrypted. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_004 | Medium | Management events are not included into Cloudtrail. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_005 | Medium | File integrity validation not enabled for Cloudtrail. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_006 | Medium | Log delivery failing for Cloudtrail. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_007 | Medium | Bucket logging is not enabled for Cloudtrail. |\n|| CLOUDTRAIL_008 | High | Cloudtrail logging bucket is publicly accessible. |\n| config | CONFIG_001 | High | AWS Config is not enabled. |\n|| CONFIG_001 | Medium | Global resources are not included in AWS Config. |\n|| CONFIG_001 | Medium | AWS Config log delivery failed. |\n| dms | DMS_001 | High | DMS replication instances are not encrypted with KMS CMK. |\n|| DMS_002 | High | DMS replication instances are publicly accessible. |\n|| DMS_003 | Medium | DMS replication instances auto minor version upgrade feature not enabled. |\n| documentdb | DOCUMENTDB_001 | High | DocumentDB clusters are not encrypted with KMS CMK. |\n|| DOCUMENTDB_002 | High | DocumentDB Clusters are not encrypted at rest. |\n|| DOCUMENTDB_003 | Low | Log export feature is not enabled for DocumentDB Clusters. |\n| dynamodb | DYNAMODB_001 | High | DynamoDB is not encrypted with KMS CMK. |\n| ec2 | EC2_001 | High | AMI is not encrypted. |\n|| EC2_002 | Medium | AMI is publicly shared.
