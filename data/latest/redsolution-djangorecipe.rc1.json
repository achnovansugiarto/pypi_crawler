    "description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis is the Redsolution's **fork** of official `djangorecipe <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorecipe/>`_ package.\nFork created for test compability and to propose changes in official repository.\n\nFork changes:\n\n* removed django requirement in djangorecipe package\n* removed parts/django path from sys.path\n\nOriginal documentation:\n\n\nThis buildout recipe can be used to create a setup for Django. It will\nautomatically download Django and install it in the buildout's\nsandbox.\n\nYou can see an example of how to use the recipe below::\n\n  [buildout]\n  parts = satchmo django\n  eggs =\n    ipython\n  versions = versions\n\n  [versions]\n  django = 1.2.5\n\n\n  [satchmo]\n  recipe = gocept.download\n  url = http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/satchmo-0.6.tar.gz\n  md5sum = 659a4845c1c731be5cfe29bfcc5d14b1\n\n  [django]\n  recipe = djangorecipe\n  settings = development\n  eggs = ${buildout:eggs}\n  extra-paths =\n    ${satchmo:location}\n  project = dummyshop\n\n\nSupported options\n=================\n\nThe recipe supports the following options.\n\nproject\n  This option sets the name for your project. The recipe will create a\n  basic structure if the project is not already there.\n\nprojectegg\n  Use this instead of the project option when you want to use an egg\n  as the project. This disables the generation of the project\n  structure.\n\npython\n  This option can be used to specify a specific Python version which can be a\n  different version from the one used to run the buildout.\n\nsettings\n  You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with\n  this option. This is useful if you want to have a different\n  production setup from your development setup. It defaults to\n  `development`.\n\nextra-paths\n  All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python\n  path for the `bin/*` scripts.\n\npth-files\n  Adds paths found from a site `.pth` file to the extra-paths.\n  Useful for things like Pinax which maintains its own external_libs dir.\n\ncontrol-script\n  The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the\n  equivalent of the `manage.py` Django normally creates. By default it\n  uses the name of the section (the part between the `[ ]`).\n\nwsgi\n  An extra script is generated in the bin folder when this is set to\n  `true`. This can be used with mod_wsgi to deploy the project. The\n  name of the script is `control-script.wsgi`.\n\nwsgilog\n  In case the WSGI server you're using does not allow printing to stdout,\n  you can set this variable to a filesystem path - all stdout/stderr data\n  is redirected to the log instead of printed\n\nfcgi\n  Like `wsgi` this creates an extra script within the bin folder. This\n  script can be used with an FCGI deployment.\n\ntest\n  If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a\n  specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to\n  the list of app labels which you want to be tested.\n\ntestrunner\n  This is the name of the testrunner which will be created. It\n  defaults to `test`.\n\nAll following options only have effect when the project specified by\nthe project option has not been created already.\n\nurlconf\n  You can set this to a specific url conf. It will use project.urls by\n  default.\n\nsecret\n  The secret to use for the `settings.py`, it generates a random\n  string by default.\n\n\nFCGI specific settings\n======================\n\nOptions for FCGI can be set within a settings file (`settings.py`). The options\nis `FCGI_OPTIONS`. It should be set to a dictionary. The part below is an\nexample::\n\n  FCGI_OPTIONS = {\n      'method': 'threaded',\n  }\n\n\nAnother example\n===============\n\nThe next example shows you how to use some more of the options::\n\n  [buildout]\n  parts = django extras\n  eggs =\n    hashlib\n\n  [extras]\n  recipe = iw.recipe.subversion\n  urls =\n    http://django-command-extensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-command-extensions\n    http://django-mptt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-mptt\n\n  [django]\n  recipe = djangorecipe\n  settings = development\n  project = exampleproject\n  wsgi = true\n  eggs =\n    ${buildout:eggs}\n  test =\n    someapp\n    anotherapp\n\nExample using .pth files\n========================\n\nPinax uses a .pth file to add a bunch of libraries to its path; we can\nspecify it's directory to get the libraries it specified added to our\npath::\n\n  [buildout]\n  parts\t= PIL\n\t  svncode\n\t  myproject\n  versions=versions\n\n  [versions]\n  django\t= 1.3\n\n  [PIL]\n  recipe\t= zc.recipe.egg:custom\n  egg\t\t= PIL\n  find-links\t= http://dist.repoze.org/\n\n  [svncode]\n  recipe\t= iw.recipe.subversion\n  urls\t\t= http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/tags/0.5.1rc1\tpinax\n\n  [myproject]\n  recipe\t= djangorecipe\n  eggs\t\t=\n    PIL\n  project\t= myproject\n  settings\t= settings\n  extra-paths\t= ${buildout:directory}/myproject/apps\n\t\t  ${svncode:location}/pinax/apps/external_apps\n\t\t  ${svncode:location}/pinax/apps/local_apps\n  pth-files\t= ${svncode:location}/pinax/libs/external_libs\n  wsgi\t\t= true\n\nAbove, we use stock Pinax for pth-files and extra-paths paths for\napps, and our own project for the path that will be found first in the\nlist.  Note that we expect our project to be checked out (e.g., by\nsvn:external) directly under this directory in to 'myproject'.\n\nExample with a different Python version\n=======================================\n\nTo use a different Python version from the one that ran buildout in the\ngenerated script use something like::\n\n  [buildout]\n  parts\t= myproject\n\n  [special-python]\n  executable = /some/special/python\n\n  [myproject]\n  recipe\t= djangorecipe\n  project\t= myproject\n  python\t= special-python\n\nExample configuration for mod_wsgi\n==================================\n\nIf you want to deploy a project using mod_wsgi you could use this\nexample as a starting point::\n\n  <Directory /path/to/buildout>\n         Order deny,allow\n         Allow from all\n  </Directory>\n  <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80>\n         ServerName      my.rocking.server\n         CustomLog       /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/access.log combined\n         ErrorLog        /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/error.log\n         WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/buildout/bin/django.wsgi\n  </VirtualHost>\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n\n- Added correct url to the deprecation warning\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n\n- Fixed Python3 Trove classifiers\n\n1.1\n---\n\n- Support python3.\n- Changed buildout and the tests to run the tests under nose.\n- Removed some old pre 0.99 unittests that dealt with download support. \n\n1.0\n---\n\n- Stable release with a real 1.0 version.\n- Made djangorecipe more pep08 compliant.\n\n0.99\n----\n\n- Djangorecipe now depends on Django. The use of the `version =` statement\n  is deprecated. Specify the django version in the\n  `[versions]` section. Install django via mr.developer if you need to use\n  an svn/git/hg repository. For other uses\n  Versionpin djangorecipe to 0.23.1 if you don't want to upgrade.\n  Thanks to Reinout van Rees for help with this release.\n\n- Removed subversion and download support.\n\n0.23.1\n------\n\n- Added a missing 'import os'\n\n0.23\n----\n\n- Support for settings/urls boilerplate for django 1.2 and django 1.3.\n  It defaults to 1.3 when the version isn't 1.2.\n\n0.22\n----\n\n- Added support for svn urls with spaces. Thanks to Brad103 (fixes #537718).\n\n- Updated code and buildout to use newest zc.recipe.egg,\n  zc.recipe.testrunner and python-dateutil.\n\n0.21\n----\n\n- The admin url is now configured for django 1.1 or higher. Thanks to\n  Sam Charrington (fixes #672220).\n\n- Bootstrap.py updated (fixes #501954).\n\n0.20\n----\n\n- The recipe know makes the `django` package know to setuptools during install.\n  This closes #397864. Thanks to Daniel Bruce and Dan Fairs for the patch.\n\n- Fixed #451065 which fixes a problem with the WSGI log file option.\n\n- Added the posibilty to configure more FCGI related settings. Thanks to Vasily\n  Sulatskov for the patch.\n\n0.19.2\n------\n\n- The generated WSGI & FCGI scripts are now properly removed when\n  options change (fixes #328182). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the\n  patch.\n\n- Scripts are now updated when dependencies change. This fixes #44658,\n  thanks to Paul Carduner for the patch.\n\n0.19.1\n------\n\n- Applied fix for the change in WSGI script generation. The previous\n  release did not work properly.\n\n0.19\n----\n\n- When running again with non-newest set the recipe will no longer\n  update the Subversion checkout. Thanks to vinilios for the patch.\n\n- The WSGI and FCGI scripts are now generated using Buildout's own\n  system. This makes them more similar to the generated manage script\n  with regard to the setup of paths. Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the\n  patch.\n\n0.18\n----\n\n- Paths from eggs and extra-paths now get precedence over the default\n  system path (fixes #370420). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the patch.\n\n- The generated WSGI script now uses the `python` option if\n  present. This fixes #361695.\n\n0.17.4\n------\n\n- Fixed a problem when not running in verbose mode (fixes #375151).\n\n0.17.3\n------\n\n- Removed dependency on setuptools_bzr since it does not seem to work\n  like I expected.\n\n0.17.2\n------\n\n- Changed the download code to use urllib2. This should make it work\n  from behind proxies (fixes #362822). Thanks to pauld for the patch.\n\n0.17.1\n------\n\n- Fixed a problem with the new WSGI logging option #348797. Thanks to\n  Bertrand Mathieu for the patch.\n\n- Disable generation of the WSGI log if \"wsgilog\" isn't set, thanks to\n  Jacob Kaplan-Moss for the patch.\n\n- Updated buildout.cfg and .bzrignore, thanks Jacob Kaplan-Moss.\n\n0.17\n----\n\n- Added an option to specify a log file for output redirection from\n  the WSGI script. Thanks to Guido Wesdorp for the patch.\n\n0.16\n----\n\n- Subversion aliases are now supported (something like\n  svn+mystuff://myjunk). Thanks to Remco for the patch.\n\n0.15.2\n------\n\n- Update to move pth-files finder from the __init__ method to the\n  install method so it runs in buildout-order, else it looks for pth\n  files in dirs that may not yet exist. Thanks to Chris Shenton for\n  the update to his original patch.\n\n0.15.1\n------\n\n- Update to make the previously added pth-files option better\n  documented.\n\n0.15\n----\n\n- Added \"pth-files\" option to add libraries to extra-paths from\n  site .pth files. Thanks to Chris Shenton for the patch.\n\n0.14\n----\n\n- The recipe now supports creating a FCGI script. Thanks to Jannis\n  Leidel for the patch.\n\n- When downloading a Django recipe for the first time the recipe now\n  properly reports the url it is downloading from.\n\n0.13\n----\n\n- Specifying a user name within a subversion url now works. The code\n  that determined the revision has been updated. This fixes issue\n  #274004. Thanks to Remco for the patch.\n\n- Updated the template for creating new projects. It now uses the\n  current admin system when generating it's `urls.py` file. This fixes\n  issue #276255. Thanks to Roland for the patch.\n\n0.12.1\n------\n\n- Re-upload since CHANGES.txt was missing from the release\n\n0.12\n----\n\n- The recipe no longer executes subversion to determine whether the\n  versions is to be downloaded using subversion. This fixes issue\n  #271145. Thanks to Kapil Thangavelu for the patch.\n\n- Changed the `pythonpath` option to `extra-paths`. This makes the\n  recipe more consistent with other recipes (see issue #270908).\n\n0.11\n----\n\n- Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure\n  the update method is always called. It would not be called in the\n  previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it\n  wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout\n  saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to\n  un-install & install.\n\n- When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi\n  file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been\n  fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.\n\n- The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced\n  and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe\n  more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch\n  from issue #260628.\n\n0.10\n----\n\n- The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a\n  release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes\n  issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and\n  suggesting a solution.\n\n- Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running\n  the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for\n  reporting this.\n\n- Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This\n  disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks\n  to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n\n- Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing\n  manifest file\n\n0.9\n---\n\n- The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth\n  settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).\n\n- The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use\n  this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the\n  standard svn @ syntax\n\n- The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by\n  the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.",
