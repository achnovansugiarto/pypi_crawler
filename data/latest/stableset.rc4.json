    "description": "[![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/stableset.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stableset)\r\n\r\nA StableSet is a mutable set that remembers its insertion order.\r\nFeaturing: Fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing.\r\nBut slow O(N) Index Lookup.\r\n\r\nAn OrderedSet is a mutable data structure that is a hybrid of a list and a set.\r\nIt remembers its insertion order so that every entry has an index that can be looked up. \r\nFeaturing: O(1) Index lookup, insertion, iteration and membership testing.\r\nBut slow O(N) Deletion.\r\n\r\nBoth have similar interfaces but differ in respect of their implementation and performance.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`stableset` is available on PyPI and packaged as a wheel. You can list it\r\nas a dependency of your project, in whatever form that takes.\r\n\r\nTo install it into your current Python environment:\r\n\r\n    pip install stableset\r\n\r\nTo install the code for development, after checking out the repository:\r\n\r\n    pip install flit\r\n    flit install\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n\r\nAn OrderedSet is created and used like a set:\r\n\r\n    >>> from ordered_set import OrderedSet\r\n\r\n    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')\r\n\r\n    >>> letters\r\n    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd'])\r\n\r\n    >>> 'r' in letters\r\n    True\r\n\r\nIt is efficient to find the index of an entry in an OrderedSet, or find an\r\nentry by its index. To help with this use case, the `.add()` method returns\r\nthe index of the added item, whether it was already in the set or not.\r\n\r\n    >>> letters.index('r')\r\n    2\r\n\r\n    >>> letters[2]\r\n    'r'\r\n\r\n    >>> letters.add('r')\r\n    2\r\n\r\n    >>> letters.add('x')\r\n    5\r\n\r\nOrderedSets implement the union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`)\r\noperators like sets do.\r\n\r\n    >>> letters |= OrderedSet('shazam')\r\n\r\n    >>> letters\r\n    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])\r\n\r\n    >>> letters & set('aeiou')\r\n    OrderedSet(['a'])\r\n\r\n    >>> letters -= 'abcd'\r\n\r\n    >>> letters\r\n    OrderedSet(['r', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])\r\n\r\nThe `__getitem__()` and `index()` methods have been extended to accept any\r\niterable except a string, returning a list, to perform NumPy-like \"fancy\r\nindexing\".\r\n\r\n    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')\r\n\r\n    >>> letters[[0, 2, 3]]\r\n    ['a', 'r', 'c']\r\n\r\n    >>> letters.index(['a', 'r', 'c'])\r\n    [0, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nOrderedSet implements `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` so it can be pickled,\r\nand implements the abstract base classes `collections.MutableSet` and\r\n`collections.Sequence`.\r\n\r\nOrderedSet can be used as a generic collection type, similar to the collections\r\nin the `typing` module like List, Dict, and Set. For example, you can annotate\r\na variable as having the type `OrderedSet[str]` or `OrderedSet[Tuple[int,\r\nstr]]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## OrderedSet in data science applications\r\n\r\nAn OrderedSet can be used as a bi-directional mapping between a sparse\r\nvocabulary and dense index numbers. As of version 3.1, it accepts NumPy arrays\r\nof index numbers as well as lists.\r\n\r\nThis combination of features makes OrderedSet a simple implementation of many\r\nof the things that `pandas.Index` is used for, and many of its operations are\r\nfaster than the equivalent pandas operations.\r\n\r\nFor further compatibility with pandas.Index, `get_loc` (the pandas method for\r\nlooking up a single index) and `get_indexer` (the pandas method for fancy\r\nindexing in reverse) are both aliases for `index` (which handles both cases\r\nin OrderedSet).\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\nStableSet was implemented by Idan Miara, built upon the foundations of OrderedSet.\r\nOrderedSet was implemented by Elia Robyn Lake (maiden name: Robyn Speer).\r\nJon Crall contributed changes and tests to make it fit the Python set API.\r\nRoman Inflianskas added the original type annotations.\r\n\r\n## Comparisons\r\n\r\nA StableSet is a mutable set that remembers its insertion order.\r\nFeaturing: Fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing.\r\nBut slow O(N) Index Lookup.\r\n\r\nAn OrderedSet is a mutable data structure that is a hybrid of a list and a set.\r\nIt remembers its insertion order so that every entry has an index that can be looked up. \r\nFeaturing: O(1) Index lookup, insertion, iteration and membership testing.\r\nBut slow O(N) Deletion.\r\n\r\nBoth have similar interfaces but differ in respect of their implementation and performance.\r\n\r\nThe original implementation of OrderedSet was a [recipe posted to ActiveState\r\nRecipes][recipe] by Raymond Hettiger, released under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n[recipe]: https://code.activestate.com/recipes/576694-orderedset/\r\n\r\nHettiger's implementation kept its content in a doubly-linked list referenced by a\r\ndict. As a result, looking up an item by its index was an O(N) operation, while\r\ndeletion was O(1).\r\n\r\nThis version of OrderedSet makes different trade-offs for the sake of efficient lookups. \r\nIts content is a standard Python list instead of a doubly-linked list. This\r\nprovides O(1) lookups by index at the expense of O(N) deletion, as well as\r\nslightly faster iteration.\r\n\r\n## Other implementations \r\n\r\nThe included implementation of OrderedSet is fully compatible with the following implementations (which are not fully compatible with each other):\r\n* https://pypi.org/project/ordered-set/ - by Elia Robyn Lake (original implementation of `OrderedSet`)\r\n* https://pypi.org/project/orderedset/ - by Simon Percivall (faster implementation of `OrderedSet` using Cython, which currently only works for Python<3.9)\r\n\r\nThe included implementation of StableSet is fully compatible with the following implementation:\r\n* https://pypi.org/project/Ordered-set-37/ - by Xavier Bustamante Talavera (Similar basic implementation for `StableSet`, but named `OrderedSet`)\r\n",
