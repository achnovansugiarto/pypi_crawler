[Validate Response Contains Expected Response](https://accruent.github.io/robotframework-zoomba/APILibraryDocumentation.html#Validate%20Response%20Contains%20Expected%20Response) takes your received request and compares it to your expected data. If there are any errors found it will report line by line what they are.\n```robotframework\nValidate Response Contains Expected Response    ${json_actual_response}      ${json_expected_response}\n```\nIf there is any mismatched data it will look something like this:\n```\nKey(s) Did Not Match:\n------------------\nKey: pear\nExpected: fish\nActual: bird\n------------------\nFull List Breakdown:\nExpected: [{'apple': 'cat', 'banana': 'dog', 'pear': 'fish'}, {'apple': 'cat', 'banana': 'mice', 'pear': 'bird'}, {'apple': 'dog', 'banana': 'mice', 'pear': 'cat'}]\nActual: [{'apple': 'cat', 'banana': 'dog', 'pear': 'bird'}]\n\nPlease see differing value(s)\n```\nIf you wanted to ignore a key such as the 'update_date' you would simply set the 'ignored_keys' variable to that key or a list of keys:\n```robotframework\nValidate Response Contains Expected Response    ${json_actual_response}      ${json_expected_response}      ignored_keys=update_date\nValidate Response Contains Expected Response    ${json_actual_response}      ${json_expected_response}      ignored_keys=${list_of_keys}\n```\n\n#### [Mobile Library](https://accruent.github.io/robotframework-zoomba/MobileLibraryDocumentation.html):\nExtending the [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) we again add some quality of life 'Wait For And' type keywords:\n```robotframework\nWait For And Click Element      locator\nWait For And Click Text         text\nWait Until Element Contains     locator     text\n```\nThere are of course additional features that have yet to be implemented in AppiumLibrary:\n```robotframework\nDrag and Drop      source_locator     target_locator\nDrag And Drop By Offset     locator    x_offset     y_offset\nScroll Down To Text       text\nScroll Up To Text         text\n```\n\n#### [Desktop Library](https://accruent.github.io/robotframework-zoomba/DesktopLibraryDocumentation.html):\nAlso extends [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) to tailor it Windows desktop automation. This includes enhancements to base keywords such as [Open Application](https://accruent.github.io/robotframework-zoomba/DesktopLibraryDocumentation.html#Open%20Application) or [Click Element](https://accruent.github.io/robotframework-zoomba/DesktopLibraryDocumentation.html#Click%20Element) to perform better for windows. Other notable additions include:\n\nEasily switching to new windows or the desktop session:\n```robotframework\nSwitch Application      Desktop\nSwitch Application By Name     remote_url    new_window_name\n```\nA variety of keywords for controlling the mouse:\n```robotframework\nMouse Over Element     locator\nMouse Over and Click Element    locator\nMouse over and Context Click Element    locator\nMouse Over By Offset     x_offset    y_offset\n```\nKeywords for dragging and dropping:\n```robotframework\nDrag and Drop      source_locator     target_locator\nDrag And Drop By Offset     locator    x_offset     y_offset\n```\nThe ability to send key commands to the application:\n```robotframework\nSend Keys     \\\\ue00      p     \\\\ue00\nSend Keys To Element    locator     a     b     c\n```\nSelecting an element from a combobox:\n```robotframework\nSelect Element From ComboBox     combobox_locator      element_locator\n```\n\nGetting Started\n----------------\n\nThe Zoomba library is easily installed using the [`setup.py`](https://github.com/Accruent/robotframework-zoomba/blob/master/setup.py) file in the home directory.\nSimply run the following command to install Zoomba and it's dependencies:\n\n```python\npip install robotframework-zoomba\n```\n\nIf you decide to pull the repo locally to make contributions or just want to play around with the code\nyou can install Zoomba by running the following from the *root directory*:\n```python\npip install .\n```\n\nTo access the keywords in the library simply add the following to your robot file settings (depending on what you need):\n```python\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary    Zoomba.APILibrary\nLibrary    Zoomba.GUILibrary\nLibrary    Zoomba.SOAPLibrary\nLibrary    Zoomba.MobileLibrary\nLibrary    Zoomba.DesktopLibrary\n```\n\nAdditional Setup Information\n---------------------------------\n\nIf you plan to run Mobile or Windows desktop automation you will need to have a running appium server. To do so first have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\ninstalled and then run the following:\n```python\nnpm install -g appium\nappium\n```\nAlternatively [Appium Desktop](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases) can be used.\n\nFor Windows automation we suggest [installing and using the WinAppDriver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases) without Appium as it seems to be much more stable.\n\nExamples\n------------\nExample tests can be found in the [samples directory](https://github.com/Accruent/robotframework-zoomba/tree/master/samples).\n\nThe [test directory](https://github.com/Accruent/robotframework-zoomba/tree/master/test) may also contain tests but be aware that these are used for testing releases and may not be as straight forward to use as the ones in the [samples directory](https://github.com/Accruent/robotframework-zoomba/tree/master/samples).\n\n\nContributing\n-----------------\n\nTo make contributions please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Accruent/robotframework-zoomba/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) guidelines.\n\nAdditionally if you run the following command new documentation will be generated on each commit :\n```python\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\n```\n\nSupport\n---------------\nGeneral Robot Framework questions should be directed to the [community forum](https://forum.robotframework.org/).\n\nContact the team at `robosquad@accruent.com` or create an issue with specific requests or questions regarding the Zoomba libraries!",
