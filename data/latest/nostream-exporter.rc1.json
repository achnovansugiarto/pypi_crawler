    "description": "# Prometheus openmetrics for Nostream\n\n![events by kind](docs/screenshot-01.png)\n\nA devops component for directly monitoring your [nostream relay](https://github.com/Cameri/nostream), which can be integrated with your self-hosted SRE stack. If you don't have a monitoring system set up already, this won't be useful to you. It's basically a python script that runs Postregsql queries to compile basic metrics.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\n``` bash\npip install nostream-exporter\n```\n\nDefine the connection parameters to your Nostream via environment variables. There are multiple ways you can set it up. One example is to create an `.env` file with the following contents:\n\n```bash\nexport DB_HOST=/var/run/postgresql\nexport DB_PORT=5432\nexport DB_NAME=nostream\nexport DB_USER=nostream\nexport DB_PASSWORD='hunter2'\nexport METRICS_PORT=9101\nexport METRICS_BIND=127.0.0.1\n```\n\nBoth the `METRICS_PORT` and `METRICS_BIND` options are optional, the defaults are shown.\n\nI would recommend running this as an unprivileged user via systemd (or anything comparable):\n\n```bash\nuseradd -mb /opt -k /dev/null -s $(which nologin) nostream_exporter\n```\n\nCreate `/etc/systemd/system/nostream_exporter.service`:\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=Basic openmetrics for Nostream nostr relay\n\n[Service]\nUser=nostream_exporter\nGroup=nostream_exporter\nEnvironmentFile=/opt/nostream_exporter/.env\nExecStart=nostream_exporter\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=2m\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nConfirm that it is serving metrics:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9101/metrics\n...\n# HELP events Count of events by kind\n# TYPE events gauge\nevents{kind=\"7\"} 48184.0\nevents{kind=\"1\"} 24659.0\nevents{kind=\"6\"} 3737.0\nevents{kind=\"1984\"} 3236.0\nevents{kind=\"4\"} 2265.0\nevents{kind=\"other\"} 762.0\n\n```\n\n## Development\n\nClone the repo and install dependencies into a local virtual environment:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com/bleetube/nostream_exporter\ncd nostream_exporter\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --editable .\nsource .env\nnostream_exporter\n```\n\nNote that there is a difference between `source .env` and systemd EnvironmentFile which is that you'll need to have the export keyword. i.e. `export DB_NAME=nostream`\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Include tests\n- Change `print()` messages into sensible logging with configuration debug levels.\n- Review events table to possibly discover more metrics.\n- Dockerfile\n",
