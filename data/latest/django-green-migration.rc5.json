    "description": "# django-green-migrations\nVersion 1.0.5\n\nWhile the server is running,\nif you deploy a new version which contains a migration that drop a field, it will make your production down. \nThis is because the migration will be executed before the new code is deployed.\nThis package will help you to avoid this problem.\n\n## Normal deployment\n1. Deploy new code to server\n2. Keep server running\n3. Run migrations\n4. Switch to new code\n5. Destroy old code\n\nAt step 3, if the migration contains a field drop, the server will be down.\n\n## Green deployment\n1. Deploy new code to server\n2. Keep server running\n3. Run green migration ```python manage.py green_migrate > output.json```\n4. Run migrations\n5. Switch to new code\n6. Destroy old code\n7. Run pos green migration ```python manage.py pos_green_migrate output.json```\n\nAt step 3, it will modify `drop` migration to `nullable and blankable` migration, this will help both old and new code to work.\n\nAt step 7, it will read the output from step 3 to drop fields, this will help to clean up the database.\n\n## Installation\n1. Install package\n```pip install django-green-migration```\n2. Add `green_migration` to `INSTALLED_APPS`\n3. Setup deployment like above explanation (make sure don't commit changes at step 3 to git)\n",
