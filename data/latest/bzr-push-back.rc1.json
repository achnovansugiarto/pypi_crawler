So\nthere is a plugin which set default push location. Some time ago there was also\na discussion about the subject on the Bazaar mailing list:\n\nhttp://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.bazaar-ng.general/37041\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way to install is to branch the plugin directly from Launchpad::\n\n    $ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins\n    $ bzr branch lp:bzr-push-back push_back",
