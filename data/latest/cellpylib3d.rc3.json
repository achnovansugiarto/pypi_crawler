    "description": "# CellPyLib 3D\n\nCellPyLib is a library for working with 1- and 2-dimensional _k_-color Cellular Automata in Python. CellPyLib-3d is an extension of this library, bringing support for 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional layered automata.\n\n[![testing status](https://github.com/Cutwell/cellpylib-3d/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Cutwell/cellpylib-3d/actions)\n[![latest version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cellpylib3d?style=flat-square&logo=PyPi&logoColor=white&color=blue)](https://pypi.org/project/cellpylib3d/)\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nimport cellpylib3d\n\n# empty 3d grid\ngrid = cellpylib3d.init_simple3d(10, 10, 10, val=0) # init empty 3d grid\n\n# oscilating shape from donut\ngrid[:, [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7], 4, [4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]] = 1\n\n# run using GOL ruleset for N timesteps\ncellular_automaton = cellpylib3d.evolve3d(grid, timesteps=50, neighbourhood='Moore', apply_rule=cellpylib3d.game_of_life_rule_3d)\n\n# animate\ncellpylib3d.plot3d_animate(cellular_automaton, title='3D Game of Life')\n\n```\n\n![](/resources/3d_gol.gif)\n\n\n```python\nimport cellpylib3d\n\n# empty 3d grid\ngrid = cellpylib3d.init_simple3d(10, 10, 7, val=0) # init empty 3d grid\n\n# oscilating shape from donut\ngrid[:, [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7], 4, [4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]] = 1\n\n# each layer requires a separate rule\nrules = [cellpylib3d.game_of_life_rule_parallel,] * 7\n\n# run using GOL ruleset for N timesteps\ncellular_automaton = cellpylib3d.evolveParallel(grid, timesteps=50, neighbourhood='Moore', apply_rules=rules)\n\n# animate\ncellpylib3d.plotParallel_animate(cellular_automaton, title='Parallel Game of Life')\n\n```\n\n![](/resources/parallel_gol.gif)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCellPyLib can be installed via pip:\n\n`pip install cellpylib3d`\n\nRequirements for using this library are Python 3.7, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This extension library largely followsHave a look at the documentation, located at [cellpylib.org](https://cellpylib.org), for more information.\n\n\n## 3D extensions\n\n![](/resources/random_3d_gol.gif)\n\n**Initialising 3d automata**\nArguments for tabled functions mirror 2d equivalent CellPyLib `init_simple2d` and `init_random2d` functions, unless noted.\n\n| Func | Special Args | Docs |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| `init_simple3d` | Requires additional `layers` arg. | Returns a matrix initialized with zeroes, with its center value set to the specified value, or 1 by default. |\n| `init_random3d` |  Requires additional `layers` arg. | Returns a randomly initialized matrix with values consisting of numbers in {0,...,k - 1}, where k = 2 by default. |\n\n**Evolving**\nArguments for tabled functions mirror 2d equivalent CellPyLib `evolve2d` function.\n\n| Func | Docs |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| `evolve3d` | Evolve cellular automata in 3-dimensional space using 3d-aware ruleset. |\n\n**Plotting**\nArguments for tabled functions mirror 2d equivalent CellPyLib `plot2d` and `plot2d_animate` functions, unless noted\n\n| Func | Special Args | Docs |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| `plot3d` | Replaces `cmap` argument with options for voxel cube face color and edge color (defaults `face_color='#1f77b4'`, `edge_color='gray'`) | Plot 3d CA at given timestep using voxels. |\n| `plot3d_animate` | Replaces `cmap` argument with options for voxel cube face color and edge color (defaults `face_color='#1f77b4'`, `edge_color='gray'`) | Animate 3d CA using voxels. |\n\n## Parallel extensions\n\n![](/resources/random_parallel_gol.gif)\n\nParallel CA are a more customisable form of 3d CA. Instead of applying a single 3d-aware ruleset to an entire CA, each layer of a parallel CA can have a seperate ruleset. This can be helpful for simulations with weak interaction between layers.\n\n**Initialising parallel automata**\nInitialise your CA using the 3d functions described above. Parallel CA are treated at regular 3d shapes at a base level.\n\n**Evolving**\nArguments for tabled functions mirror 2d equivalent CellPyLib `evolve2d` function.\n\n| Func | Docs |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| `evolveParallel` | Evolve a layers of a 3d cellular automata using seperate 2D/3d-aware rulesets. |\n\n**Plotting**\nArguments for tabled functions mirror 2d equivalent CellPyLib `plot2d` and `plot2d_animate` functions.\n\n| Func | Docs |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| `plotParallel` | Slice the 3D CA and subplot each layer for a given timestep. |\n| `plotParallel_animate` | Slice the 3D CA and animate each subplot of each layer. |\n\n--------------------\n## Development\n\nCreate a Conda environment from the provided environment YAML file:\n```\n$ conda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\n**Documentation**\n\nTo build the Sphinx documentation locally, from the `doc` directory:\n```\n$ make clean html\n```\nThe generated files will be in `_build/html`.\n\nTo build the documentation for publication, from the `doc` directory:\n```\n$ make github\n```\nThe generated files will be in `_build/html` and in the `site/docs` folder.\n\n**Testing**\n\nThere are a number of unit tests for this project. To run the tests:\n```\n$ python3 -m pytest tests\n```\n\nIf the `pytest-cov` package is installed, a coverage report can be generated by running the tests with:\n```\n$ python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=cellpylib3d\n```\n--------------------\n\n## License\n[Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)\n",
