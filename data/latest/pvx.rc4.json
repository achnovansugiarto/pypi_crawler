If it is installed silently, then everything is ready, otherwise add `PVX_PY_BUILD_PATH=/your/pyenv/path/plugins/python-build` to `env` (`plugins/python-build` is usually fixed).\n\n## 🔧 Usage\n\n- List  version number that you can download.\n\n    ```bash\n    pvx py archive \n\n    # If you want to filter it, do this\n    pvx py archive 3.10\n    ```\n\n- Install.\n\n    ```bash\n    pvx py insetall 3.10.4\n    ```\n\n- List versions of installed.\n\n    ```bash\n    pvx py list\n    ```\n\n- Remove the specified version of Python.\n\n    ```bash\n    pvx py remove 3.10.4\n    ```\n\n- Create a virtual environment (pvx use [Python Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and compatible with its parameters)\n\n    ```bash\n    # All default (current python and default venv prompt)\n    pvx venv new\n\n    # Specify the version (which install by pvx)\n    pvx venv new 3.10.4\n\n    # Use existing Python\n    pvx venv new ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python\n\n    # Use venv's parameters, such as specifying prompt\n    pvx venv new 3.10.4 --prompt venv_prompt_name\n\n    # Use current python and venv's parameters\n    pvx venv new --prompt venv_prompt_name\n    ```\n\n- List all virtual environments\n\n    ```bash\n    # You'll see a table , highlight the activate one.\n    pvx venv list\n    ```\n\n- Activate virtual environment with `PROMPT`\n\n    ```bash\n    # use `pvx venv list` to show prompt\n    pvx venv activate prompt_name\n    ```\n\n- Remove virtual environment with `PROMPT`\n\n    ```bash\n    # use `pvx venv list` to show prompt\n    pvx venv remove prompt_name\n    ```\n\n## Optional environment variable\n\n- `PVX_ROOT_PATH`: pvx home path. `Default: ~/.pvx`\n- `PVX_PYTHON_INSTALLATION_PATH`: The installation folder for Python. `Default: ~/${PVX_ROOT_PATH}/versions`\n- `PVX_VENV_IN_PROJECT`: Whether the virtual environment is installed in the project. `Default: true`\n- `PVX_VENV_DIR_NAME_IN_PROJECT`: The folder name of virtual environment. `Default: .venv`\n- `PVX_VENV_EXTERNAL_PATH`: If `PVX_VENV_IN_PROJECT` is false, the virtual environment is installed externally rather than in the project. `Default: ~/${PVX_ROOT_PATH}/venv`\n- `PVX_PY_BUILD_HOME`: pyenv plugin python-build home path. `Default: ~/.pyenv/plugins/python-build`\n\n## 🌟 Extend functionality\n\nIf you want to extend commands, be familiar with the following points.\n\n1. The folder where the `pvx.py` file resides is the `root`.\n2. `root/commands` is the folder where the `.py` command scripts are stored.\n3. If `filenamed` is true, use the file name command, otherwise use the argument to `@click.command`.\n        - The `.py` files are named `pvx_{group}_{command}.py`.For example: `pvx_py_install.py`, which means we can call it with `pvx py install`.\n4. `.py` file must have a method called `cli` and decorated with `@click.command` .\n\n## 👻 Thanks\n\npvx was my experiment after studying `pyenv`, `poetry` `rich` and `click`. Thank them for their efforts, fun 😁 ~\n\n- [python-build (pyenv's plugin)](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/tree/master/plugins/python-build), which pvx depend to install different versions of Python\n- [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)\n- [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.\n- [click](https://github.com/pallets/click), a python composable command line interface toolkit\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.
