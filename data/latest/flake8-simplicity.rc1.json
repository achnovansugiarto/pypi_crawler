    "description": "**Lint your Python like it was 1999!**\n\nDo you ever miss the days when your coworker couldn't\nconvert 10 straightforward lines of Python into\na mess of decorators and multiline dictionary\ncomprehensions?\n\nWould you like it if no-one could make annoying comments\non your PR about how you could make it 'nicer' by\nusing with, walrus operators, and yield?\n\nCould you pass on deciding to rewrite your\nentire application to use async?\n\nThink that maybe there are 27 ways to do it in today's\nPython, and that that's pretty damn annoying?\n\n*Then install flake8-simplicity today.*\n\nIf this gets added to the CI for an open source project\nof decent size with decent usage (without a mess of # noqa),\nand it passes on master, drop me a line and I'll send you a postcard.\nOffer limited to the first 5 participants.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nI was whinging aimlessly about the latest changes to Python\nto a co-worker, as you do, and claimed that sometimes I wish\nI could do:\n\n```\nfrom __past__ import simplicity\n```\n\nBut hacking the Python interpreter seemed non-trivial, there's no\nchance that the PEP would get up, and also no-one would use it.\nA linter, on the other hand...\n\n\n# Usage\n\nThis is a flake8 plugin. So...\n\n```\npip install flake8-simplicity\n\nflake8 myfile.py  # or however you like to lint\n```\n\nErrors from flake8 simplicity are prefixed with SPL, and are\nperhaps not the most informative. A PR to create a humourous\nmessage for each infelicity would be gladly accepted.\n\n\n# PS\n\nYes, I'm aware of the irony of using `yield` statements\nin this code.",
