It uses computationally inferred epigenomes of single cells to identify transcription factors that determine cellular states. The regulatory inference is based on a two-step process:\n\n1) Single cells are matched to a combination of (bulk) reference H3K27ac ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq profiles.\n2) Using the H3K27ac ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq signal in enhancers associated with hypervariable genes the TF motif activity is inferred.\n\nCurrently five different references are available, three for human and two for mouse. Different\ndata sets may give different results, based on a) the type of data (H3K27ac\nChIP-seq or ATAC-seq) and b) the different cell types being represented. While\nSCEPIA does not require exact matching cell types to give good results, it does\nwork best when relatively similar cell types are in the reference. \n\nThe following references can be used:\n\n* `ENCODE.H3K27ac.human` - All H3K27ac experiments from ENCODE. Includes cell\n  lines, tissues\n* `BLUEPRINT.H3K27ac.human` - All H3K27ac cell types from BLUEPRINT (mostly\n  hematopoietic cell types)\n* `Domcke.ATAC.fetal.human` - Fetal single cell-based ATAC-seq clusters from\n  15 different organs ([Domcke et al 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aba7612)).\n* `Cusanovich.ATAC.mouse` - ATAC-seq data of single cell-based clusters from 13\n  adult mouse tissues ([Cusanovich et al, 2018](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.052)).\n* `ENCODE.H3K27ac.mouse` - All H3K27ac experiments from mouse ENCODE.\n\nSo sorry, but only human and mouse are supported for now. However, if you have data from other species you can try it if gene names tend to match. Make sure you use gene names as identifiers, and `scepia` will run fine. In our (very limited) experience this *can* yield good results, but there are a lot of assumptions on conservation of regulatory interactions. If you have a large collection of ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq reference experiments available you can also create your own reference with `ScepiaDataset.create()`. This is not well-documented at the moment, let us know if you need help to do so.\n\n## Requirements and installation\n\nYou will need [conda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) using the [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel.\n\nMake sure you have conda installed. If you have not used bioconda before, first set up the necessary channels (in this order!). You only have to do this once.\n\n```\n$ conda config --add channels defaults\n$ conda config --add channels bioconda\n$ conda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\n\nNow you can create an environment for scepia:\n\n``` \nconda create -n scepia scepia>=0.5.0\n# Note: if you want to use scepia in a Jupyter notebook, you also have to install the following packages: `ipywidgets nb_conda`.\nconda activate scepia\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Before using SCEPIA\n\nYou have to install genomes that scepia uses through [genomepy](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/genomepy). The genomes that are used include `hg38`, `hg19`, `mm10` and `mm9`, depending on the reference. For example, to install `hg38`:\n\n```\n$ conda activate scepia\n$ genomepy install hg38\n```\n\nYou only need to do this once for each genome.\n\n**Note: this is independent of which genome / annotation you used for your\nsingle cell RNA-seq!**\n\n### Command line\n\nRemember to activate the environment before using it\n\n```\nconda activate scepia\n```\n\nThe command line script `scepia infer_motifs` works on any file that is supported by [`scanpy.read()`](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/scanpy.read.html). We recommend to process your data, including QC, filtering, normalization and clustering, using scanpy. If you save the results to an `.h5ad` file, `scepia` can continue from your analysis to infer motif activity. However, the command line tool also works on formats such as CSV files or tab-separated files. In that case, `scepia` will run some basic pre-processing steps. To run `scepia`:\n\n```\nscepia infer_motifs <input_file> <output_dir>\n```\n\n### Jupyter notebook tutorial\n\nA tutorial on how to use `scepia` interactively in Jupyter can be found [here](tutorials/scepia_tutorial.ipynb).\n\nSingle cell data should be loaded in an [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anndata.AnnData.html) object.\nMake sure of the following:\n\n* Gene names are used in `adata.var_names`, not Ensembl identifiers or any other gene identifiers.\n* `adata.raw` stores the raw, log-transformed single cell expression data.\n* The main `adata` object is filtered to contain only hypervariable genes.\n* Louvain or Leiden clustering has been run.\n\nOnce these preprocessing steps are met, `infer_motifs()` can be run to infer the TF motif activity. The first time the reference data will be downloaded, so this will take somewhat longer.\n\n```\nfrom scepia.sc import infer_motifs\n\n# load and preprocess single-cell data using scanpy\n\nadata = infer_motifs(adata, dataset=\"ENCODE.H3K27ac.human\")\n```\n\nThe resulting `AnnData` object can be saved with the `.write()` method to a `h5ad` file. However, due to some difficulties with storing the motif annotation in the correct format, the file cannot be loaded with the `scanpy` load() method. Instead, use the `read()` method from the scepia package:\n\n```\nfrom scepia.sc import read\nadata = read(\"my_saved_data.h5ad\")\n```\n\nThe resulting object can now be treated as a normal `AnnData` object.\n\n\n### Determine enhancer-based regulatory potential\n\nThe approach to determine the enhancer-based regulatory potential (ERP) score per gene is based on the approach developed by [Wang et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101%2Fgr.201574.115). There is one difference, in this approach the score is calculates based only on H3K27ac signal in enhancers. We use log-transformed, z-score normalized H3K27ac read counts in 2kb windows centered at enhancer locations. The ERP score is used to match single cell RNA-seq data to the reference H3K27ac profiles.\n\nTo use, an H3K27ac BAM file is needed (mapped to hg38). The `-N` argument\nspecifies the number of threads to use.\n\n```\nscepia area27 <bamfile> <outfile> -N 12\n```",
