We can follow next steps:\n\n  #. Go to *Contacts*\n  #. Create a new one\n  #. Check the option **Is driver** at *Routific* section\n  #. Check the option **Driver active**\n\nIf we want to divide the charge filtering by types of products, we can check at\n*Inventory > Configuration > Attributes* what attribute defines the type by checking the\nfield **Is routific type**.

Press *Create*\n  #. Select the affected pickings\n  #. You can delete the non-needed drivers\n  #. *Save* the project\n\nSending Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNow you can send the information to Routific by pressing the button\n**Send information to Routific**.\n\nOnce the info is sent to routific, you should optimice the route at\n`Routific Platform <https://routific.com/>`_\n\nYou can add new stops to the route by adding new pickings and clicking to\n*Send new stops*\n\nGetting Solution\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNow you can get the solution by clicking at **Process solution**\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/issues/new?body=module:%20connector_routific%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * Carlos Roca\n  * Sergio Teruel\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-CarlosRoca13| image:: https://github.com/CarlosRoca13.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/CarlosRoca13\n    :alt: CarlosRoca13\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-CarlosRoca13| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/delivery-carrier <https://github.com/OCA/delivery-carrier/tree/13.0/connector_routific>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
