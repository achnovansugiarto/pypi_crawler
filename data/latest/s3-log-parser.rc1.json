    "description": "S3 Log Parser\r\n=============\r\n\r\nParses log lines from an s3 log file.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    import s3_log_parser\r\n    line_parser = s3_log_parser.make_parser(\"%BO %B %t %a %r %si %o %k \\\"%R\\\" %s %e %b %y %m %n \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\" %v\")\r\n\r\nThis creates & returns a function, ``line_parser``, which accepts a line from an s3 log file in that format, and will \r\nreturn the parsed values in a dictionary.\r\n\r\nKey:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    %BO - bucket owner - The canonical user ID of the owner of the source bucket.\r\n    %B - bucket - The name of the bucket that the request was processed against. If the     system receives a malformed \r\n    request and cannot determine the bucket, the request will not appear in any server access log.\r\n    %t - date/time - The time at which the request was received. The format, using strftime() terminology, is \r\n    [%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z]\r\n    %a - remote ip - Remote IP-address The apparent Internet address of the requester. Intermediate proxies and \r\n    firewalls might obscure the actual address of the machine making the request.\r\n    %r - requester_id - The canonical user ID of the requester, or the string \"Anonymous\" for unauthenticated requests. \r\n    If the requester was an IAM user, this field will return the requester's IAM user name along with the AWS root \r\n    account that the IAM user belongs to. This identifier is the same one used for access control purposes.\r\n    %si - s3_request_id - The request ID is a string generated by Amazon S3 to uniquely identify each request.\r\n    %o - operation - The operation listed here is declared as SOAP.operation, REST.HTTP_method.resource_type, \r\n    WEBSITE.HTTP_method.resource_type, or BATCH.DELETE.OBJECT.\r\n    %k - key - The \"key\" part of the request, URL encoded, or \"-\" if the operation does not take a key parameter.\r\n    \\\"%R\\\" - request_firs_line - First line of request. The Request-URI part of the HTTP request message.\r\n    %s - status - The request method The numeric HTTP status code of the response.\r\n    %e - error - The Amazon S3 Error Code, or \"-\" if no error occurred.\r\n    %b - bytes - Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. The number of response bytes sent, excluding HTTP \r\n    protocol overhead, or \"-\" if zero.\r\n    %y - total_bytes - Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. In CLF format, i.e. a '-' rather than a 0 when \r\n    no bytes are sent. The total size of the object in question.\r\n    %m - total_time - The number of milliseconds the request was in flight from the server's perspective. This value is \r\n    measured from the time your request is received to the time that the last byte of the response is sent. Measurements \r\n    made from the client's perspective might be longer due to network latency.\r\n    %n - turnaround_time - The number of milliseconds that Amazon S3 spent processing your request. This value is \r\n    measured from the time the last byte of your request was received until the time the first byte of the response was \r\n    sent.\r\n    \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" - referer - The contents of Foobar: header line(s) in the request sent to the server. Changes made \r\n    by other modules (e.g. mod_headers) affect this. If you're interested in what the request header was prior to when \r\n    most modules would have modified it, use mod_setenvif to copy the header into an internal environment variable and \r\n    log that value with the %\\{VARNAME}e described above. The value of the HTTP Referrer header, if present. HTTP \r\n    user-agents (e.g. browsers) typically set this header to the URL of the linking or embedding page when making a \r\n    request.\r\n    \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\" - user agent - The value of the HTTP User-Agent header.\r\n    %v - version_id - The version ID in the request, or \"-\" if the operation does not take a versionId parameter.",
