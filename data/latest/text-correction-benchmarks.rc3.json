    "description": "# Text correction benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks and baselines for various text correction tasks. Light-weight and \neasy to use.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ad-freiburg/text-correction-benchmarks\ncd text-correction-benchmarks && pip install .\n```\n\nAfter installation you will have two commands available to you:\n- `tcb.evaluate` for evaluating model predictions on benchmarks\n- `tcb.baseline` for running baselines on benchmarks\n\n### Usage\n\nThis repository contains [benchmarks](benchmarks) for text correction tasks such as\n- Whitespace correction (**wsc**)\n- Spelling error correction (**sec**)\n- Word-level spelling error detection (**sedw**)\n- Sequence-level spelling error detection (**seds**)\n\nin the following simple text file format:\n- Whitespace correction\n  - *corrupt.txt*: Input text with whitespace errors (can also contains spelling errors, but they remain uncorrected in the groundtruth)\n  - *correct.txt*: Groundtruth text without whitespace errors\n  > \"Th isis a tset.\" > \"This is a tset.\"\n- Spelling error correction\n  - *corrupt.txt*: Input text with spelling errors (can also contain whitespace errors to make the task harder)\n  - *correct.txt*: Groundtruth text without whitespace and spelling errors\n  > \"Th isis a tset.\" > \"This is a test.\" \n- Word-level spelling error detection:\n  - *corrupt.txt*: Input text with spelling errors (should not contain whitespace errors, since we assume they are already fixed)\n  - *correct.txt*: Groundtruth label for each word in the input (split by whitespace), indicating whether a word contains a spelling error (1)\n  or not (0)\n  > \"This is a tset.\" > \"0 0 0 1\"\n- Sequence-level spelling error detection:\n  - *corrupt.txt*: Input text with spelling errors (can also contain whitespace errors)\n  - *correct.txt*: Groundtruth label for each sequence in the input, indicating whether the sequence contains a spelling error (1) or not (0)\n  > \"this is a tset.\" > \"1\"\n\nFor each format one line corresponds to one benchmark sample.\n\nNote that for some benchmarks we also provide versions other than [*test*](benchmarks/test), e.g. \n[*dev*](benchmarks/dev) or [*tuning*](benchmarks/tuning), which can be used to assess performance \nof your method during developement. Final evaluations should always be done on the *test* split.\n\nTo evaluate predictions on a benchmark using `tcb.evaluate`,\nthe following procedure is recommended:\n1. Run your model on `benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark>/corrupt.txt` \n2. Save your predictions in the expected format for the benchmark under\n   in `benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark>/predictions/<model_name>.txt`\n3. Evaluate your predictions on a benchmark using `tcb.evaluate`:\n   ```bash\n   # evaluate your predictions on the benchmark\n   tcb.evaluate -b benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark>\n\n   # optionally sort by some metric and highlight the best predictions\n   tcb.evaluate -b benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark> --sort \"<metric>\" --highlight\n   ```\n\nYou can also evaluate across multiple benchmarks like so:\n```bash\n# when evaluating across multiple benchmarks you always need to specify a metric,\n# otherwise you will get an error \n\n# listing multiple benchmarks\ntcb.evaluate -b benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark1> \\\n    benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<benchmark2> ... -m \"<metric>\"\n\n# using glob pattern\ntcb.evaluate -b benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<gl*ob_patte*rn> -m \"<metric>\"\n\n# you can highlight the best predictions per benchmark\ntcb.evaluate -b benchmarks/<split>/<task>/<gl*ob_patte*rn> -m \"<metric>\" --highlight\n```\n\nDepending on the task the following metrics are calculated:\n- Whitespace correction\n  - F1 (micro-averaged)\n  - F1 (sequence-averaged)\n  - Sequence accuracy\n- Spelling error correction\n  - F1 (micro-averaged)\n  - F1 (sequence-averaged)\n  - Sequence accuracy\n- Word-level spelling error detection\n  - Word accuracy\n  - Binary F1 (micro-averaged)\n- Sequence-level spelling error detection\n  - Binary F1\n  - Sequence accuracy\n\n### Baselines\n\nWe also provide baselines for each task:\n\n- Whitespace correction:\n    - Dummy (**wsc_dummy**)\n- Spelling error correction:\n    - Dummy (**sec_dummy**)\n    - Close to dictionary (**sec_ctd**)\n    - [Norvig](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) (**sec_norvig**)\n    - [Aspell](http://aspell.net) (**sec_aspell**)\n    - [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io) (**sec_hunspell**)\n    - [Jamspell](https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell) (**sec_jamspell**)\n    - [Neuspell (BERT)](https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell) (**sec_neuspell_bert**)\n- Word-level spelling error detection:\n    - Dummy (**sedw_dummy**)\n    - Out of dictionary (**sedw_ood**)\n    - From spelling error correction<sup>1</sup> (**sedw_from_sec**)\n- Sequence-level spelling error detection:\n    - Dummy (**seds_dummy**)\n    - Out of dictionary (**seds_ood**)\n    - From spelling error correction<sup>1</sup> (**seds_from_sec**)\n\nThe dummy baselines produce the predictions one gets by leaving the inputs unchanged.\n\n<sup>1</sup> We can reuse spelling error correction baselines to detect spelling errors both on\na word and sequence level. For the word level we simply predict that all words changed\nby a spelling corrector contain a spelling error. For the sequence level we\npredict that a sequence contains a spelling error if it is changed by a spelling corrector.\nAll spelling error correction baselines or prediction files\ncan be used as underlying spelling correctors for this purpose.\n\nYou can run a baseline using `tcb.baseline`:\n```bash\n# run baseline on stdin and output to stdout\ntcb.baseline <baseline_name>\n\n# run baseline on file and output to stdout\ntcb.baseline <baseline_name> -f <input_file>\n\n# run baseline on file and write predictions to file\ntcb.baseline <baseline_name> -f <input_file> -o <output_file>\n\n# some baselines require you to pass additional arguments,\n# you will get error messages if you dont\n# e.g. all dictionary based baselines like the out of dictionary baseline\n# for word-level spelling error detection need the path to a dictionary\n# as additional argument\ntcb.baseline sedw_ood -f <input_file> --dictionary <dictionary_file>\n```\n\nDictionaries can be found [here](dictionaries).\n\nPredictions of the baselines and other models from the literature \ncan be found in a subdirectory `predictions` in each benchmark,\nsee e.g. [here](benchmarks/test/wsc/arXiv.OCR/predictions).\n\n---\n\nThis repository is backed by the [text-correction-utils](https://github.com/bastiscode/text-correction-utils) package.\n",
