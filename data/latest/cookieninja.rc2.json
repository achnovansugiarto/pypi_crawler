We strive to bring the life back to the project. We would like the community to contribute to this fork.\nto make it as good as possible!\n\n## Installation\n`pip install cookieninja`\n## Features\n\n- Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux are officially supported.\n- You don't have to know/write Python code to use Cookiecutter.\n- Works with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9., 3.10\n- Project templates can be in any programming language or markup format:\n  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, CoffeeScript, RST, Markdown, CSS, HTML, you name it.\n  You can use multiple languages in the same project template.\n\n### For users of existing templates\n\n- Simple command line usage:\n\n  ```bash\n  # Create project from the cookieninja-pypackage.git repo template\n  # You'll be prompted to enter values.\n  # Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,\n  # based on those values.\n  $ cookieninja https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n  # For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix\n  $ cookieninja gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n  ```\n\n- Use it at the command line with a local template:\n\n  ```bash\n  # Create project in the current working directory, from the local\n  # cookieninja-pypackage/ template\n  $ cookieninja cookieninja-pypackage/\n  ```\n\n- Or use it from Python:\n\n  ```py\n  from cookieninja.main import cookiecutter\n\n  # Create project from the cookieninja-pypackage/ template\n  cookiecutter('cookieninja-pypackage/')\n\n  # Create project from the cookieninja-pypackage.git repo template\n  cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookieninja-pypackage.git')\n  ```\n\n- Unless you suppress it with `--no-input`, you are prompted for input:\n  - Prompts are the keys in `cookiecutter.json`.\n  - Default responses are the values in `cookiecutter.json`.\n  - Prompts are shown in order.\n- Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:\n\n  ```yaml\n  default_context:\n    full_name: \"Audrey Roy Greenfeld\"\n    email: \"audreyr@gmail.com\"\n    github_username: \"audreyfeldroy\"\n  cookiecutters_dir: \"~/.cookiecutters/\"\n  ```\n\n- Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.\n- If you have already cloned a cookiecutter into `~/.cookiecutters/`,  you can reference it by directory name:\n\n  ```bash\n  # Clone cookieninja-pypackage\n  $ cookieninja gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage\n  # Now you can use the already cloned cookieninja by name\n  $ cookieninja cookieninja-pypackage\n  ```\n\n- You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.\n- Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults  whenever you generate a project.\n- Inject extra context with command-line arguments:\n\n  ```bash\n  cookieninja --no-input gh:msabramo/cookiecutter-supervisor program_name=foobar startsecs=10\n  ```\n\n- Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for injection of extra context.\n- Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.\n- Projects generated to your current directory or to target directory if specified with `-o` option.\n\n### For template creators\n\n- Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.\n- 100% of templating is done with Jinja2.\n- Both, directory names and filenames can be templated.\n  For example:\n\n  ```py\n  {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py\n  ```\n- Simply define your template variables in a `cookiecutter.json` file.\n  For example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"full_name\": \"Audrey Roy Greenfeld\",\n    \"email\": \"audreyr@gmail.com\",\n    \"project_name\": \"Complexity\",\n    \"repo_name\": \"complexity\",\n    \"project_short_description\": \"Refreshingly simple static site generator.\",\n    \"release_date\": \"2013-07-10\",\n    \"year\": \"2013\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\"\n  }\n  ```\n- Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after generating a project.\n\n## Available Cookiecutters\n\nMaking great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors.\nWe're so pleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose from.\nWe hope you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.\n\n### A Pantry Full of Cookiecutters\n\nThe best place to start searching for specific and ready to use cookiecutter template is [Github search](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories).\nJust type `cookiecutter` and you will discover over 4000 related repositories.\n\nWe also recommend you to check related GitHub topics.\nFor general search use [cookiecutter-template](https://github.com/topics/cookiecutter-template).\nFor specific topics try to use `cookiecutter-yourtopic`, like `cookiecutter-python` or `cookiecutter-datascience`.\nThis is a new GitHub feature, so not all active repositories use it at the moment.\n\nIf you are template developer please add related [topics](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) with `cookiecutter` prefix to you repository.\nWe believe it will make it more discoverable.\nYou are almost not limited in topics amount, use it!\n\n### Cookiecutter Specials\n\nThese Cookiecutters are maintained by the cookiecutter team:\n\n- [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage):\n  ultimate Python package project template by [@audreyfeldroy's](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy).\n- [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django):\n  a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django projects quickly.\n  It is bleeding edge with Bootstrap 5, customizable users app, starter templates, working user registration, celery setup, and much more.\n- [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin):\n  Minimal Cookiecutter template for authoring [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) plugins that help you to write better programs.\n\n## Community\n\nThe core committer team can be found in [authors section](AUTHORS.md).\nWe are always welcome and invite you to participate.\n\nStuck? Try one of the following:\n\n- See the [Troubleshooting](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html) page.\n- Ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cookiecutter).\n- You are strongly encouraged to [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) about the problem.\n  Do it even if it's just \"I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter\" with a link to your cookiecutter.\n  Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.\n- Ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9BrxzPKuEW) if you must (but please try one of the other options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion).\n\nDevelopment on Cookiecutter is community-driven:\n\n- Huge thanks to all the [contributors](AUTHORS.md) who have pitched in to help make Cookiecutter an even better tool.\n- Everyone is invited to contribute.\n  Read the [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md), then get started.\n- Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9BrxzPKuEW)\n  (note: due to work and other commitments, a core committer might not always be available)\n\nEncouragement is unbelievably motivating.\nIf you want more work done on Cookiecutter, show support:\n\n- Thank a core committer for their efforts.\n- Star [Cookiecutter on GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).\n- [Support this project](#support-this-project)\n\nGot criticism or complaints?\n\n- [File an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) so that Cookiecutter can be improved.\n  Be friendly and constructive about what could be better.\n  Make detailed suggestions.\n- **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.**\n  For example, if you are discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on the email.\n- Be encouraging.\n  A comment like \"This function ought to be rewritten like this\" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like \"Eww, look how bad this function is.\"\n\nWaiting for a response to an issue/question?\n\n- Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through.\n  If urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.\n- Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.\n- Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.\n- Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait?\n  [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) is available for hire for consultation or custom development.\n\n## Support This Project\n\nThis project is run by volunteers.\nShortly we will be providing means for organizations and individuals to support the project.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone interacting in the Cookiecutter project's codebases and documentation is expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/).\nThis includes, but is not limited to, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists, and other virtual or in real life communication.\n\n## Creator / Leader\n\nThe original `cookiecutter` project was created and is led by [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy).\n\nThe fork was created and maintained by [Yuval Dolev](https://github.com/yuvaldolev) and [Lior Weissman](https://github.com/liortct).\n\n",
