    "description": "# dt-sms-api-sdk-python\n\nThis library is meant as an unofficial SDK (Software Development Kit) for the [Deutsche Telekom Developer SMS API](https://developer.telekom.com/products/sms-api/summary) and to give Python developers a quick start to use it withing their code.\n\nPlease read the instructions on Deutsche Telekom Developer Portal and set up your account there to get the needed credentials. To use the SDK, you may install it with pip:\n\n```\npip install unofficial-dt-sms-api-sdk\n```\n\n## SMS - (Short Message Service)\n\nSMS is a base functionality in GSM conform mobile communication. While it was designed to send a short text message of 160 characters from one cellular to another it got some upgrades and special features. The most important you need to know for proper usage of the API is, that nowadays you can send longer text messages and even use special characters like Emojis. But internally that will be split into multiple SMS messages with reduced text capacity - and as a consumer of the API you will have to pay for each of those split part messages, even if in-front of the receiver it is presented just as one message.\n\n### Pricing\n\nHow do you know the price of a Message to be sent?\n\n#### \"num_segments\"\n\nSo the important question for your balance is - how many part messages your account get billed for a message. If you want to understand the splitting you can (interactively) learn it on https://charactercounter.com/sms or use the following helper method:\n\n```\nfrom dt_sms_sdk.message import Message\n\nMessage.gsm_split_count(\"My message to be sent\")  # will return 1 for this string\n```\n\nAlternatively you could also generate a full Message object\n```\nm = Message(sender=\"+491755555555\", recipient=\"+491755555556\", body=\"My message to be sent\")\nm.number_of_segments() # will return 1 for this string\n```\n\n#### \"gross_price\"\n\nNow you know, the amount of SMS which will be sent, you need to know the price. Currently, the price is only available on the website https://developer.telekom.com/api/v1/prices\n\nBut the SDK will provide you two methods to get an (maybe outdated) offline price list or download the current only one as a list:\n```\nfrom dt_sms_sdk.pricing import Pricing\nPricing.default()\nPricing.download()\n```\n\nBoth list are just the row data, but by instantiating a Pricing object with one of them, you get some controll over it:\n\n```\np = Pricing()  # this is directly loading the offline\np = Pricing(Pricing.download())\n\np.gross_price_by_iso2(\"DE\")  # gives you the price including vat for Germany\n```\n\n#### \"iso2\"\n\nBefore starting a deep dive into telephone number plans, just be aware, that some country calling codes are shared by multiple countries e.g. +1 is used by the USA and Canada (and many more). But in the DT pricing list both countries have different prices (e.g. € 0.0058 vs. € 0.0094 Price excl. VAT on December the 31st 2022).\n\nSo how do you know which country are you sending the SMS? Maybe you did not recognized the E164PhoneNumber class above while creating the Message object. The Message class will try to create such an object with the sender string parameter but have to for the recipient parameter - otherwise a ValueError is raised.\nAn E164PhoneNumber object can evaluate the ISO2 code of the given number.\n\n```\nfrom dt_sms_sdk.phone_number import E164PhoneNumber\n\nn = E164PhoneNumber(\"+491755555555\")\nn.iso2  # will return \"DE\" \n```\n\nUsing the Message object you can access this information from the _to parameter from the message recipient attribute:\n\n```\nm = Message(\"+491755555555\", \"+491755555556\", \"My message to be sent\")\nm.recipient.iso2  # will return \"DE\" \n```\n\n#### \"message_gross_price\"\n\nWith the information about the gross price for a message and in how many parts that will be split you could calculate the price ... or get it done by Pricing:\n\n```\nm = Message(\"+491755555555\", \"+491755555556\", \"My message to be sent\")\n\np = Pricing()  # this will use the offline price list within the SDK, to use the current online one, see above.\np.message_gross_price(m)  # will return the total gross price for the message (all of its splits to the designated country). \n```\n\nIf the message is not valid or no price data was loaded for the intended country, the returned price will be a Decimal(\"NaN\").\n\n#### \"messages_gross_price\"\n\nAnd what if you want to get the price for multiple message, there is also a method for it:\n\n```\np.messages_gross_price([m1, m2, m3]) # if any of m1, m2 or m3 would lead to a Decimal(\"NaN\") price, it will be ignored for the sum\n```\n\nWhile one or more of those message might have a \"NotANumber\" price value (see above), by default those messages are ignored and only valid prices are summed up.\n\nBut you may change the behavior by providing an additional parameter, to change the behavior to: if at least one price is \"NotANumber\" the whole sum is \"NotANumber\":\n\n```\np.messages_gross_price([m1, m2, m3], True)  # if any of m1, m2 or m3 would lead to a Decimal(\"NaN\") price, the whole result will be Decimal(\"NaN\")\n```\n\n### Invoking\n\nNow that you know the price, you can risk to send the message. All API communication is encapsulated by the SMSAPIClient class in sms_api.py, which needs to be instanced with your API-Key.\n\n```\nfrom dt_sms_sdk.sms_api import SMSAPIClient\n\nc = SMSAPIClient(api_key=\"YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY\")\n```\n\n#### Send\n\nThe next step is to use this SMSAPIClient object and give it the message to send:\n\n```\nresponse = c.send(message=m)\n```\n\nBe aware, that multiple exceptions can happen while trying to send an SMS. In general they are from the type SMSAPIError and specified with descended types. So please invoke that method with a try block!\n\n#### Status\n\nThe response of the send method above will return an object of the class SMSAPIResponse, which includes a direct status of the invocation and the sid of the request, to query the status later on to see when/if the SMS got delivered. Just invoke the status method with the sid (or for easiness with the response itself - the method will take the sid itself ) and you will get a new SMSAPIResponse object for that Message.\n\n```\nupdated_response = c.status(response)\nupdated_response.status  # status is from the Enum class SMSAPIMessageStatus\n```\n\n## Dashboard Account\n\nWhile this SDK concentrates on the SMS API, it would be quite helpful to have access to information DT is only providing in its Developer Portal Dashboard after a login.\n\n### Account\n\n#### Login\n\nInstantiating an Account object needs to provide the credentials (username & password) of the Account on the DT Developer Portal Dashboard:\n\n```\nfrom dt_sms_sdk.account import Account\n\na = Account(username=\"emil@mail.com\", password=\"SuperSecretPassword\")\n```\n\nThis directly will make an online request for a login, which will return an access token, which the object stores for further request. If you do not want that while initializing the object, you can specify this by the optional parameter auto_login:\n\n```\na = Account(username=\"emil@mail.com\", password=\"SuperSecretPassword\", auto_login=False)\n```\n\nThe first request which needs the authentication token will trigger the login then.\n\nWhile the Dashboard offers to register & validate an account, edit account properties or initiate retrieve password process, those operations are not supported by this basic Account implementation.\n\n#### API-Key\n\nThe first information, which we need to run the SMSAPIClient, is the API-Key. In the code above this has been copied into the code as a string, but with the account object we can download it from the Dashboard:\n```\nc = SMSAPIClient(api_key=a.api_key())\n```\n\nTo shorten the code, the account object can directly instanciate an SMS Client and give this back from one message call:\n```\nc = a.sms_api_client()\n```\n\nWhile the Dashboard offers a method to generate a new api key, this operation is not supported by this basic Account implementation.\n\n#### Registered Phone Number(s)\n\nOn the Dashboard you as the developer need to register and verify phone numbers which you want to use as the sender number of the SMS.\n\nWhile both operations will not be supported by this basic Account implementation and have to be done on the portal (once), the main point of using one number does not need to be done hard coded. You can read the verified phone numbers for the SMS API of an account as a list of E164PhoneNumber(s):\n\n```\nphone_numbers = a.phone_numbers_for_sms_sender()\n```\n\n#### Wallet\n\nWhile the whole README started with the question of much sending a Message over the SMS API would cost, we know come to the question of how much money is left on your prepaid balance to conclude if you can offer to send it. \n\nA use case could be: you want to send multiple messages, but only all or none. So you can first calculate the total cost of all Messages and then check if your balance is sufficient and only then start sending. An Account object offers a method to return the Wallet object with the downloaded wallet data of that account:\n\n```\nw = a.wallet()\nw.balance  # that is a Decimal\nw.currency  # currently that is just Currency.EURO\n```\n\nFinally, as a simple implementation Account would not support the Dashboard functionality to 'Buy Credit' / re-charge the wallet - sorry!\n\nNevertheless, the SDK should give you a quick start with the DT SMS API - Have some fun with it!\n",
