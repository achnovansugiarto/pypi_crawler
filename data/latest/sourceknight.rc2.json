    "description": "# sourceknight\n\nA simple dependency manager and build system for sourcemod projects\n\n## Overview\n\n`sourceknight` was created to simplify the process of building and developing sourcemod plugins. It lets you specify dependencies in a configuration file so they can be automatically updated, and manages the sourcemod build tree for you.\n\nRight now, `sourceknight` is essentially a proof of concept -- it is only capable of building some simple projects on Linux hosts. It can acquire and unpack dependencies from git repos or tar archives and run `spcomp`. Additional functionality will be implemented as needed (or maybe requested).\n\n## Building and installing\n\nYou can now install `sourceknight` from pypi: `pip install sourceknight`.\n\nAlternatively, compile and install from source: `pip install .`.\n\n## Defining a project\n\nThe core concept of `sourceknight` is the *project*, which encapsulates any plugins you're trying to build and their dependencies (including sourcemod itself).\n\nA *project directory* will include a *project file* called `sourceknight.yaml` that defines all the parameters of your project, including its name,\nits dependencies, and the plugins it will build. The project file is written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).\n\nIf building your own plugin, your project directory will likely also include any sourcepawn files you need, but this is optional --\nyou can also also use `sourcepawn` just to simplify compiling a collection of third party plugins by declaring them as dependencies.\n\nA minimal `sourceknight.yaml` might look something like this:\n\n```yaml\nproject:\n  name: myplugin-example\n  sourceknight: 0.2\n  dependencies:\n    - name: sourcemod\n      type: tar\n      version: 1.10.0-git6503\n      location: https://sm.alliedmods.net/smdrop/1.10/sourcemod-1.10.0-git6503-linux.tar.gz\n      unpack:\n      - source: /addons\n        dest: /addons\n  root: /\n  targets:\n    - myplugin\n```\n\nHere, we're just telling `sourceknight` where to download `sourcemod` itself, and specifying that we want to build `myplugin`.\n\nDetails about the individual sections of the project file follow.\n\n### Metadata\n\nThe `name` key specifies the name of your project. (Technically, it isn't even required to be specified right now, but that might change.)\n\nThe `sourceknight` key specifies the version of sourceknight this package was designed for. This allows users to be warned if they need to update.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nDependencies describe any external code, including external plugins you want to build, include files you need, and even `sourcemod` itself. You will likely need to specify the `sourcemod` dependency for every project because it provides the compiler for sourcepawn code (`spcomp`) as well as several essential headers.\n\nThe most important keys in your dependency declarations are its `name`, its `type`, and `unpack` instructions. Each dependency must have a unique `name`. The `type` tells `sourceknight` how to acquire the dependency.\n\nDepending on the `type`, different additional fields may be required. Right now, only two `type`s are supported: `git` and `tar`, which refer to git repositories and tar archives, respectively.\n\n**`tar`:**\n\n- `location`: URL to download the tar file from\n- Optional: `version`, which can be manually specified to help prevent re-downloading the same file unnecessarily\n\n**`git`:**\n\n- `repo`: Git repository URL to clone\n\nBoth of these types of dependencies must have an `unpack` block, which tells us which files to copy out of them and where they belong relative to the `sourceknight` *build root*. The build root is a hidden directory maintained by `sourceknight` which will contain the entire sourcemod tree (i.e., it will contain the `addons` directory) as well as any other dependencies and sources specified by your project.\n\nIn the example above, the `unpack` declaration for `sourcemod` says to unpack the `/addons` directory to `/addons`. In sourcemod's case, this means we're copying the entire contents of the archive. However, the [extended example project file](example/sourceknight.yaml) includes other examples of unpack declarations. Note that the destination of an unpack operation is always relative to the build tree. Multiple `source`, `dest` pairs can be specified in the `unpack` section if needed.\n\n### Build specification\n\nThe last part of the example specifies how to build the project.\n\nThe `root` key tells `sourceknight` where in the project directory your source tree originates. That is, a sourcemod project will typically have a structure containing `/addons/sourcemod/scripting/` -- in this case `root` will refer to the directory that contains `addons`, relative to your project directory. Note that your project does not need to specify a `root` if you aren't compiling any sources of your own (i.e., you're only compiling external plugins you specified as dependencies).\n\nThe `targets` list contains all the plugins you want built, whether from dependencies or your own sources. Each of these should have a corresponding `.sp` file in the `/addons/sourcemod/scripting` directory and will result in a `.smx` file being generated.\n\nYou can optionally specify two additional keys that tell `sourceknight` how to compile your project: `compiler` to override the default location of `spcomp`, and `workdir` to define the working directory for compilation (both relative to the build root).\n\n## Building your project\n\nThe easy way to get `sourceknight` to build your project is to simply go to your project directory and run the `build` command:\n\n```bash\nexample$ sourceknight build\nUpdating...\nUpdating: sourcemod\n Downloading https://sm.alliedmods.net/smdrop/1.10/sourcemod-1.10.0-git6503-linux.tar.gz...\nUpdating: sourcecolors\n Cloning from https://github.com/Ilusion9/sourcecolors-inc-sm\nUpdating: extend-map\n Cloning from https://github.com/Ilusion9/extend-map-sm\nUnpacking...\nUnpacking sourcemod...\n Unpacking archive...\n Extracting addons to addons\nUnpacking sourcecolors...\n Extracting include to addons/sourcemod/scripting/include\nUnpacking extend-map...\n Extracting scripting to addons/sourcemod/scripting\nCompiling...\nCopying sources...\nBuilding extendmap...\n ...\nBuilding example...\n ...\n```\n\nThe `build` command, when run from your project directory, will automatically perform all the steps needed to build your plugins, and the `.smx` files will be output there (i.e., to the working directory). If you want to put the compiled plugins somewhere else, you can pass the `-o` option:\n\n```\nexample$ sourceknight build -o compiled\n```\n\nIf you don't want to run `sourceknight` from your project directory every time, you can specify `-p` to provide the path to it:\n\n```bash\nsourceknight$ sourceknight -p example build\n```\n\nThe `-p` option is applicable to every `sourceknight` subcommand, and must be specified before it.\n\nBehind the scenes, `build` is running three independent steps: `update`, `unpack`, and `compile`. The `update` step downloads and caches dependencies, `unpack` extracts them into the build directory, and `compile` compiles the plugins.\n\nThere is also a `status` command, which provides useful information about the version of dependencies which are cached and unpacked:\n\n```bash\nexample$ sourceknight status\nsourcemod\n Cached version: 1.10.0-git6503\n Unpacked version: 1.10.0-git6503\nsourcecolors\n Cached version: d7b112be7c2a88a3d7b5b124017c102ce320dee3\n Unpacked version: d7b112be7c2a88a3d7b5b124017c102ce320dee3\nextend-map\n Cached version: 5c3d88be409f9c826bf7a84f319c826eaef5ceb5\n Unpacked version: 5c3d88be409f9c826bf7a84f319c826eaef5ceb5\n```\n\nIf you want to learn more, all of the `sourceknight` subcommands have additional information available with the `-h` flag:\n\n```bash\n$ sourceknight unpack -h\nusage: sourceknight unpack [-h] [-a,--all] [-c,--clean]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -a,--all    Force unpacking all dependencies, even if they have not been updated\n  -c,--clean  Force creating a new unpack directory, even if one already exists\n```\n\n## sourceknight state\n\n`sourceknight` will create a directory called `.sourceknight` in your project directory. All the cached dependencies and the build directory are located within it. If you want to clean up after yourself, or if something goes horribly wrong, delete `.sourceknight`.\n\n## License \n\nThis project is made available under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n",
