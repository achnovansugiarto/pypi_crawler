It runs under Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.\n\nPlease see http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/ for the\ndocumentation.\n\nSee https://github.com/collective/deform for in-development version.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nThis is a fork and can be maintained by the ``collective``. \n\nNew versions or releases to PyPI will be made under the name \"deform2000\".\n\n\n2.0.1 (2016-06-02)\n------------------\n\n- First register wasn't working.\n\n- Adding comment about this fork.\n\n\n2.0 (2016-06-02)\n----------------\n\n- Selectively add setuptools_git as a setup_requires #273.\n\n- Updated bootstrap to 3.3.6.\n\n- Fix dateparts.pt and datetimeinput.pt for changes in bootstrap v3.0.3.\n  (The culprit is boostrap commit\n  `853b69f <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/853b69f2d>`_.)\n\n- Make ``dateinput`` work again by using the fixed name \"date\" as expected\n  by the pstruct schema.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/221.\n\n- Changed ``ISO8601_REGEX`` import to match change in colander\n\n- Add support for Python 3.4, PyPy3.\n\n- Raise ``Invalid`` rather than other errors when deserializing broken\n  or malicious pstructs with invalid types.  See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/203\n\n- Readd a time widget.\n\n- Fix a bug in the DateInputWidget.  See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/192.\n\n- Ensured that ``None`` would not show up as a css class name in rendered\n  template output.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/191\n\n  we now use dashed-names (e.g. ``deform-seq``).  A full list of changes is\n  below::\n\n    Old                               New\n\n    deformClosebutton                 deform-closebutton\n    deformFileupload                  deform-file-upload\n    deformFormFieldset                deform-form-fieldset\n    deformInsertBefore                deform-insert-before\n    deformOrderbutton                 deform-orderbutton\n    deformProto                       deform-proto\n    deformReplaces                    deform-replaces\n    deformSeq                         deform-seq\n    deformSeqAdd                      deform-seq-add\n    deformSeqContainer                deform-seq-container\n    deformSeqItem                     deform-seq-item\n    deformSet-item                    deform-set-item\n    errorMsg                          error-msg\n    errorMsgLbl                       error-msg-lbl\n\n- Fixed handling of buttons in nested sequences.\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/197\n\n2.0a2 (2013-10-18)\n------------------\n\n- ``PasswordWidget`` and ``CheckedPasswordWidget`` have grown an additional\n  argument/attribute named ``redisplay``, which controls what happens on a\n  validation failure of a form involving such a field.  If ``redisplay`` is\n  ``True`` (the default), the password will be re-rendered into the form when\n  the form is re-rendered after validation failure.  If ``redisplay`` is\n  ``False``, the password will not be re-rendered into the form.  The default\n  is ``False``, which means that, as of this release, passwords will not\n  be redisplayed; this changes the default behavior wrt previous releases.\n  Values typed into password fields are not redisplayed by default during\n  validation failure, as a security measure (the value winds up in browser\n  history).  Use ``PasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` or\n  ``CheckedPasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` to make these widgets redisplay\n  passwords on validation failures, matching the old behavior.\n\n- When using the default Chameleon template renderer, template names can now \n  be \"asset specifications\" e.g. ``mypackage:subdir1/subdir2/mytemplate.pt``\n  instead of extensionless paths relative to a search path.  When\n  template names are specified as asset specifications, the \n  ``pkg_resources.resource_filename`` API is used to dereference them\n  into an actual file path.\n\n2.0a1 (2013-10-05)\n------------------\n\nThis is an alpha release of Deform v2.  Deform v2 is backwards incompatible\nwith Deform v1.  It requires the use of Twitter Bootstrap v3, whereas \ndeform v1 did not require Bootstrap.\n\nA demonstration site that shows Deform 2 in action exists at \nhttp://deform2demo.repoze.org.\n\nBoth Deform 1 and Deform 2 will be maintained going forward.  If you wish\nto continue using Deform 1, because you cannot upgrade, or cannot depend on\nBootstrap 3, please pin your deform distribution requirement to\nsomething below 2.0a1, e.g. ``deform<=1.999``.\n\nThis first alpha release is missing formal documentation updates.  Apologies, \nwe needed to get a release out onto PyPI, as not having one is holding back\nthe development of a number of platforms and applications that depend on the \nchanges in v2+.  Documentation updates will be forthcoming over the lifetime \nof future alpha/beta releases.  However, below is a list of known issues that \nneed to be addressed to make a final release of Deform 2, as well as \ninformation about new features, and migration notes.  You may also be\nable to make use of the demo site at http://deform2demo.repoze.org to divine\nhow things have changed, and what CSS and JavaScript resources you'll need\nto include in your pages to make use of this release.\n\nTODO\n\n- docs\n- decide how to explain form.css (include in requirements or?)\n- horizontal/inline forms + structural things\n- assets for templates: deform should provide a tool to resolve that?\n- placeholder support for all textual inputs (and required/maxlength\n  see also https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116)\n- display help-blocks for readonly fields?\n- maybe readonly should be a property of the schema, not the widget.\n- consider whether \"style\"/\"css_class\" on multi-input widgets should apply to\n  a container or each element.\n- audit use of e.g. string:${css_class} so we don't see unexpected class=\"None\"\n  in widget rendering output.\n- some sort of test for mapping_item input_prepend/input_append\n- Currently description shows up as both tooltip of label and as help-block.\n  Maybe make these two things separate or at least don't show them both using\n  the same value.\n- normalize CSS class names to deform-foo rather than deformFoo\n- sequence_of_sequences: js that processes close/order buttons has to \n  be less promiscuous (it uses e.g. \"find\"); symptom: buttons\n  appear/disappear, act on the wrong element, etc... ugh 2013/10/05\n  cannot replicate, but still believe there may be an issue, but\n  maybe iElectric fixed it\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n- structural widget (mapping_item.pt) - do we need that or not or what? + \n  add a demo\n- prepend/append t.bootstrap stuff\n- https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116#issuecomment-23210460\n- group demos by widget type\n- handle ajax demo more UX friendly\n- Put drag handles in panel headers: https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/180\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n\n- input_prepend/input_append in mapping_item widget.\n- field.parent\n- field.get_root\n- inline attr of checkboxchoice and radiochoice widgets (see\n  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/182)\n- http://deform2demo.repoze.org/\n\nMIGRATION NOTES: \n\n- removed deprecated `height, width, skin, theme` parameters from RichTextWidget\n  (use \"options\" instead)\n- removed deprecated `render_initial_item` from SequenceWidget\n- removed deprecated deform.Set (use colander.Set instead)\n- DateInputWidget renamed parameter `dateFormat` to `format` (dateFormat\n  now unsupported).\n- DateTimeInputWidget now renders as two fields: one for a date and one\n  for a time, using pickadate.\n- We no longer bother trying to use the native datetimeinput widget on any\n  browser, because the support is so spotty.\n- DateTimeInputWidget takes two options now: date_options and time_options\n  instead of a single options dictionary.  The options are pickadate\n  date/time options respectively.\n- It is no longer possible to do DateTimeWidget().options['a'] = 'foo'\n  or DateTimeWidget().date_options['a'] = 'foo'.  If you need to change\n  options imperatively, set the entire .options/.date_options dictionary.\n- merged TypeaheadInputWidget to AutocompleteInputWidget (removed delay \n  parameter)\n- AutocompleteInputWidget now accepts string type for \"values\"\n- widgets no longer accepts \"size\" (instead use style=\"width: x\"), except\n  SelectWidget (it means the size of the dropdown)\n- get_widget_resources now returns asset specifications rather than\n  deform-static-relative paths\n- deform 2.0 requires users to manually load TB 3.0 and jquery 2.0\n- required labels no longer insert an asterisk inside a <span class=\"req\">\n  inside themselves.  instead the label element has a required class\n  if the field is required; use form.css to display this as an asterisk.\n- min_length of AutocompleteInputWidget now defaults to 1 (was 2)",
