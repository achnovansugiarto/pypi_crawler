    "description": "# Quick IT Management Tools\n\nThis is a set of lightweight IT management tools meant for small organizations and homelabs.  It is meant to fall somewhere between the capabilities of bash scripts and ansible.\n\nThe tools automate a handful of operations which I found myself having to repeatedly perform, but didn't have straightforward means of automation without jumping into much heavier and more complex solutions. The project is set up to provide a comfortable command line interface for manual and scripted use, while also being a fully usable Python 3 library.  \n\n## Features\n\nI add these features as I have need of them, but suggestions and contributions are welcome:\n\n(All are in progress)\n\n* Certificate checking and deployment\n* Local hosts file management\n* Local DNS static entry management\n* Vyos wireguard management\n\n## Debugging\n\n```bash\npip install --editable .\n```\n\n## Development Information\n\n### Startup\n\nFrom the command line, all persisted state is accessed through a singleton of the `Environment` class.  This is retrieved from the `Environment.default()` method.\n\nDuring the first call to `Environment.default()` the environment is constructed. The configuration for the `Environment` object is provided by the `QuickConfig` class.  This in turn is constructed through the `QuickConfig.default()` static method, which attempts to load a configuration file from the default application configuration directory provided by `click`.\n\n#### Object Construction\n\n*These mechanisms are messy and need to be streamlined once I have a better idea of all the things they need to do.*\n\nObjects which provide functionality are constructed dynamically at runtime from stored configuration. The `Environment` object has a field called `builders` which is a simple dataclass that has two `IBuilder` objects, one for building context objects, and one for building key stores.  \n\nAn `IBuilder` instantiates objects at the request of callers.  Types which the builder can produce must be registered using the `register` method, which takes the name The default implementation of an `IBuilder` is the `GenericBuilder` (these might be able to be squashed into one later). \n\nRegistering a type with the builder involves giving it a friendly string name for the type (this is the human-readable name used in configuration files), the type of the object to be built, and the type of the configuration object. Types which are built by a builder must have a class initializer which accepts an instance of the configuration object as the first argument.\n\nConfigurations for objects are stored in the form of json/yaml dictionaries having three elements: (1) a string `name`, (2) a string `type` which matches a string type name registered with the appropriate builder, and (3) a `config` dictionary that will be passed into the initializer of the configuration object.  When something is going to be built, these three things are put into an `EntityConfig` object which then gets given to the builder's `build` method.  It will first instantiate the configuration type using *dacite*'s `from_dict` method on the `config` dictionary.  Then it will instantiate the final object by passing this configuration object into the initializer for that class.\n\nAll of this is basically a complicated way of managing dynamic configurations.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHosts are one of the main entities. A host represents a computer or something that acts like a computer.  It has the following properties:\n\n* A unique name\n* A text description\n* A list of client management mechanisms (ssh, api, etc)\n* A set of type based configurations\n",
