We convert on-the-fly to Notion's internal formatted text data structure.\npage.title = \"The title has now changed, and has *live-updated* in the browser!\"\n```\n\n## Concepts and notes\n\n- We map tables in the Notion database into Python classes (subclassing `Record`), with each instance of a class representing a particular record. Some fields from the records (like `title` in the example above) have been mapped to model properties, allowing for easy, instantaneous read/write of the record. Other fields can be read with the `get` method, and written with the `set` method, but then you'll need to make sure to match the internal structures exactly.\n- The tables we currently support are **block** (via [`Block` class and its subclasses](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/c65c9b14ed5dcd6d9326264f2e888ab343d2b831/notion/block.py#L143), corresponding to different `type` of blocks), **space** (via [`Space` class](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/c65c9b14ed5dcd6d9326264f2e888ab343d2b831/notion/space.py#L6)), **collection** (via [`Collection` class](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/c65c9b14ed5dcd6d9326264f2e888ab343d2b831/notion/collection.py#L91)), **collection_view** (via [`CollectionView` and subclasses](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/c65c9b14ed5dcd6d9326264f2e888ab343d2b831/notion/collection.py#L175)), and **notion_user** (via [`User` class](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/master/notion/user.py)).\n- Data for all tables are stored in a central [`RecordStore`](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/c65c9b14ed5dcd6d9326264f2e888ab343d2b831/notion/store.py#L69), with the `Record` instances not storing state internally, but always referring to the data in the central `RecordStore`. Many API operations return updating versions of a large number of associated records, which we use to update the store, so the data in `Record` instances may sometimes update without being explicitly requested. You can also call the `refresh` method on a `Record` to trigger an update, or pass `force_update` to methods like `get`.\n- The API doesn't have strong validation of most data, so be careful to maintain the structures Notion is expecting. You can view the full internal structure of a record by calling `myrecord.get()` with no arguments.\n- When you call `client.get_block`, you can pass in either an ID, or the URL of a page. Note that pages themselves are just `blocks`, as are all the chunks of content on the page. You can get the URL for a block within a page by clicking \"Copy Link\" in the context menu for the block, and pass that URL into `get_block` as well.\n\n## Updating records\n\nWe keep a local cache of all data that passes through. When you reference an attribute on a `Record`, we first look to that cache to retrieve the value. If it doesn't find it, it retrieves it from the server. You can also manually refresh the data for a `Record` by calling the `refresh` method on it. By default (unless we instantiate `NotionClient` with `monitor=False`), we also [subscribe to long-polling updates](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/master/notion/monitor.py) for any instantiated `Record`, so the local cache data for these `Records` should be automatically live-updated shortly after any data changes on the server. The long-polling happens in a background daemon thread.\n\n## Example: Traversing the block tree\n\n```Python\nfor child in page.children:\n    print(child.title)\n\nprint(\"Parent of {} is {}\".format(page.id, page.parent.id))\n```\n\n## Example: Adding a new node\n\n```Python\nfrom notion.block import TodoBlock\n\nnewchild = page.children.add_new(TodoBlock, title=\"Something to get done\")\nnewchild.checked = True\n```\n\n## Example: Deleting nodes\n\n```Python\n# soft-delete\npage.remove()\n\n# hard-delete\npage.remove(permanently=True)\n```\n\n## Example: Create an embedded content type (iframe, video, etc)\n\n```Python\nfrom notion.block import VideoBlock\n\nvideo = page.children.add_new(VideoBlock, width=200)\n# sets \"property.source\" to the URL, and \"format.display_source\" to the embedly-converted URL\nvideo.set_source_url(\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0\")\n```\n\n## Example: Create a new embedded collection view block\n\n```Python\ncollection = client.get_collection(COLLECTION_ID) # get an existing collection\ncvb = page.children.add_new(CollectionViewBlock, collection=collection)\nview = cvb.views.add_new(view_type=\"table\")\n\n# Before the view can be browsed in Notion, \n# the filters and format options on the view should be set as desired.\n# \n# for example:\n#   view.set(\"query\", ...)\n#   view.set(\"format.board_groups\", ...)\n#   view.set(\"format.board_properties\", ...)\n```\n\n## Example: Moving blocks around\n\n```Python\n# move my block to after the video\nmy_block.move_to(video, \"after\")\n\n# move my block to the end of otherblock's children\nmy_block.move_to(otherblock, \"last-child\")\n\n# (you can also use \"before\" and \"first-child\")\n```\n\n## Example: Subscribing to updates\n\n*(Note: Notion->Python automatic updating is currently broken and hence disabled by default; call `my_block.refresh()` to update, in the meantime, while monitoring is being fixed)*\n\nWe can \"watch\" a `Record` so that we get a [callback](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/master/notion/store.py) whenever it changes. Combined with the live-updating of records based on long-polling, this allows for a \"reactive\" design, where actions in our local application can be triggered in response to interactions with the Notion interface.\n\n```Python\n\n# define a callback (note: all arguments are optional, just include the ones you care about)\ndef my_callback(record, difference):\n    print(\"The record's title is now:\" record.title)\n    print(\"Here's what was changed:\")\n    print(difference)\n\n# move my block to after the video\nmy_block.add_callback(my_callback)\n```\n\n## Example: Working with databases, aka \"collections\" (tables, boards, etc)\n\nHere's how things fit together:\n- Main container block: `CollectionViewBlock` (inline) / `CollectionViewPageBlock` (full-page)\n    - `Collection` (holds the schema, and is parent to the database rows themselves)\n        - `CollectionRowBlock`\n        - `CollectionRowBlock`\n        - ... (more database records)\n    - `CollectionView` (holds filters/sort/etc about each specific view)\n\nNote: For convenience, we automatically map the database \"columns\" (aka properties), based on the schema defined in the `Collection`, into getter/setter attributes on the `CollectionRowBlock` instances. The attribute name is a \"slugified\" version of the name of the column. So if you have a column named \"Estimated value\", you can read and write it via `myrowblock.estimated_value`. Some basic validation may be conducted, and it will be converted into the appropriate internal format. For columns of type \"Person\", we expect a `User` instance, or a list of them, and for a \"Relation\" we expect a singular/list of instances of a subclass of `Block`.\n\n```Python\n# Access a database using the URL of the database page or the inline block\ncv = client.get_collection_view(\"https://www.notion.so/myorg/8511b9fc522249f79b90768b832599cc?v=8dee2a54f6b64cb296c83328adba78e1\")\n\n# List all the records with \"Bob\" in them\nfor row in cv.collection.get_rows(search=\"Bob\"):\n    print(\"We estimate the value of '{}' at {}\".format(row.name, row.estimated_value))\n\n# Add a new record\nrow = cv.collection.add_row()\nrow.name = \"Just some data\"\nrow.is_confirmed = True\nrow.estimated_value = 399\nrow.files = [\"https://www.birdlife.org/sites/default/files/styles/1600/public/slide.jpg\"]\nrow.person = client.current_user\nrow.tags = [\"A\", \"C\"]\nrow.where_to = \"https://learningequality.org\"\n\n# Run a filtered/sorted query using a view's default parameters\nresult = cv.default_query().execute()\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n\n# Run an \"aggregation\" query\naggregations = [{\n    \"property\": \"estimated_value\",\n    \"aggregator\": \"sum\",\n    \"id\": \"total_value\",\n}]\nresult = cv.build_query(aggregate=aggregate_params).execute()\nprint(\"Total estimated value:\", result.get_aggregate(\"total_value\"))\n\n# Run a \"filtered\" query (inspect network tab in browser for examples, on queryCollection calls)\nfilter_params = {\n    \"filters\": [{\n        \"filter\": {\n            \"value\": {\n                \"type\": \"exact\",\n                \"value\": {\"table\": \"notion_user\", \"id\": client.current_user.id}\n            },\n            \"operator\": \"person_contains\"\n        },\n        \"property\": \"assigned_to\"\n    }],\n    \"operator\": \"and\"\n}\nresult = cv.build_query(filter=filter_params).execute()\nprint(\"Things assigned to me:\", result)\n\n# Run a \"sorted\" query\nsort_params = [{\n    \"direction\": \"descending\",\n    \"property\": \"estimated_value\",\n}]\nresult = cv.build_query(sort=sort_params).execute()\nprint(\"Sorted results, showing most valuable first:\", result)\n```\n\nNote: You can combine `filter`, `aggregate`, and `sort`. See more examples of queries by setting up complex views in Notion, and then inspecting the full query: `cv.get(\"query2\")`.\n\nYou can also see [more examples in action in the smoke test runner](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/blob/master/notion/smoke_test.py). Run it using:\n\n```sh\npython run_smoke_test.py --page [YOUR_NOTION_PAGE_URL] --token [YOUR_NOTION_TOKEN_V2]\n```\n\n## Example: Lock/Unlock A Page\n```Python\nfrom notion.client import NotionClient\n\n# Obtain the `token_v2` value by inspecting your browser cookies on a logged-in session on Notion.so\nclient = NotionClient(token_v2=\"<token_v2>\")\n\n# Replace this URL with the URL of the page or database you want to edit\npage = client.get_block(\"https://www.notion.so/myorg/Test-c0d20a71c0944985ae96e661ccc99821\")\n\n# The \"locked\" property is available on PageBlock and CollectionViewBlock objects\n# Set it to True to lock the page/database\npage.locked = True\n# and False to unlock it again\npage.locked = False\n```\n\n## Example: Set the current user for multi-account user\n\n```python\nfrom notion.client import NotionClient\nclient = NotionClient(token_v2=\"<token_v2>\")\n\n# The initial current_user of a multi-account user may be an unwanted user\nprint(client.current_user.email) # → not_the_desired@email.co.jp\n\n# Set current_user to the desired user\nclient.set_user_by_email('desired@email.com')\nprint(client.current_user.email) # → desired@email.com\n\n# You can also set the current_user by uid.\nclient.set_user_by_uid('<uid>')\nprint(client.current_user.email) # → desired@email.com\n```\n\n# _Quick plug: Learning Equality needs your support!_\n\nIf you'd like to support notion-py development, please consider [donating to my open-source nonprofit, Learning Equality](https://learningequality.org/donate/), since when I'm not working on notion-py, it probably means I'm heads-down fundraising for our global education work (bringing resources like Khan Academy to communities with no Internet).
