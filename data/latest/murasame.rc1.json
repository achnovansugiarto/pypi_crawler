Examples:\n\n  * AES and RSA encryption support\n  * CLI command processing\n  * GeoIP support\n  * JSON and YAML file support\n  * Product versioning with Semantic Versioning 2.0 support\n  * Support for global systems and singletons\n  * Certificate support\n\nRequirements\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nMake sure you have the following prerequisites:\n* A base install of Ubuntu with Git installed.\n\nMurasame is a framework that requires Python version 3.9 or newer, and it is\nnot compatible with Python 2.\n\nApplications developed with the framework are primarily meant to be run on a\nLinux platform, but the development environment is not restricted to Linux\nonly. It is recommended to use one of the following:\n\n* Apple Mac OS X 10.13.2 'High Sierra' or later\n* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later\n* Windows 10 or later\n\nIn terms of hardware the recommended configuration is at least an 8-core CPU\nwith 8 GB RAM, and preferably a fast SSD.\n\nInstallation\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are primarily two ways to install the framework. If you only want to use\nthe framework without modifying any of its source code, you should simply\ninstall it in your own environment, either in your real environment or inside\na virtualenv.\n\nYou can use pip to install the framework:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pip install murasame\n\nIf you want to have a raw version of the framework and make modifications of it\nyou should check out the repository of the framework and work with that.\n\nThe repository can be found on GitHub:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    https://github.com/suisei-entertainment/murasame\n\nMurasame comes with an environment setup script that can be invoked in two ways:\n\n* If the base operating system already has make installed, you can execute\n  the following command in the command line:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    make setup\n\n* If the base operating system doesn't have make installed, you have to call\n  the setup script manually in the command line:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    sudo ./scripts/envsetup\n\nThe setup script has to be executed with root privileges as it will install\nvarious packages on the host system.\n\nAfter the development environment has been installed the easiest way to get\nstarted is to build the documentation of the framework. This can be done by\nactivating the generated virtual environment with the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    source ~/.murasame/.env/bin/activate\n\nAfter that you can start the documentation build process by executing the\nfollowing command inside the virtual environment:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    make documentation\n\nOnce the documentation has been built, you can open index.html from\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    ~/.murasame/dist/documentation\n\nAlternatively, you can also access the latest released documentation of the\nframework on `readthedocs.io`_.\n\nContributing\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee the `development documentation`_ about ways you can contribute to the\nproject.\n\nCode of Conduct\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nEveryone interacting in the Twine project's codebases, issue trackers, chat\nrooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the\n`Code of Conduct`_.\n\n.. _`readthedocs.io`: https://murasame.readthedocs.io\n.. _`development documentation`: https://murasame.readthedocs.io\n.. _`Code of Conduct`: https://murasame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html\n\n",
