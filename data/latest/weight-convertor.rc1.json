    "description": "Weight_convertor is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.\n\nWeight_convertor is well suited for many different kinds of data:\n\nTabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\nOrdered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\nArbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\nAny other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\nThe two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, DataFrame provides everything that Râ€™s data.frame provides and much more. pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\nEasy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\nSize mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\nAutomatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\nPowerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\nMake it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\nIntelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\nIntuitive merging and joining data sets\nFlexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\nHierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\nRobust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\nTime series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\nMany of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages: munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.\n\n",
