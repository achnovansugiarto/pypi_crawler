    "description": "\n# markov-word-generator\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/markov-word-generator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/markov-word-generator) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)`\n\nA small Python library to generate random credible words based on a  list of words by estimating the probability of the next character from the frequency of the previous N ones.\nThis uses [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)\n\n\n# Installation\n```bash\npip install markov-word-generator\n```\n\n# Principle\n\nIn order to generate random words that sounds like real words, we need to analyze character distribution among a corpus in a given language.\nWe can start by analyzing the character apparition frequency based on the previous character.\n\nHere are heatmaps showing the distribution of each character (column) given the previous one (row).\n- `$` = End of word\n- `^` = Start of a word\n\nIn English:\n\n![English character distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/markov-word-generator/main/images/heatmap_EN-words.png)\n\nAnd in French:\n\n![French character distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/markov-word-generator/main/images/heatmap_FR-words.png)\n\nEstimating the probability of a character to appear given the probability of the given previous one works fine but is still hazardous. We can increase the likelihood of the world sounds true by looking at the next N previous characters.\n\nThe generator will parse an input text file containing one word per line (dictionary), count each character occurrence based on the occurrence of the N previous ones  create a mapping table for each character-combination and its associated frequency in the corpus.\n\n![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/markov-word-generator/main/images/diagram.png)\n\n# Usage\nParsing the English dictionary to create a pseudo-word that sounds English by generating characters one by one.\nIn this example, it works by analyzing the probability of each character to appear based on the last 4 ones.\n```python\nfrom markov_word_generator import MarkovWordGenerator\n\ngenerator = MarkovWordGenerator(\n\tmarkov_length=4,\n\tdictionary_filename='dictionaries/EN-words.dic'\n)\nprint(generator.generate_word())\n```\noutput:\n```\nrebutaneously\n```\n\n\n\n## Parameters\n\n- MarkovWordGenerator():\n  - `markov_length`: *int*. Number of previous characters the generator will take into account to compute probability of apparition of each the next character.\n   - `dictionary_filename`: *str*. Corpus the generator will parse to analyze character apparition frequency\n   - `ignore_accents`: *Optional boolean*. If set to *True*, Accents will not be considered while parsing *dictionary_filename*. Default to *False*\n\n- generate_word()\n  - seed: *Optional str*. If seed is set, it will generate a word starting with this seed\n```\ngenerator = MarkovWordGenerator(\n\tmarkov_length=4,\n\tdictionary_filename='dictionaries/EN-words.dic')\n\nprint(generator.generate_word(seed='ab'))\n```\n```\nabackle\n```\n\n\n## Impact of the markov_length parameter\n\n- The higher the number of characters N we take into account, the more credible the word will be. We may end up with already existing words (see [Impact of the markov_length parameter](#impact-of-the-markov_length-parameter) below).\n- Lowering N will lead to words that sound less real. Some words will also either very short (1-2 chars) or very long (>20chars)\n\n```python\ngenerator = MarkovWordGenerator(\n\tmarkov_length=N, # N=1,2,3,4 or 5 in following examples\n\tdictionary_filename='dictionaries/EN-words.dic'\n)\n\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    print(generator.generate_word())\n```\n\n### Length 1\n\noutput:\n```\neroun\nunteticakreatintes\nsucle\nerarums\neablatirlac\ne\nghils\nrllig\nbeseleforuat\nde\n```\n\n### Length 2\n\noutput:\n```\nmalle\ndallintathilight\nboaddly\nnobtiousle\ning\nalaymplaings\nrusle\nsprevircirdbages\nbant\nritablegruphicalls\n```\n\n### Length 3\n\noutput:\n```\nblungalinther\nsuper\nsolder\ndegreetricked\nmittlessly\nout\nhearf\nfracertory\ngyny\nlocious\n```\n\n### Length 4\n\noutput:\n```\nauthering\nnegligented\nmanoeistical\nbleat\nlover\nconfusions\ndest\nhand\ndisplay\nentwinkle\n```\n\n### Length 5\n\noutput:\n```\nsignificative\ncontention\ngrandmaidens\naidesdecamped\nparalleled\ncontradicate\nthereby\nnumskull\ncrises\nbattlegro\n```\n\n\n# Benchmarks\nEmpirically generating 5000 random words for each of the tests and checking the percentage of them which do exist as actual valid words.\n10 tests have been running.
