Many papers use image representations of network traffic, but reproducing their results was quite cumbersome. As a result, we found that there is currently no official library that supports reproducible images of network traffic. For this reason, we developed heiFIP to easily create images of network traffic and reproduce ML/DL results.\n\n## Main Features\n\n- **Different Images**: Currently, we support plain packet to byte representation, and flow to byte representation with one channel each. An image is created with same width and height for a quadratic representation.\n  - **Flow Images** converts a set of packets into an image. It supports the following modifications:\n    - **Max images dimension** allows you to specify the maximum image dimension. If the packet is larger than the specified size, it will cut the remaining pixel.\n    - **Min image dimesion** allows you to specify the minimum image dimension. If the packet is smaller than the specified size, it fills the remaining pixel with 0.\n    - **Remove duplicates** allows you to automatically remove same traffic.\n    - **Append** each flow to each other or write each packet to a new row.\n    - **Max packets per flow** allows you to specify the maximum number of packets per flow.\n  - **Packet Image** converts a single packet into an image.\n  - **Bidrectional Images** converts a bidirectional communication to an image.\n- **Header** processing also you to customize header fields of different protocols. It aims to remove biasing fields.\n  - **IPv4** and **IPv6**: tbd.\n  - **TCP** and **UDP**: tbd.\n  - **HTTP**: tbd.\n  - **DNS**: tbd.\n- **Remove Payload** options allows you to only work on header data.\n- **Fast and flexible**: We rely on [Scapy]() for our image generation and header processing.\n- **Machine learning orientation**: heiFIP aims to make Deep Learning approaches using network data as images reproducible and deployable. Using heiFIP as a common framework enables researches to test and verify their models.\n\n## Examples\n\n![SMB Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanDeveloper/heiFIP/main/examples/SMB.png?raw=true)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall our package using PyPi\n\n```sh\npip install heifip\n```\n\n```sh\n# Show help information\n> fip extract -h\nStarting FlowImageProcessor CLI\nUsage: fip extract [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -rd, --remove_duplicates      Within a single output folder belonging to a\n                                single input folder no duplicate images will\n                                be produced if two inputs lead to the same\n                                image\n  -mp, --min_packets INTEGER    Minimum packets that a FlowImage needs to\n                                have, 0=No minimum packets per flow\n  -maxid, --max_im_dim INTEGER  Maximum dim ouput images can have, 0=No\n                                maximum dim\n  -mid, --min_im_dim INTEGER    Minimum dim ouput images need to have, 0=No\n                                minimum dim\n  -p, --preprocess TEXT         Applies a preprocessing to the input data:\n                                none: No preprocessing payload: Only payload\n                                data is used header: Preprocesses headers\n                                (DNS,HTTP,IP,IPv6,TCP,UDP supported) to remove\n                                some biasing data\n  -t, --threads INTEGER         Number of parallel threads that can be used\n  -r, --read PATH\n  -w, --write PATH              Destination file path, stores result\n                                [required]\n  -h, --help                    Show this message and exit.\n\n> fip extract -r /PATH/PCAPs -w /PATH/IMAGES\n```\n\nImport FIPExtractor to run it inside your program:\n\n```python\nextractor = FIPExtractor()\nimg = extractor.create_image('./test/pcaps/dns/dns-binds.pcap')\nextractor.save_image(img, './test/pcaps/dns/dns-binds.pcap')\n```\n\n### Building from source\n\nSimply run:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n[NFStream](https://github.com/nfstream/nfstream) for the inspiration of the `README.md` and workflow testing.\n\n### Citation\n\nCurrently, we haven't publish any paper about our approach yet.\nIf you use heiFIP in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the following article:\n\n```latex\n@software{Stefan_heiFIP_A_network_2023,\n  author = {Stefan, Machmeier},\n  month = {1},\n  title = {{heiFIP: A network traffic image converter}},\n  version = {1.0.0},\n  year = {2023}\n}\n```\n\n### Authors\n\nThe following people contributed to heiFIP:\n\n- [Stefan Machmeier](https://github.com/stefanDeveloper): Creator\n- [Manuel Trageser](https://github.com/maxi99manuel99): Header extraction and customization.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the  EUPL-1.2 [**License**](license) - see the License file for details\n\n[license]: https://github.com/stefanDeveloper/heiFIP/blob/main/LICENSE\n",
