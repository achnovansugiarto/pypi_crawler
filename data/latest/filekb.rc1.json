    "description": "# fkb: A knowledge base with file tracking and document note integration\n\nAuthor: ArktisDev\n\nDate: January 15, 2023\n\nDerived from [kb](https://github.com/gnebbia/kb)\n\n## Purpose\n\nMy ideal knowledge base should interface directly with the file hierarchy already on disk and allow me to add tags as well as longer notes to any digital object I choose. After searching for a long time I wasn't able to find a satifactory non-proprietary program that did this while also working on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Some programs even required using a GUI which wasn't going to work on a headless server for example. I eventually found [kb](https://github.com/gnebbia/kb) which has a great minimalist design and functions as a lightweight CLI but doesn't actually fulfill all my requirements.\n\nAlthough kb does a great job of organizing notes it does not allow attaching notes to files which exist on the file hierarchy. For example I would be able to add a pdf file to KB but I would not be able to write a detailed note about the pdf file. Because of this I wrote fkb, a derivative of kb which allows adding files to the knowledge base and attaching notes to each file. As a result of this notes not attached to a file are not allowed in fkb while they are allowed in kb.\n\nThis sort of functionality is extremely useful for organizing all sorts of documents. Personally I use it to organize textbooks and academic papers as well as personal documents, cooking recipes, and images. Any sorts of documents can be organized using fkb.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nI use Python 3.9 but [vermin](https://github.com/netromdk/vermin) claims it should work with at least Python 3.6.\n\nTo install the most recent stable version just use pip:\n\n```\npip install --user filekb\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing fkb for the first time it will prompt you to setup the directory to store fkb data as well as the root directory for your knowledge base. Files outside this root directory cannot be added to the knowledge base.\n\n### Listing objects\n\nList all objects using the `fkb list` command. It is optional to include additional filters on the objects. These are documented in the `fkb list --help` help menu.\n\nBelow you can see two quantum mechanics textbooks added to fkb.\n![fkb_list_output](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_list.png?raw=true)\n\nIf you add a title to filter by only objects matching the filter are shown\n![fkb_list_filter_output](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_list_filter.png?raw=true)\n\nSpecifying the `--verbose` option the file path on disk of the added objects is shown.\n![fkb_list_file_path](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_list_file_path.png?raw=true)\n\n### Adding objects\nYou can add objects to the database with `fkb add <path_to_object>`. Both absolute and relative paths work but the object must exist in your configured root directory. Additional options allow you to configure the author, category, and tags.\n\n![fkb_add_object](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_add_object.png?raw=true)\n\n### Updating objects\nOnce an object has been edited, it's title, category, author, tags can all be updated using the `fkb update` command. Since I didn't add a category to my solutions manual I added, let's do that now\n\n![fkb_update_object](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_update_object.png?raw=true)\n\n\n### Adding a note to an object\nGiven the id of an object `fkb note edit` can be used to edit a note for that object. This will open a text file in whichever editor you decided in the configuration of fkb. Once a note exists, it can be written to terminal using `fkb note cat`. In the example my note contains \"This textbook covers...\". The note can also be deleted completely with the `fkb note delete` command.\n\n![fkb_note](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_note.png?raw=true)\n\n### Searching through notes\n\nSearching through notes can be done using the `fkb grep` command. In this example I added the text \"a b c\" to the GriffithQM object and \"a b c d\" to the GriffithQMSolutions object.\n\n![fkb_grep](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_grep.png?raw=true)\n\n### Backups\n\nBackups of the knowledge base can be made with `fkb backup export`. The backup can then be imported using `fkb backup import`. It is not supported to import a backup using a different root knowledge base directory or fkb internal storage directory. This would be a good feature to implement however!\n\n### Erasing knowledge base\n\nThe knowledge base can be erased using the `fkb erase` command. If you wish to keep configuration files but wipe only objects added to the knowledge base you can specify the option `fkb erase --db`.\n\n### Watch for file changes\n\nBecause fkb keeps track of actual files on the disk, it should react to those files being renamed and moved by automatically updating the database entries for those files. The `fkb watch` command runs an infinite loop using the `watchdog` package to track file changes in the knowledge base root directory. I personally start `fkb watch` using a systemd user service that runs in the background, but there are at least 10 different ways to run `fkb watch` in the background automatically.\n\nBelow is an example of what `fkb watch` does running in the background. My changes to the file names are automatically propagated to the knowledge base.\n\n![fkb_watch](https://github.com/ArktisDev/fkb/blob/main/img/fkb_watch.png?raw=true)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright 2023, ArktisDev\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
