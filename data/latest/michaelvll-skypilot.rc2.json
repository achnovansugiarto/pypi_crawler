    "description": "# Sky\n\n![pytest](https://github.com/sky-proj/sky/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)\n\nSky is a framework to run any workload seamlessly across different cloud providers through a unified interface. No knowledge of cloud offerings is required or expected â€“ you simply define the workload and its resource requirements, and Sky will automatically execute it on AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure.\n\n<!-- TODO: We need a logo here -->\n## Getting Started\nPlease refer to our [documentation](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).\n- [Installation](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)\n- [Quickstart](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting-started/quickstart.html)\n- [Sky CLI](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/cli.html)\n\n## Developer Guide\n### Setup\nUse editable mode (`-e`) when installing:\n```bash\n# Sky requires python >= 3.6 and < 3.10.\n# You can just install the dependencies for\n# certain clouds, e.g., \".[aws,azure,gcp]\"\npip install -e \".[all]\"\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\n### Submitting pull requests\n- After you commit, format your code with [`format.sh`](./format.sh).\n- In the PR description, write a `Tested:` section to describe relevant tests performed.\n- For changes that touch the core system, run the [smoke tests](#testing) and ensure they pass.\n- Follow the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\n\n\n### Environment Variable Options\n- `export SKY_DEV=1` to show debugging logs (logging.DEBUG).\n- `export SKY_DISABLE_USAGE_COLLECTION=1` to disable usage logging.\n- `export SKY_MINIMIZE_LOGGING=1` to minimize the sky outputs for demo purpose.\n\n### Dump timeline\n\nTimeline is useful for performance analysis and debugging in Sky.\n\nHere are the APIs:\n\n```python\n\nfrom utils import timeline\n\n\n# record a function in the timeline with the function path name\n@timeline.Event.decorator\ndef f(): ...\n\n\n# record a function in the timeline using name='my_name'\n@timeline.Event.decorator(name='event_name')\ndef f(): ...\n\n\n# record an event over a code block in the timeline:\nwith timeline.Event(name='event_name'):\n  ...\n\n# use a file lock with event:\nwith timeline.FileLockEvent(lockpath):\n  pass\n```\n\nTo dump the timeline, set environment variable `SKY_TIMELINE_FILE_PATH` to a file path.\n\nView the dumped timeline file using `Chrome` (chrome://tracing) or [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).\n\n### Updating the sky docker image\n1. Authenticate with sky ECR repository. Contact romil.bhardwaj@berkeley.edu for access:\n   ```\n   aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/a9w6z7w5\n   ```\n\n2. Build and tag the docker image:\n   ```\n   docker build -t public.ecr.aws/a9w6z7w5/sky:latest .\n   ```\n\n3. Push the image to ECR:\n   ```\n   docker push public.ecr.aws/a9w6z7w5/sky:latest\n   ```\n\n### Some general engineering practice suggestions\n\nThese are suggestions, not strict rules to follow. When in doubt, follow the [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\n\n* Use `TODO(author_name)`/`FIXME(author_name)` instead of blank `TODO/FIXME`. This is critical for tracking down issues. You can write TODOs with your name and assign it to others (on github) if it is someone else's issue.\n* Delete your branch after merging it. This keeps the repo clean and faster to sync.\n* Use an exception if this is an error. Only use `assert` for debugging or proof-checking purpose. This is because exception messages usually contain more information.\n* Use modern python features and styles that increases code quality.\n  * Use f-string instead of `.format()` for short expressions to increase readability.\n  * Use `class MyClass:` instead of `class MyClass(object):`. The later one was a workaround for python2.x.\n  * Use `abc` module for abstract classes to ensure all abstract methods are implemented.\n  * Use python typing. But you should not import external objects just for typing. Instead, import typing-only external objects under `if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:`.\n\n### Testing\nTo run smoke tests:\n```\nbash tests/run_smoke_tests.sh\n\n# Run one of the smoke tests\nbash tests/run_smoke_tests.sh test_minimal\n```\n\nFor profiling code, use:\n```\npip install tuna # Tuna for viz\npython3 -m cProfile -o sky.prof -m sky.cli status # Or some other command\ntuna sky.prof\n```\n",
