    "description": "LAVA Core\n=========\n\nhttp://xkcd.com/927/\n\nSeriously, lava has way to many tiny pieces. It all started when we renamed\nlaunch-control to lava-dashboard and created lava-server in the process. Now\nit's getting in the way.\n\nSo here we are, lava-core is the start of the merge. Subsequent projects will\nslowly merge into the core. Then one day we may just get a package that is\ncalled 'lava', that ships a program called 'lava' that does useful stuff.\n\n\nQuickstart\n==========\n\nSee doc/QUICKSTART.\n\n\nAndroid Debug Bridge (adb) installation\n=======================================\n\nTo run android test job, adb is common to be used.\n\nFor installing adb, you can download the SDK from \nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\n\nBy default, the SDK files are unpacked into a directory named \nandroid-sdk-<machine-platform>.\n\nYou can find the adb tool in <sdk>/platform-tools/.\n\nYou might want to add the location of the SDK's tools/ and platform-tools \nto your PATH environment variable, to provide easy access to the tools.",
