    "description": "# Welcome to SportsX SDK Documentation\n\n# Overview\n\nThe STX SDK is a wrapper around the Sportsx Graphql APIs and Phoenix channels.\nThe SDK provides object-oriented APIs to connect with the available Sportsx APIs and socket channels.\nThe SDK is built on the following libraries:\n - GQL: https://github.com/graphql-python/gql\n - Websockets: https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis library is compatible with the following versions of Python:\n\n - 3.7\n - 3.8\n - 3.9\n\n# Developer Guide:\n\nDetailed developer guide and demo scripts are available on this [link](https://github.com/stxapp/pysdk-demo)\n\nThere are two services available **StxClient** and **StxChannelClient**\n\n - **StxClient** provides sync operations, while\n - **StxChannelClient** provides connectivity with websocket channels.\n\n## Steps to build python package and upload to PyPI\n\nSome commands require a newer version of pip, so start by making sure you have the latest version installed:\n\n - For Linux/Mac:\n\n    ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip```\n - For Windows:\n\n    ```py -m pip install --upgrade pip```\n\n ### Setting up build package version\n\nOpen `pyproject.toml` file and update the `version` field with the new version name.\n\n ### Generating distribution archives (built package)\n\nThe next step is to generate distribution packages for the package.\nThese are archives that are uploaded to the Python Package Index and can be installed by pip.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of PyPA’s build installed:\n\n - For Linux/Mac:\n\n    ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade build```\n - For Windows:\n\n    ```py -m pip install --upgrade build```\n\nNow run the following command from the root directory where pyproject.toml is located:\n\n - For Linux/Mac:\n\n    ```python3 -m build```\n - For Windows:\n\n    ```py -m build```\n\nThis command should output a lot of text listing all the packaged files and once completed\nshould generate two files in the dist directory:\n\n    dist/\n        ├── stx_pysdk-VERSION_NUMBER-py3-none-any.whl\n        └── stx-pysdk-VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz\n\nThe `tar.gz` file is a source distribution whereas the `.whl` file is a built distribution.\nNewer pip versions preferentially install built distributions, but will fall back to source distributions if needed.\n\n### Uploading the distribution archives (built package)\n\nFinally, it’s time to upload your package to the Python Package Index!\n\nYou’ll need to install Twine if not already installed, reinstalling it makes sure you have the latest version\nTwine is used to upload the distribution packages.\n\n - For Linux/Mac:\n\n    ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine```\n - For Windows:\n\n    ```py -m pip install --upgrade twine```\n\nOnce installed, run Twine to upload all the archives under dist:\n\n - For Linux/Mac:\n\n    ```python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*```\n - For Windows:\n\n    ```py -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*```\n\nYou will be prompted for a username and password.\n\nAfter the command completes, you should see output similar to this:\n\n    Uploading distributions to https://pypi.org/legacy/\n    Enter your username: <USERNAME>\n    Enter your password: <PASSWORD>\n    Uploading stx_pysdk-VERSION_NUMBER-py3-none-any.whl\n    100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 8.2/8.2 kB • 00:01 • ?\n    Uploading stx-pysdk-VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz\n    100% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 6.8/6.8 kB • 00:00 • ?\n\nOnce uploaded, your package should be viewable on PyPI; https://pypi.org/project/stx-pysdk/\n",
