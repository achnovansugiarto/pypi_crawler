In these cases, we would like to use\nthe new batch of data provided to update our previous model with limited costs.\nUnfortunately, since data in different chunks is not sampled according to the same distribution,\njust fine-tuning the old model creates problems like *catastrophic forgetting*.\nThe algorithms in Renate help mitigating the negative impact of forgetting and increase the \nmodel performance overall. \n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/Renate/main/doc/_images/improvement_renate.svg\n    :scale: 80%\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Renate vs Model Fine-Tuning.\n\n    Renate's update mechanisms improve over naive fine-tuning approaches. [#]_\n\nRenate also offers hyperparameter optimization (HPO), a functionality that can heavily impact\nthe performance of the model when continuously updated. To do so, Renate employs\n`Syne Tune <https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune>`_ under the hood, and can offer\nadvanced HPO methods such multi-fidelity algorithms (ASHA) and transfer learning algorithms\n(useful for speeding up the retuning).\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/Renate/main/doc/_images/improvement_tuning.svg\n    :scale: 80%\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Impact of HPO on Renate's Updating Algorithms.\n\n    Renate will benefit from hyperparameter tuning compared to Renate with default settings. [#]_\n\n\nKey features\n============\n\n* Easy to scale and run in the cloud\n* Designed for real-world retraining pipelines\n* Advanced HPO functionalities available out-of-the-box\n* Open for experimentation \n\n\nWhat are you looking for?\n=========================\n\n* `Installation Instructions <https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/install.html>`_\n\n    .. code-block:: bash\n\n      pip install renate\n\n* Examples\n    We provide examples to train your model\n    `locally <https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/train_mlp_locally.html>`_\n    or `using Amazon SageMaker <https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/train_classifier_sagemaker.html>`_.\n* `Documentation <https://renate.readthedocs.io>`_\n* `Supported Algorithms <https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/supported_algorithms.html>`_\n* `Experimenting with Renate <https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking/index.html>`_\n* `Guidelines for Contributors <https://github.com/awslabs/renate/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_\n* You did not find what you were looking for?\n    Open an `issue <https://github.com/awslabs/Renate/issues/new>`_ and we will do our best\n    to improve the documentation.\n\n\n.. [#] To create this plot, we simulated class-incremental learning with CIFAR-10.\n    The training data was divided into 5 partitions, and we trained sequentially on them.\n    Fine-tuning refers to the strategy to learn on the first partition from scratch, and\n    train on each of the subsequent partitions for few epochs only.\n    We compare to Experience Replay with a memory size of 500.\n    For both methods we use the same number of epochs and choose the best checkpoint\n    using a validation set.\n    Results reported are on the test set.\n.. [#] The setup is the same as in the last experiment. However, this time we compare\n    Experience Replay against a version in which its hyperparameters were tuned.\n",
