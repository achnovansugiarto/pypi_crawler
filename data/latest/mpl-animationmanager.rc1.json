    "description": "Matplotlib animation manager (GUI)\n**********************************************\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/mpl-animationmanager.svg\n        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpl-animationmanager\n        :alt: status\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mpl-animationmanager.svg\n        :target: https://github.com/luchko/mpl-animationmanager/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n        :alt: License\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/mpl-animationmanager/badge/?version=latest\n        :target: http://mpl-animationmanager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n        :alt: Documentation Status\n\nIt is a small convenient tool which allows to setup and save the gif/mp4 animations using the `PyQt <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_ based GUI built on top of the `matplotlib animation module <http://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html>`_. Program can deal with both 2D and 3D animation. For 3D axes manager can add additional rotation of the view point resulting in both object modification and rotation animation. Also animation manager can be easily integrated in your larger PyQt project as a dialog. For more details see the Quitckstart section.\n\n- Git-hub repo: https://github.com/luchko/mpl_animationmanager\n- Documentation: https://mpl-animationmanager.readthedocs.io\n\nTool is compatible with Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ and PyQt4 4.6+ or PyQt5 5.2+.\n\n-------------------------\n\n.. figure::  https://github.com/luchko/mpl_animationmanager/blob/master/img_src/demo.gif?raw=true\n   :align:   center\n   :figwidth: 100 %\n\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n=========\n\n- ``mpl_animationmanager`` library contains two classes ``AnimationManager`` and ``QDialogAnimManager`` with the same input arguments.\n- ``QDialogAnimManager`` is inherited from the PyQt ``QDialog``. Using this class you can easily integrate animation manager as a QDialog into your larger PyQt application.\n- ``AnimationManager`` is a small class build on top of the ``QDialogAnimManager`` and uses the input arguments to initialize the ``QDialogAnimManager`` object and run a PyQt application using ``run()`` function.\n- After passing the required arguments to the manager, user can setup animation properties such as: dpi, fps (frames per second), modification period.\n- For 3D animation user can also setup the rotation period, elevation and initilal azimut angles. The resulting duration of the animation equals the least common multiple of modification and rotaion periods if both are provided.\n- Animation can be saved in gif or mp4 format by picking one of the preinstalled movie writers used by matplotlib (imagemagick, ffmpeg etc.).",
