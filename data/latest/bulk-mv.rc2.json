It works by typing `+ path/to/new/file.txt` on a new line.\nIf any directories along the path to this new file don't exist, bmv will create them.\n\n```\n+ web/fonts/\n\nweb/\nweb/pages/\n...\n```\n\n## Deleting files/directories\n\nYou can delete files or directories using the `-` operator. It works by typing `- path/to/new/file.txt` on a new line.\n\n```\nweb/\n...\nweb/images/photo.jpg\n- web/images/delete_me.jpg\n```\n\n\n## Renaming files/directories\n\nYou can rename files or directories using the `->` operator. \n\n```\nweb/\nweb/pages/\nweb/pages/a.html -> web/pages/c.html\nweb/pages/b.html -> web/pages/d.html\n```\n\n\n## Moving files/directories\n\nYou can move files or directories using the `=>` operator. Moving files to paths with non-existent directories *will not be created automatically*.\nUse the `add` operator to do it first.\n\n```\nweb/\nweb/static/\nweb/images/ => web/static/images/\nweb/images/photo.jpg\nweb/images/delete_me.jpg\n```\n\n## Putting it all together.\n\nSay you wanted to:\n\n1. Delete the `delete_me.jpg` file.\n2. Move the `images` folder to the `static` folder.\n3. Rename `main.js` to `script.js`\n4. Create a `web/fonts/` folder\n\nYou would write:\n\n```\n+ web/fonts/\n\nweb/\nweb/pages/\nweb/pages/a.html\nweb/pages/b.html\n\nweb/static/\nweb/static/main.css\nweb/static/main.js -> web/static/script.js\n\nweb/images/ => web/static/images/\nweb/images/photo.jpg\n- web/images/delete_me.jpg\n```\n\nWhen you save and quit vim, `bmv` will perform all the operations.\n\n## Order of operations\n\nOperations are given the following precedence:\n\n1. add\n2. delete\n3. rename\n4. move\n\n\n",
