    "description": "pippy\n=====\n\npippy is a pip extension that will allow you to keep local copies of prebuilt\npython packages. It's main purpose is to be used with virtstrap so that\nvirtstrap can create copies of each project without ever having to download or\nbuild anything. It accomplishes this only when it knows the exact version of\nthe package you wish to download. Otherwise it behaves just as pip would\nbehave.\n\nSince virtstrap generates a VEfile.lock (similar to Ruby Bundler's\nGemfile.lock). Virtstrap tracks the exact version of the software you're using.\nFor this very reason, pippy is planned to be included in virtstrap.\n\nLocal Package Storage\n---------------------\n\nBy default pippy stores all of the packages in ``~/.pippy``. To change this\ndirectory just change the environment variable ``PIPPY_CACHE`` to point to the\ndesired directory. The folder structure for the storage is this::\n\n    ~/.pippy\n        packages/\n            source/ # <- stores the sources for packages\n                package-name/\n                    .. tons of zips/tars ..\n                package-name/\n                package-name/\n            cpython/ # <- stores builds for cpython\n                2.5/    # <- stores builds for python 2.5\n                    package-name/\n                        .. tons of tars ..\n                2.6/    # <- for python 2.6\n                ... more python versions ...\n            pypy/ # <- stores builds for pypy\n            ... more implementations ...\n\nThe CLI currently only accepts one argument, a pip requirements file::\n    \n    pippy [requirementsfile]\n\nIt is highly suggested that the requirements file use only exact specifications\nfor the requirements.\n\nFurther Development\n-------------------\n\nEventually, pippy will provide almost the same commands as pip, plus some\nadditional commands for managing the installed packages.\n\nFuture Commands\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n- ``install`` - Will work the same as ``pip install``\n- ``manage`` - Will manage all the packages in pippy's cache.\n- ``uninstall`` - A convenience operation to pip's uninstall command\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nThese issues will be rectified as soon as possible\n\n- Doesn't adequately support custom package indexes. It'll work, but it's use\n  is highly discouraged at this time.\n- Isn't known to work with Windows",
