    "description": "# BioMedICUS Client\n\nThe BioMedical Information Collection and Understanding System (BioMedICUS) is a system for large-scale text analysis and processing of biomedical and clinical reports. The system is being developed by the Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction Program at the University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics.\n\nThis is a collaborative project that aims to serve biomedical and clinical researchers, allowing for customization with different texts.\n\nMore information about BioMedICUS can be found on our [website](https://nlpie.github.io/biomedicus).\n\nThis package contains the client code for processing documents using deployed BioMedICUS services. The package containing the services themselves is ``biomedicus``.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)\n- [Java JDK 8+](https://adoptium.net). Note, you will need to have the [\"java\" command on the your \"$PATH\"](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).\n\n## Installation\n\n[Installation instructions are available on our website](https://nlpie.github.io/biomedicus/guides/installation.html).\n\n## Guides\n\n[Additional guides for usage and development are also available on our website](https://nlpie.github.io/biomedicus/guides/).\n\n## Contact\n\nBioMedICUS is developed by the [NLP/IE Group](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/research/nlpie-group) at the University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics. You can contact us at [nlp-ie@umn.edu](mailto:nlp-ie@umn.edu).\n",
