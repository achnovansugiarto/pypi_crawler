the tableau is shown.\n\nThe exit status is 0 if the game was solved,\n1 if it was unsolvable,\nand 255 if the input was invalid.\n\n\n## Computational approach\n\nThe solver categorizes all possible moves\ninto *safe builds*, *foundation moves*, *blocking moves*, and *mercis*.\n\n* **Safe builds**: Cards that can be moved to another location on the tableau\n  without removing any moves from the set of possible future moves\n  (except, of course, the safe build itself).\n  These include moving a card onto a king,\n  moving a card onto a fan with only one card,\n  and moving a card onto a sequence of two or more descending cards of the same suit.\n\n  There are other edge cases that are safe builds,\n  but the only consequence of leaving them out of the solver's definition\n  is that the search might take a bit longer,\n  so they're ignored for simplicity.\n\n* **Foundation moves**: Cards that can be moved directly onto a foundation.\n  These are also safe in the sense that they don't remove any possible future moves.\n\n* **Blocking moves**: Other moves of cards onto other cards in the tableau.\n  While these moves can allow further safe builds or foundation moves\n  that wouldn't otherwise be possible,\n  they can also prevent other cards from being moved to useful places,\n  and they cannot ever be undone or the card moved again to anywhere other than the foundation,\n  so these moves need to be considered carefully.\n\n* **Mercis**: In the ruleset including a *merci*,\n  at some point during the third deal,\n  you can pick up one card that's not at the top of its fan\n  and place it somewhere on the tableau or foundation.\n  The solver weights these equally with blocking moves\n  and considers them at the same time,\n  when mercis are enabled, the current deal is the last deal,\n  and no merci has yet happened this deal.\n  Otherwise, it skips looking for them entirely.\n\nWe benefit from doing safe builds and foundation moves\nas soon as they're available,\nwhile blocking moves and mercis should be done\nonly when these possibilities are exhausted.\nCompleting safe builds and foundation moves as soon as they're available\nremoves enough computational complexity that a brute-force depth-first search\non blocking moves and mercis\nbecomes practical;\noptimally solved games typically use a single-digit number of blocking moves.\n\nThe general structure of the solver algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Starting from the initial position,\n   the solver builds an implicit tree (via recursion)\n   of all possible sequences of blocking moves or mercis\n   (if enabled and allowed on the current deal).\n2. After every blocking move/merci,\n   it applies all possible safe builds and foundation moves\n   (alternating between doing all the safe builds possible\n    and all the foundation moves possible\n    until there are no more of either).\n   Then it tries another blocking move or merci.\n3. Recursion continues until the tableau is empty\n   or there are no more legal moves.\n4. At every branch,\n   the child candidate sequence of moves that results in\n   the most cards transferred to the foundation\n   is passed back up to the parent.\n   Since the tableau will be reshuffled (or useless, on the last deal)\n   after all foundation moves are made,\n   nothing else matters.\n   (If at any point there are multiple possible sequences\n    with the same number of foundations transfers,\n    the one chosen is the one tried first.)\n5. Back at the top level,\n   the best possible sequence and the resulting tableau and foundations\n   are displayed to the user.\n6. If the tableau isn't empty,\n   redeals were requested,\n   and this wasn't the last deal,\n   the tableau is gathered up, reshuffled, and redealt,\n   and the process begins again from step 1.\n\nThe first level of the recursive tree is split into threads\nto speed up the process.\nThis is often suboptimal\ndepending on how many possible moves there are in the initial state,\nbut it's a very quick and easy way to get a usually reasonable number,\nand the solver almost always finishes in under a minute\n(often seconds or milliseconds -- the complexity of deals seems to have high variance)\nanyway.\n\n\n",
