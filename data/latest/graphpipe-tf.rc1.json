    "description": "# GraphPipe helpers for TensorFlow\n\nThis package contains helpers and examples for using GraphPipe with tensorflow.\nIt contains a new plug-in operation for tensorflow that makes a call to a\nGraphPipe remote model from within a local tensorflow graph.  The new operation\nis called remote_op and communicates with the remote model using libcurl and\nthe GraphPipe protocol.\n\nAdditionaly, a new keras layer is included based on the remote operation.  This\nallows you to include a layer in a keras model that makes a remote call.\n\nFinally, various examples are included of serving tensorflow models in python.\nFor production, a more performant server like\n[`graphpipe-tf`](https://github.com/oracle/graphpipe-go/cmd/graphpipe-tf) is\nrecommended, but the python server is useful for experimentation.\n\n## List Of Examples\n\n * [Jupyter Notebook: serving and querying VGG with\n   GraphPipe](examples/RemoteModelWithGraphPipe.ipynb)\n * [Complete client/server example](examples/simple_request.py)\n * [Simple tensorflow model server](examples/model_server.py)\n * [Keras to GraphDef](examples/convert.py)\n * [Using a remote operation](examples/call_remote_op.py)\n * [Tensorflow graph to GraphDef](examples/tf_graph.py)\n\n## Build\n\nBuilding manually requires a few libraries to be installed, but the Makefile\nwill happily run a build for you in a docker container.\n```\n  make build\n```\n\nSee `build_linux.sh` for the additional headers besides libcurl that you will\nneed to build the C library. (From tensorflow and flatbuffers)\n\nIf you've successfully built the C library, to build installation packages:\n\n    python setup.py bdist_wheel\n\nNote that these are not manylinux wheels and depend on libcurl being installed\n\n\n",
