They provide a conceptual \ntoolkit for building complex models just by drawing an intuitive picture. \nThey are at the heart of a diverse range of programs, including genefinding, \nprofile searches, multiple sequence alignment and regulatory site identification. \nHMMs are the Legos of computational sequence analysis.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/harshrai96/TreeHMM/raw/master/Readme_images/HMM.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n### Why a Hidden Markov model(HMM)?\n\n* There are lots of cases where you can't observe the states you are interested in but you\ncan see the effect of being in the state. The observed effect of being in the state is called \"emissions\" or \"observations\".\n\n### What is a tree?\nIn graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. \nTree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. It has the following properties.\n\n* One node is marked as Root node.\n* Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.\n* Each node can have an arbitrary number of child node.\n\n### What is a Poly-tree?\n\n* A poly-tree is simply a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.\n\n### What is a Tree Hidden Markov model(TreeHMM)?\n* It is the same as an HMM but where the states are linked via a (poly)tree structure rather than a simple path. \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/harshrai96/TreeHMM/raw/master/Readme_images/Rooted_tree.png\" width=\"600\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/harshrai96/TreeHMM/raw/master/Readme_images/Polytree_hmm.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n\n### What is forward-backward algorithm?\n* The Forwardâ€“Backward algorithm is the conventional, recursive, efficient\n way to evaluate a Hidden Markov Model, that is, to compute the probability of \n an observation sequence given the model. This probability can be used to classify\n observation sequences in recognition applications.\n The goal of the forward-backward algorithm is to find the conditional \n distribution over hidden states given the data.\n\n <img src=\"https://github.com/harshrai96/TreeHMM/raw/master/Readme_images/Forward.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n <img src=\"https://github.com/harshrai96/TreeHMM/raw/master/Readme_images/Backward.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n### What is baum-welch algorithm?\n\n* The Baum-Welch algorithm is a dynamic programming approach and a \nspecial case of the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM algorithm).\nThe purpose is to tune the parameters of the HMM, namely the state \ntransition matrix, the emission matrix, and the initial state distribution,\nsuch that the model is maximally like the observed data.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites \n#### Create a virtual environment \n\n* At it's core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have it's own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\n\n* On macOS and Linux:\n\n        python3 -m venv envname\n\n* On Windows:\n\n        py -m venv envname        \n#### Activate the virtual environment\n\n* On macOS and Linux:\n\n        source env/bin/activate\n* On Windows:\n\n        .\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n\n### Installation\n\n        pip install treehmm\n\n\n# Package Documentation\n\nThis is an extension to normal HMMs where the states are connected via a\npoly-tree structure rather than simply a path. Moreover, upon available data, \nsome of the hidden states can be observed, and hence, can be estimated more \naccurately.\"\nThis package is based on a R package and is 40% faster than it.\n\nThere are six python files of interest.\n\n* initialize_HMM.py\n* backward_sequence_generator.py\n* forward_sequence_generator.py\n* backward.py\n* forward.py\n* baumWelch.py\n\n\n## initialize_HMM.py \n\n### Description \n\n* Initializing treeHMM with given parameters\n\n### Usage \n\n* def initialize_HMM(states, emissions, adjacent_symmetry_matrix, initial_probabilities=None, state_transition_probabilities=None, emission_probabilities=None):\n\n### Arguments\n\n* states : It is a numpy array with first element being discrete state value for the cases(or positive) and second element being discrete state value for the controls(or negative) for given treeHMM.\n* emissions: It is a list of numpy array consisting discrete values of\n            emissions(where \"M\" is the possible number of emissions) for each\n            feature variable\n* adjacent_symmetry_matrix: It is the Adjacent Symmetry Matrix that\n            describes the topology of the tree\n* initial_probabilities: It is a numpy array of shape (N * 1) containing\n            initial probabilities for the states, where \"N\" is the possible\n            number of states(Optional).

Default is 50\n* delta: Additional termination condition, if the transition and emission matrices converge, before reaching the maximum number of iterations(code{maxIterations}). The difference of transition and emission parameters in consecutive iterations must be smaller than code{delta} to terminate the algorithm. Default is 1e-5.\n* pseudoCount: Adding this amount of pseudo counts in the estimation-step of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
