For nested complex architectures, you can use a maximum depth of display as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.models import densenet121\nfrom torchscan import summary\n\nmodel = densenet121().eval().cuda()\nsummary(model, (3, 224, 224), max_depth=2)\n```\n\nwhich would yield\n\n```shell\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nLayer                        Type                  Output Shape              Param #        \n==========================================================================================\ndensenet                     DenseNet              (-1, 1000)                0              \n├─features                   Sequential            (-1, 1024, 7, 7)          0              \n|    └─conv0                 Conv2d                (-1, 64, 112, 112)        9,408          \n|    └─norm0                 BatchNorm2d           (-1, 64, 112, 112)        257            \n|    └─relu0                 ReLU                  (-1, 64, 112, 112)        0              \n|    └─pool0                 MaxPool2d             (-1, 64, 56, 56)          0              \n|    └─denseblock1           _DenseBlock           (-1, 256, 56, 56)         338,316        \n|    └─transition1           _Transition           (-1, 128, 28, 28)         33,793         \n|    └─denseblock2           _DenseBlock           (-1, 512, 28, 28)         930,072        \n|    └─transition2           _Transition           (-1, 256, 14, 14)         133,121        \n|    └─denseblock3           _DenseBlock           (-1, 1024, 14, 14)        2,873,904      \n|    └─transition3           _Transition           (-1, 512, 7, 7)           528,385        \n|    └─denseblock4           _DenseBlock           (-1, 1024, 7, 7)          2,186,272      \n|    └─norm5                 BatchNorm2d           (-1, 1024, 7, 7)          4,097          \n├─classifier                 Linear                (-1, 1000)                1,025,000      \n==========================================================================================\nTrainable params: 7,978,856\nNon-trainable params: 0\nTotal params: 7,978,856\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nModel size (params + buffers): 30.76 Mb\nFramework & CUDA overhead: 423.57 Mb\nTotal RAM usage: 454.32 Mb\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFloating Point Operations on forward: 5.74 GFLOPs\nMultiply-Accumulations on forward: 2.87 GMACs\nDirect memory accesses on forward: 2.90 GDMAs\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n```\n\nResults are aggregated to the selected depth for improved readability.\n\nFor reference, here are explanations of a few acronyms:\n\n- **FLOPs**: floating-point operations (not to be confused with FLOPS which is FLOPs per second)\n- **MACs**: mutiply-accumulate operations (cf. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation))\n- **DMAs**: direct memory accesses (many argue that it is more relevant than FLOPs or MACs to compare model inference speeds cf. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access))\n\n\n\nAdditionally, for highway nets (models without multiple branches / skip connections), `torchscan` supports receptive field estimation.\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.models import vgg16\nfrom torchscan import summary\n\nmodel = vgg16().eval().cuda()\nsummary(model, (3, 224, 224), receptive_field=True, max_depth=0)\n```\n\nwhich will add the layer's receptive field (relatively to the last convolutional layer) to the summary.\n\n\n## Setup\n\nPython 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are required to install Torchscan.\n\n### Stable release\n\nYou can install the last stable release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/torch-scan/) as follows:\n\n```shell\npip install torchscan\n```\n\nor using [conda](https://anaconda.org/frgfm/torchscan):\n\n```shell\nconda install -c frgfm torchscan\n```\n\n### Developer installation\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to use the latest features of the project that haven't made their way to a release yet, you can install the package from source:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/frgfm/torch-scan.git\npip install -e torch-scan/.\n```\n\n\n## Benchmark\n\nBelow are the results for classification models supported by `torchvision` for a single image with 3 color channels of size `224x224` (apart from  `inception_v3`   which uses `299x299`).\n\n| Model              | Params (M) | FLOPs (G) | MACs (G) | DMAs (G) |
