IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe configuration of the rules is done in \"Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation Rules\".\n\nCreation of a rule:\n\nProperties that define where the rule will be applied:\n\n* Location: Define where the rule will look for goods (a parent of the move's source location).\n* Rule Domain: The rule is used only if the Stock Move matches the domain.\n\nRemoval rules for the locations:\n\n* Quants Domain: this domain includes/excludes quants based on a domain.\n* Advanced Removal Strategy: the strategy that will be used for this location\n  and sub-location when the rule is used.\n\nThe sequences have to be sorted in the view list to define the reservation priorities.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIf you are using a database with demo data, you can give a try\nto the following scenario to understand how it works.\n\nThe demo data created by the module contains:\n\nA product: Funky Socks\n\n3 Locations:\n\n* Stock / Zone A / Bin A1: 200 Funky socks\n* Stock / Zone B / Bin B1: 100 Funky socks\n* Stock / Zone C / Bin C1: 100 Funky socks\n\n3 Reservation Rules, in the following order\n\n* Zone A must have full quantities\n* Zone B\n* Zone C\n\n2 Delivery Orders:\n\n* Origin: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 1)\n* Origin: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 2)\n\nScenario:\n\n* Activate Storage Locations and Multi-Warehouses\n* You can open Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation Rules to activate\n  and see the rules (by default in demo, the rules are created inactive)\n* Open Transfer: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 1)\n* Check availability: it has 150 units, as it will not empty Zone A, it will not\n  take products there, it should take 100 in B and 50 in C (following the rules\n  order)\n* Unreserve this transfer (to test the second case)\n* Open Transfer: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 2)\n* Check availability: it has 250 units, it can empty Zone A, it will take 200 in\n  Bin A1 and 50 in Bin B1.\n* If you want to explore further, you can add a custom domain to exclude rules\n  (for instance, a product category will not use Zone B).\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_reserve_rule%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/12.0/stock_reserve_rule>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
