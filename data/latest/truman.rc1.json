Then:\n\n```\npip install truman\n```\n\n### Editable install from source\n\nYou can also clone the truman Git repository directly. This is useful when\nyou're working on adding new environments or modifying truman itself. Clone and\ninstall in editable mode using:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/datavaluepeople/truman\ncd truman\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Background: Why truman?\n\nThe base framework that environments are built upon is OpenAI’s\n[Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).  Gym is a powerful framework for building\nenvironments and developing reinforcement learning algorithms - but Gym's\nenvironments are mostly directed towards _training_ agents on problems that can\nbe simulated exactly, e.g. playing an Atari game.  Our work at\n[datavaluepeople](https://datavaluepeople.com/) is often developing\nreinforcement learning algorithms for making a massive number of optimal\ndecisions simultaneously on high noise and changing environments, e.g. pricing\n100,000s of travel products daily, or health intervention decisions for\n1,000,000s of humans daily.  In such environments, agents should be able to\nlearn quickly and adapt to novel behaviours, since the price of testing\nalgorithms is very high.\n\nThus the suites of environments in truman are directed towards the goal of\n_large scale optimised decision making on complex systems_, and only allow\nagents a single episode to both learn and optimize on simultaneously.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.txt)\n\n\n\n",
