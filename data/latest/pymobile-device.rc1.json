    "description": "pymobiledevice is a cross-platform implementation of the mobiledevice library\nthat talks the protocols to support iPhone®, iPod Touch®, iPad® and Apple TV® devices.\n\n\npymobiledevice\n==============\n\n\nRequirements\n--------------\nPython 2.7\nM2Crypto\nConstruct\n\n\nLockdownd.py [com.apple.lockownd]\n--------------\nThis script can be used in order to pair with the device & starts other services.\n\n*/!\\ Others services can only being accessed after succesful pairing.\nSuccesful pairing requiert the device to be unlocked and user to click on\n\"Trust this device\" on its phone screen.*\n\n\nafc.py [com.apple.afc]\n--------------\nThis service is responsible for things such as copying music and photos. AFC Clients like iTunes\nare allowed accessing to a “jailed” or limited area of the device filesystem. Actually, AFC clients can\nonly access certain files, namely those located in the Media folder.\n\n\nhouse_arrest.py [com.apple.mobile.house_arrest]\n--------------\nThis service allows accessing to AppStore applications folders and their content.\nIn other words, by using an AFC client, a user/attacker can download the application resources and data.\nIt also includes the “default preferences” file where credentials are sometimes stored.\n\n\ninstallation_proxy.py [com.apple.mobile.installation_proxy]\n--------------\nThe installation proxy manages applications on a device.\nIt allows execution of the following commands:\n- List installed applications\n- List archived applications\n- ...\n\n\nmobilebackup.py & mobilebackup2.py [ com.apple.mobilebackup & com.apple.mobilebackup2 ]\n--------------\nThose services are used by iTunes to backup the device.\n\n\ndiagnostics_relay.py [com.apple.mobile.diagnostics_relay]\n--------------\nThe diagnostic relay allows requesting iOS diagnostic information.\nThe service handles the following actions:\n- [ Sleep ]Puts the device into deep sleep mode and disconnects from host.\n- [ Restart ] Restart the device and optionally show a user notification.\n- [ Shutdown ] Shutdown of the device and optionally show a user notification.\n- [ NAND, IORegistry, GasGauge, MobileGestalt ] Querry diagnostic informations.\n- ...\n\n\nfilerelay.py [com.apple.mobile.file_relay]\n--------------\nDepending of the iOS version, the file relay service may support the following commands:\n    Accounts, AddressBook, AppleSupport, AppleTV, Baseband, Bluetooth, CrashReporter, CLTM\n    Caches, CoreLocation, DataAccess, DataMigrator, demod, Device-o-Matic, EmbeddedSocial, FindMyiPhone\n    GameKitLogs, itunesstored, IORegUSBDevice, HFSMeta, Keyboard, Lockdown, MapsLogs, MobileAsset,\n    MobileBackup, MobileCal, MobileDelete, MobileInstallation, MobileMusicPlayer, MobileNotes, NANDDebugInfo\n    Network, Photos, SafeHarbor, SystemConfiguration, tmp, Ubiquity, UserDatabases, VARFS, VPN, Voicemail\n    WiFi, WirelessAutomation.\n\nAll the files returned by the iPhone are stored in clear text in a gziped CPIO archive.\n\n\npcapd.py [com.apple.pcapd]\n--------------\nStarting iOS 5, apple added a remote virtual interface (RVI) facility that allows mirroring networks trafic from an iOS device.\nOn Mac OSX the virtual interface can be enabled with the rvictl command. This script allows to use this service on other systems.\n\n\nInstalltion in mac:\n\nenv LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib\" CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include\" SWIG_FEATURES=\"-cpperraswarn -includeall -I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include\" pip install -e ~/Downloads/m2crypto-python3-b881ec842488a4325c197d735612c8db8919ed7c/",
