    "description": "============\n PythonCard\n============\n\n---------------------------------\n (a.k.a ``JavaCard`` under PyPi)\n---------------------------------\n\nThis is a pure python version of the javacard operating system as\nfound on javacard smartcards.\n\nIt does not provides much on his own beside the functionnalities of the\nOperating System, as such, it is often used in combination with others\nprojects like CAPRunner_ (linked via .CAP files) or WebSCard_ (through\nCAPRunner or python versions of Applets).\n\nDocumentation on this project is better found as original JavaCard\ndocumentation (ask Google). The goal is to replication the exact same\nfunctionnalities. If your experience is other, please fill in a `bug\nreport`_. Please do the same for missing functionnalities. As for now,\nI only implemented the functionnalities I was needing during my\nvarious tests.\n\nTo **use it**, when writing your Applet, just replace the following\nJava construction::\n\n    import javacard.framework.Applet;\n\nwith::\n\n    from pythoncard.framework import Applet\n\nAs, so far I know, the javacard version are backward compatible, the\ngoal is to provide a classic 3.0.1 version, while maintaining\ncompatiblity with earlier version like 2.1.2.\n\nPythonCard is dependant on pyDes_ and pyCrypto_ for cryptographic\noperations. The rest of the functionnalities will however work without\nthose packages installed.\n\nTo **install it**, either put the necessary directories in your\n``PYTHONPATH``, or install it via PyPi_::\n\n    $ pip install JavaCard \n\n.. _CAPRunner: https://bitbucket.org/benallard/caprunner\n.. _WebSCard: https://bitbucket.org/benallard/webscard\n.. _`bug report`: https://bitbucket.org/benallard/pythoncard/issues\n.. _pyDes: http://twhiteman.netfirms.com/des.html\n.. _pyCrypto: https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/\n.. _PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/JavaCard",
