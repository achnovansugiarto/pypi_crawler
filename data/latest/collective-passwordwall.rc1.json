    "description": "# Passwordwall\n\nThis puts your Plone site behind a login, without actually logging in a Plone user.\n\n\n## Use case\n\nThis is intended for use on public websites, so \"Published\" in Plone workflow\nterminology, where you want to restrict access because the site isn't meant to\nbe open to the public yet.\n\nIt enables people to view the site as as an anonymous user (in the Plone\nsense), so without having to log in into Plone.\n\nIt is not intended for intranets, and other sites where login is required\nanyway. In that case, this product is either not necessary, or you're better\noff using iw.rejectanonymous.\n\n\n### Plain text\n\nThe site password is stored internally as plain text. Do not use your personal\nsuper secure password here, because we intended it to be used by several\npeople.\n\nThe password should be easy to look up and communicate, which is why we store\nit in plain text.\n\nIf you have a different use case for this product where you want a different\nbehaviour: We *do* welcome pull requests!\n\n\n## Alternatives\n\nYou might also achieve this with:\n- web server Basic Auth\n- IP restriction\n\nBut if your hosting setup is such that that isn't an option,\nthis package might help.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nGo to the Plone control panel, to the \"Security\" tab.\n\nYou will see a checkbox \"Site behind password\". Check it to activate the passwordwall.\nThis means users will need to supply credentials before they can use the site.\n\nUsers that are already logged in as Plone users are not asked for credentials.\n\nThe password can be set by the \"Password\" field.\nThis is what people have to type in the \"password\" box in the dialog to get access.\n\n\n### Picking a password\n\nIt's recommended to not use dictionary words as is, nor should you use other\nwell known phrases as passwords. This is because their MD5 hashes (which we\nstore as the cookie value) would easily reveal the password. Just mixing in a\ncouple of numbers or other characters should make for a fine password.\nTry it on https://isc.sans.edu/tools/reversehash.html if you're not sure.\n\n\n### Changing the password\n\nWhen you change the password, existing cookies will be invalid, because the\npassword hash changed. People without Plone accounts (or who are logged out\nfrom Plone) will be forced to re-enter the credentials.\n\n\n## Thank you\n\n- Ingeniweb for iw.rejectanonymous, some of whose code this product copied.\n  All spelling mistakes are also their fault.\n",
