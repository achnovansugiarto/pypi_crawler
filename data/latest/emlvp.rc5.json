    "description": "# EMLvp (validator and parser)\n\n![EMLvp](https://github.com/PASTAplus/EMLvp/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg) ![RTD](https://readthedocs.org/projects/emlvp/badge/?version=latest)\n\nSee [this documentation](https://emlvp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on \"Read the Docs\".\n\n## Introduction\n\n**EMLvp** is a Python 3 library to validate and parse Ecological Metadata Language XML documents for compliance with\nthe EML metadata standard. See the\n[EML normative documentation](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/validation-and-content-references.html) for reference.\n\nThe **EMLvp** package is both a command line interface (CLI) application that can be used in a local environment and an\nEML validation and parsing API that may be imported into other Python modules. The CLI application, `emlvp`, is also\nused as a reference implementation for the emlvp API. The EMLvp package API provides three object classes that 1)\nperform XML schema validation - `Validator`, 2) EML compliance parsing - `Parser`, and 3) dereference EML \n`<references>` elements into their normalized structures  - `Derefencer`.\n\nCompliance includes the following inspections:\n 1.  `id` attributes in all elements are unique,\n 2.  `references` elements for subject `id`,\n 3.  for circular `references` (`references` parent elements with `id` attributes),\n 4.  for `system` attribute consistency,\n 5.  `customUnit` for STMML definitions,\n 6.  parents of `annotation` elements for subject `id` (sans the annotations element),\n 7.  `references` attribute of annotation(s) for subject id, and\n 8.  `additionalMetadata` `describes` attribute for subject id.\n\nThe `emlvp` application accepts an Ecological Metadata Language XML document file as input or a directory containing\nEML XML document files with a “.xml” file extension. Once an EML XML document is identified, the application will\nimmediately perform a schema validation inspection followed by EML compliance parsing that verifies the\ndocument is compliant with rules that go beyond what is possible with XML schema validation (see above).\n\n## Installation\n\n**EMLvp** may be install using pip: `pip install emlvp`. You may also install from GitHub by cloning the repository\nand then using pip to install **EMLvp** with `setup.py`. The `emlvp` command line application is installed as part\nof the pip installation, as are the XML schema files for EML 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.2.0. **EMPvp** is dependent on the\nfollowing Python packages: `Python` >= 3.10, `lxml` >= 4.9.2, `click` >= 8.1.3, and `daiquiri` >= 3.0.0.\n\n## Quickstart Guide\n\n**EMLvp** can be used directly on the command line with the `emlvp` application or embedded into another Python\nproject. Its purpose is to inspect and analyze an EML XML metadata document to ensure it complies with both schema and\nnon-schema requirements. `emlvp` simply follows a three step analysis:\n\n 1. Perform schema validation.\n 2. Parse and inspect the document for non-schema requirements (above).\n 3. If requested, dereference the \"references/ids\" of the EML and repeat steps 1 and 2.\n\nIf at any point during the analysis an error occurs, `emlvp` will either report the error and exit immediately\n(fail-fast) or continue to analyze the document and collect all additional errors until the end of the analysis,\nat which time the errors are reported (fail-slow). The `emlvp` help provides the following description:\n\n```\nUsage: emlvp [OPTIONS] TARGET...\n\n  Performs validation of EML XML file(s)\n\n      1. XML schema validation\n      2. EML parsing for references/id resolution\n      3. Dereference references/id into expanded EML XML and re-validate/parse\n\n      TARGET: EML XML file or directory containing EML XML file(s) (may be repeated)\n\nOptions:\n  -d, --dereference   Dereference EML XML file(s) (default is False).\n  -f, --fail-fast     Exit on first exception encountered (default is False).\n  -p, --pretty-print  Pretty print output for dereferenced EML XML (default is\n                      False).\n  -s, --statistics    Show post processing inspection statistics.\n  -v, --verbose       Send output to standard out (-v or -vv or -vvv for\n                      increasing output).\n  --version           Output emlvp version and exit.\n  -h, --help          Show this message and exit.\n```\n\nAs noted above, the \"TARGET\" argument may be one or more space separate EML XML files or a directory containing many\nEML XML files (these files must end with the \".xml\" extension). For example:\n\n```\n > emlvp edi.1252.1.xml\n edi.1252.1.xml\n Missing custom unit id(s): ['total abundance', 'logarithmic']\n```\n\nIf no errors are found, `emlvp` ends quietly and with no fanfare.\n\nTo use **EMLvp** in your own Python project, you would need to \"import\" the necessary class module and perform the\nappropriate analysis against the EML XML document. For example::\n\n```Python\n >>> import emlvp.validator as validator\n >>> from emlvp.validator import Validator\n >>>\n >>> with open(\"edi.1252.1.xml\", \"r\") as f:\n ...     xml = f.read()\n ...\n >>> schema_path = validator.schema_path()\n >>> v = Validator(schema_path + \"/EML2.2.0/xsd/eml.xsd\")\n >>> v.validate(xml)\n >>>\n >>> from emlvp.parser import Parser\n >>> p = Parser()\n >>> p.parse(xml)\n Traceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n   File \"/home/user/anaconda3/envs/emlvp/lib/python3.10/site-packages/emlvp/parser.py\", line 185, in parse\n     raise exceptions.ParseError(msg_queue.strip())\n emlvp.exceptions.ParseError: Missing custom unit id(s): ['logarithmic', 'total abundance']\n >>>\n```\n\nApplications that use the API should rely on exceptions to indicate an error has occurred in either validation or\nparsing of the EML XML document.\n\n## EMLvp Class API\n\n### Validator:\n\n```Python\nclass Validator(object):\n  \"\"\"\n  Validates an EML XML document for being well formed and schema syntax correct.\n  \"\"\"\n\ndef __init__(self, schema: str):\n  \"\"\"\n  Class init method.\n  :param schema: path to root schema eml.xsd\n  \"\"\"\n\ndef validate(self, xml: str):\n  \"\"\"\n  Validates an EML XML document instance\n  :param xml: EML XML document instance as a unicode string\n  :return: None\n  :raises emlvp.exceptions.ValidationError: Raises ValidationError on any invalid content found\n  \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Parser:\n\n```Python\nclass Parser(object):\n   \"\"\"\n   Parses an EML XML document instance inspecting for non-schema related issues. See here for possible\n   issues: https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/validation-and-content-references.html\n   \"\"\"\n\ndef __init__(self, fail_fast: bool = False):\n   \"\"\"\n   Class init method.\n   :param fail_fast: Boolean to indicate whether parsing should fail immediately\n   \"\"\"\n\ndef parse(self, xml: str):\n   \"\"\"\n   Parses an EML XML document instance inspecting for non-schema related issues.\n   :param xml: EML XML document instance as a unicode string\n   :return: None\n   :raises emlvp.exceptions.ParseError: Raises ParseError on any invalid content found\n   \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Derferencer:\n\n```Python\nclass Dereferencer(object):\n   \"\"\"\n   Expands EML XML content by dereferencing \"references\" element to content defined\n   by the \"id\" attribute of a source element.\n   \"\"\"\n\ndef __init__(self, pretty_print=False):\n   \"\"\"\n   Class init method.\n   :param pretty_print: Boolean to indicate if dereferenced EML XML is formatted for viewing\n   \"\"\"\n\ndef dereference(self, xml: str) -> str:\n   \"\"\"\n   Dereferences an EML XML document instance.\n   :param xml: EML XML document instance as a unicode string.\n   :return str: Expanded EML XML.\n   \"\"\"\n```\n",
