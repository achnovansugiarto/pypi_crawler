    "description": "======\nlpmqtt\n======\n\nlpmqtt, like its name implies, is a tool for publish a launchpad event stream\ninto MQTT. It will publish all the capture events from the lp emails over imap\nand publish them to MQTT\n\nMQTT Topics\n===========\nlpmqtt will push launchpad events to topics broken by project and event type.\nThe formula used is::\n\n  <base topic>/<project>/<bugs, blueprints, or other event type>/<bug number>\n\nHowever only the base topic is a guaranteed field. Depending on the emails sent\nby launchpad some of the other fields may not be present. In those cases the\ntopic will start from the base topic and will use fields moving towards the\nright until one is missing.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\nThere are a few required pieces of information to make lpmqtt work properly.\nThese settings are specified in the config file.\n\nIMAP\n----\nTo configure lpmqtt to listen to your imap server you need to provide 3 pieces\nof information in the *[imap]* section\n\n * **hostname** - The hostname for the imap server to connect to\n * **username** - The username to connect with\n * **password** - The password to use\n\nThere are also a number of optional settings you can use depending on the\nconfiguration of the imap server you're connecting to:\n\n * **use_ssl** - Set this to *True* to establish an imaps connection with ssl\n * **folder** - Specify a mailbox/folder to watch for message from launchpad.\n                If one is not specified *INBOX* will be used\n * **delete-old** - Set this to *True* to have lpmqtt delete messages after it\n                    finishes processing them. By default it will just mark them\n                    as read.\n\nMQTT\n----\nJust as with imap there are a few required options for talking to MQTT, which\nis the other axis of communication in lpmqtt. The options for configuring MQTT\ncommunication go in the *[mqtt]* section. The 2 required options are:\n\n * **hostname** - The hostname for the MQTT broker\n * **base_topic** - The base topic name to use for the gerrit events\n\nThere are also a couple optional settings for communicating with mqtt that you\ncan set:\n\n * **port** - The port to communicate to the MQTT broker on. By default this\n              is set to 1883, the default MQTT port. This only needs to be set\n              if your broker uses a non-default port.\n * **keepalive** - Used to set the keepalive time for connections to the MQTT\n                   broker. By default this is set to 60 seconds.\n * **username** - Used to set the auth username to connect to the MQTT broker\n                  with.\n * **password** - Used to set the auth password to connect to the MQTT broker\n                  with. A username must be set for this option to be used.",
