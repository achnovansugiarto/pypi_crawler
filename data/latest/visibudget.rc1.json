It isn't concerned with double-entry accounting (though it does\nthis behind the scenes), nor does it try to do everything for you. Instead, VisiBudget helps you to visualize the effect\nof spending your money on your paycheck so you always know how much money you have and what it can be used for.\n\nIf you have ever used another budget management system, you've probably seen that they either get very complicated very\nquickly, trying to make everything \"easy\" for you, or they leave all the hard work up to you. VisiBudget only tries to\nhelp you keep track of the money coming in, what account it goes into, where it goes out later and when, and how much\nyou have spent and have left over. Your spending is mapped out on a calendar so you can easily see how much you will\nhave on a given date and how far you've progressed towards your savings goals.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install VisiBudget, simply use `pipenv <http://pipenv.org/>`_ (or pip, of course):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pipenv install visibudget\n\nHow to Contribute\n-----------------\n\n#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is a `good first issue`_ tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very familiar with the codebase yet.\n#. Fork `the repository`_ on GitHub to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).\n#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.\n#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.\n\n.. _`the repository`: http://github.com/deriamis/visibudget\n.. _`good first issue`: https://github.com/deriamis/visibudget/issues?direction=desc&labels=good+first+issue&page=1&sort=updated&state=open\n\nThanks!\n-------\n\nThe skeleton for this project borrows heavily from work already done by\n`Kenneth Reitz`_. I would have had a much tougher time putting this\ntogether if he hadn't already done a lot of it already. If you `thank me`_\nfor this project, please also `thank Kenneth`_ as well!\n\n.. _`Kenneth Reitz`: https://www.kennethreitz.org/\n.. _`thank me`: https://saythanks.io/to/deriamis\n.. _`thank Kenneth`: https://saythanks.io/to/kennethreitz\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nRelease History\n---------------\n\n0.1.0 (2019-01-04)\n------------------\n\nInitial commits, laying out the project structure.",
