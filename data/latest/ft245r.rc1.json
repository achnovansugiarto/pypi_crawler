    "description": "# relay_ft245r\n\n*relay_ft245r* is a Python module to control relay boards based on the \nFTDI FT245R chip. A popular example is the Sainsmart USB relay board.\n\n# How to use *relay_ft245r*\n\nExample code:\n\n```python\nimport relay_ft245r\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nrb = relay_ft245r.FT245R()\ndev_list = rb.list_dev()\n\n# list of FT245R devices are returned\nif len(dev_list) == 0:\n    print('No FT245R devices found')\n    sys.exit()\n    \n# Show their serial numbers\nfor dev in dev_list:\n    print(dev.serial_number)\n\n# Pick the first one for simplicity\ndev = dev_list[0]\nprint('Using device with serial number ' + str(dev.serial_number))\n\n# Connect and turn on relay 2 and 4, and turn off\nrb.connect(dev)\nrb.switchon(2)    \nrb.switchon(4)\ntime.sleep(1.0)\nrb.switchoff(2)    \ntime.sleep(1.0)\nrb.switchoff(4)\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nThere's no need to \"install\" *relay_ft245r.py*. Just put it in the same\ndirectory as the Python program that will call it.\n\nBut it does need PyUSB and, for Linux, a udev rule to be added or \nWindows, the libusb-win32 driver to be installed and configured.\n\n## Installing PyUSB\n\nrelay_ft245r uses the PyUSB Python module to control USB devices. To add \nto your base Python installation, do:\n\n```bash\nsudo pip install pyusb\n```\n\n## Linux: Update udev rules\n\nTo control USB devices without having to be the root user, two things \nare required: 1) you must be part of the \"plugdev\" group, and 2) the \nFTDI device has to be part of the \"plugdev\" group.\n\n### Adding user to plugdev\n\nCheck which groups your user login belongs to:\n\n```bash\ngroups\n```\n\nIf this list includes \"plugdev\", go on to the next step. Othewise, do \nthis command except replace <user> with your user name:\n\n```bash\nsudo addgroup <user> plugdev\n```\n\n### Adding a udev rule\n\nAdd a file called */lib/udev/rules.d/60-relay_ft245r.rules* with the \ncontents below. This example uses nano editor:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /lib/udev/rules.d/60-relay_ft245r.rules\n```\n\nEnter the text below as a single line:\n\n```\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0403\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"6001\", GROUP=\"plugdev\", MODE=\"660\", ENV{MODALIAS}=\"ignore\"\n```\n\nUnplug **All** FTDI devices from USB and reattach so that this new rule \nis executed for each FTDI device.\n\n## Windows: Add libusb-win32 and configure\n\nOn Windows, PyUSB calls into the libusb-win32 driver. \n\n### Install Zadig\n\nZadig is the easiest way in Windows to install libusb-win32 and select\nit as the driver assigned to the FT245R board. Go to \nhttp://zadig.akeo.ie/ and download and install Zadig.\n\n* Run the program\n* Click on \"Options\" and then \"Show All Devices\"\n* Back on the main dialog, select \"FT245R USB FIFO\" in the dropdown\n* Confirm that USB ID shows **0403** and **6001**\n* In the pick list specify \"libusb-win32\"\n* Click on the Replace Driver button\n* Answer any popup dialogs that show up\n\nThis replaces WinUSB for libusb-win32 as the driver to control the board. The \ndialog should look like this before you press *Replace Driver*:\n\n![Zadig dialog](images/Zadig_Replace_Driver.png)\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## ValueError: The device has no langid\n\nThis error happens in Linux when the program does not have permission to \naccess the port. (The error is a side effect and is misleading.) Fix the \nudev rule as documented above.\n\nTo confirm it is a user permission issue, try using *sudo* in front of \nthe command to run as superuser. If it works, then it is a permissions \nissue with the device.\n\nSometimes, you need to reboot the computer; logging in and out doesn't \nseem to set the new user permissions.\n\n## usb.core.USBError: [[Errno 16]] Resource busy\n\nCannot take control of the USB device. Many possible causes:\n\n* The device is attached to another driver (for example, if you are \n  running a virtual machine and the device is presently connected to that \n  virtual machine)\n\n## TypeError: unbound method ... must be called with...\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nrb = relay_ft245r.FT245R()\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nrb = relay_ft245r.FT245R\n```\n\nThe second one calls out the object template instead of an object instance.\n\n# Origins\n\nThe original code for this came from https://github.com/xypron/pyrelayctl\nauthored by Heinrich Schuchardt.\n\nI made these changes:\n\n1. Cleaner implementation as object oriented code (didn't need to keep \npassing the device handle)\n\n2. Made it compatible with Python on Windows\n\n3. Fixed a race condition. On Windows, PyUSB runs slow and the relays\nwhere not set reliably on some boards. Probably the bit\nmasking is not reliable (the USB readstatus() may be happening before\nthe previous USB write happened) so I restructured the code to only\nread the relay state once on connect().\n\nThis was tested on Linux Mint 18.3 (Debian) and Windows 7 Professional. It \nshould work fine on Raspberry Pi (Debian) and Windows 10, etc.\n\n# License\n\n```\n# Copyright (c) 2016, Heinrich Schuchardt <xypron.glpk@gmx.de>\n# Copyright (c) 2018, Vince Patron <vince@patronweb.com>\n# All rights reserved.\n#\n# Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n# modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n#\n#     * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n#   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n#\n#     * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n#   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n#   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n#\n# THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\n# AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n# IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\n# ARE DISCLAIMED.
