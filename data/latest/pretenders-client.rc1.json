    "description": "An Introduction to Pretenders\n=============================\n\nThe ``pretenders`` project creates flexible fakes for external network\nservices. These external services can be faked by setting pre-canned answers,\ndefining expectations, or just querying them on received data after [test]\nexecution.\n\nThey are loosely designed along the pattern of Record/Replay/Verify.\n\n\nPython Compatibility\n--------------------\n\nThe server side of Pretenders is written in Python3:\n\n* Because we firmly believe all new projects should use Python3, unless\n  there are *very* compelling reasons against it.\n* Because since these will be run as standalone servers, compatibility\n  is not such an issue\n\nIn the cases we implement a client, we will be making this runnable in\nPython 3.x and Python 2.6/2.7.\n\n\nMocked Servers Available\n------------------------\n\nPretenders currently supports the mocking of HTTP and SMTP servers.\n\nFuture services we are considering to support include AMQP and ssh.\n\nThese represent the vast majority of the services that the software we\nwrite interacts with.\n\nSome example use cases include:\n\n* Mocking external HTTP-based APIs at the wire level in module integration\n  tests\n* Facilitating the manual testing and debugging of front-end Ajax code\n  where the back-end has not been developed yet\n* Writing fully automated tests for any system that sends email, and\n  where we want to easily verify outgoing mails\n\nPretenders provides a unified RESTful API to verify the interactions of\nour code with external services, regardless of the service protocol.\n\npretenders.client.http - HTTP server\n------------------------------------\n\nTypical usage is to mock RESTful/SOAP APIs of external services.\n\nThis will normally require pre-programming the service with responses,\nand enquiring the service later about received requests. This can be done\nwith specialised assertions / matchers, or by setting expectations and\nverifying fulfilment of such expectations.\n\nThe pre-programming step may be done by using specific proprietary HTTP\nheaders, or by using an alternative HTTP port to the one used for mocking.\n\nFor example usage see the `documentation`_.\n\n.. _`documentation`: http://pretenders.readthedocs.org/\n\nImplementation is based on the ``bottle`` web microframework.\n\nOne of our goals will be that the wire protocol is simple enough that you do\nnot need any specialised client. That said, we will be providing client\nlibraries (at least one in Python) to simplify interacting with the server,\nand to provide a comfortable API to use in tests.\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nFor discussions about the usage, development, and future of pretenders, please\njoin the `pretenders`_ mailing list.\n\n.. _`pretenders`: http://groups.google.com/group/pretenders-project\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFull documentation of the project can be found here:\n\nhttp://pretenders.readthedocs.org/\n\nContributing\n============\n\nPretenders welcomes contributions in any form - be it pull requests, adding an\nissue or feedback via `github`_ or sending a message on the `pretenders`_\nmailing list so don't be shy!\n\nWe have the following branching convention:\n\n    - master: This should look exactly like the latest release.\n    - develop: This is where ongoing work lands, only being merged into master\n      at release point.\n\nIn order to contribute, fork the repo in `github`_ and branch from the develop\nbranch. Create your PRs into develop in the main repo.\n\n.. _`github`: https://github.com/pretenders/pretenders\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\n``build.sh`` runs the full suite of tests, as well as building the sphinx docs\nand checking for pep8 errors.",
