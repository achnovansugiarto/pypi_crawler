Use the one that is canonical for your distribution, for example: `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`.\n\nFor macOS, it is recommend to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). For windows, something like [chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) will do.\n\n### Python Interpreter\nYou need to install python 3.10. See <https://www.python.org/downloads/> for download instructions.\nOn macOS, you can use homebrew as well:\n```bash\nbrew install python@3.10\n```\n\n## Install with `pip` from PyPI.\n\n`pip install sora-device-client`\n\n## Install a development version.\n\nSee DEVELOPMENT.md for info on installing from source / CI build.\n\n# Command-Line Client\n\n## Configuration file\nCopy the default config file to the appropriate location. `sora` will tell you where it should go:\n\n```sh\nsora paths\n# Example output:\n# Configuration folder: (your config.toml needs to go in here)\n#     /home/jwhitaker/.config/sora-device-client\n#\n# Data folder: (other runtime data gets stored in here)\n#     /home/jwhitaker/.local/share/sora-device-client\n```\n\n`sora` will also give you an example configuration:\n```sh\nsora example-config\n# ==============================================================================\n# Sora Device Client configuration\n# ==============================================================================\n#\n# ...\n#\n```\n\nPutting them together, you can set up a config file in the right location, and edit it:\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p /home/jwhitaker/.config/sora-device-client/ # (configuration folder from `sora paths`)\nsora example-config > /home/jwhitaker/.config/sora-device-client/config.toml\nnotepad /home/jwhitaker/.config/sora-device-client/config.toml # or whatever\n```\n\nYou will most likely have to edit the `[location.driver]` section to work with the location source for your system.\n\nIf you are connecting to a GNSS location source over the network, it will be something like:\n```toml\n[location.driver.tcp]\nhost = \"localhost\"\nport = 55555\n```\nHowever if you are connecting over a serial or USB port:\n```toml\n[location.driver.serial]\nport = \"/dev/tty.usbmodem14401\"\nbaud = 115200\n```\nThe value of `port` will be highly hardware specific. Some values that are known to have worked are: `/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/tty.usbmodem14401`.\nIf you have Swift hardware and have installed the Swift Console: https://support.swiftnav.com/support/solutions/articles/44001903699-installing-swift-console, the value used to connect it to your swift device will work.\n\nAlso note that sometimes non privileged users do not have permission to read and write to the device. The easiest way to obtain these permissions is to add your user to the group of the device. For example if it is `/dev/ttyACM0`, the group to add yourself to may be obtained with:\n```bash\nstat -c \"%G\" /dev/ttyACM0\n```\nSee [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/users_and_groups#Other_examples_of_user_management) for how to add a user to a group on Linux. You may need to log out of and log in to the operating system session again. On macOS and Windows, the instructions are too varied to list here. Please research how to do this for your combination of OS and OS version.\n\n## Running\n\n```\nOnce installed, the `sora` command will be in the path:\n```bash\nsora --help\n```\n\n### Login\nTo authenticate with a sora server, run\n```bash\nsora login\n```\nand follow the interactive procedure. You will need access to a web browser.\n\n### Start\nAfter authentication, you can stream data to the sora server with\n```bash\nsora --verbose start\n```\n\n### Logout\nIf you wish to use a difference set of credentials on the same hardware, you can clear them with\n```bash\nsora logout\n```\n\n## Data file\nThere is also a data file called `data.toml` that is used to store data that is generated by `sora login`. Typically, running `sora logout` will clear this file.\nIf you need to manually remove it, its location is is the `Data path` location from the output of\n\n```sh\nsora paths\n```\n",
