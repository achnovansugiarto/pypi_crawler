First, you need to get your `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and redirect uri. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGm4jALukM) is a video created by Spotipy that explains how to do so.\n\n2. Declare a `SpotifyAPI` object that allows you to access data from Spotify.\n\n3. Declare a `Data` object to store all the songs which you want to plot. You can add individual or multiple tracks, albums, or playlists at a time.\n\n4. Determine the kind of data you want to plot:\n\n   - Category plots (bar charts, pie charts) allow you to plot songs by groups (i.e. artists or albums).\n   - Audio Feature Plots allow you to plot songs by their audio features.\n\n5. If you need to look up the Spotify ids of tracks, albums, artists, or playlists, you can use the `search_id` (for general searches) or `my_id` (for user-specific playlists) functions.\n\nHere is an example analyzing Spotify's \"This is Radiohead\" playlist:\n\n```\nimport spotifyapi\nimport data\nimport plots.audiofeatures as af\nimport plots.category as c\n\nsp = spotifyapi.SpotifyApi(\n    \"234645624be5451eb959f0af3d9e00ac\",\n    \"a1425a973e8d4574a0dfbd3c9e20438f\",\n    \"https://localhost:8888/callback\",\n)\n\nd = data.Data(sp)\n\n# add tracks from the \"This is Radiohead\" playlist\nd.add_playlist(\"37i9dQZF1DZ06evO2VxlyE\")\n\n# view data about the tracks' audio features\nafp = af.AudioFeaturesPlot(sp, d.get_data(), [\"energy\", \"loudness\"])\n\n# scatter plot of energy vs. loudness of the tracks in the playlist\nafp.scatter_plot_2d(color=\"album\")\n\n# box plot of the tracks' energy values, grouped by album\nafp.box_plot([\"energy\"], groupby=\"album\")\n\n\ncp = c.CategoryPlot(d.get_data())\n\n# pie chart of albums in the playlist\ncp.pie_chart()\n\n```\n\nThis code produces the following plots:\n![](/examples/radiohead_scatter_plot.png)\n![](/examples/radiohead_box_plot.png)\n![](/examples/radiohead_pie_chart.png)\n",
