    "description": ".. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-purple.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/Dennis-van-Gils/python-dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n\nDvG_PyQtGraph_Monkeypatch\n=========================\n*Monkeypatch for pyqtgraph==0.11.0 resulting in superior OpenGL performance in contrast to more recent 0.11.1 to 0.12.3*\n\nThis monkeypatch is safe to import and will only get applied when it detects the\ncorrect PyQtGraph version `pyqtgraph == 0.11.0`. For other versions it will\nnot affect anything at all. Also, when not using OpenGL in experimental mode,\nnothing changes. \n\n- Github: https://github.com/Dennis-van-Gils/python-dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch\n- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch\n\nInstallation::\n\n    pip install dvg-pyqtgraph-monkeypatch\n\nReason for monkeypatch\n======================\n\nThis patch is intended for PyQtGraph with OpenGL acceleration enabled as such: ::\n\n    import pyqtgraph as pg\n    import OpenGL.GL as gl  # pylint: disable=unused-import\n    pg.setConfigOptions(useOpenGL=True)\n    pg.setConfigOptions(enableExperimental=True)\n    pg.setConfigOptions(antialias=True)\n\nAbove code will enable OpenGL acceleration within PyQtGraph and adds\nanti-aliasing to the chart curves. However, from versions `0.11.0` to `0.12.2`\nit will not draw the linewidth of the curves correctly and they remain at 1\npixel width, regardless of the set linewidth. This patch fixes the linewidth\nissue.\n\nWhy do I fix the PyQtgraph version for this monkeypatch to `0.11.0`? Several\nreasons:\n\n    - `0.11.0` draws the axis tick labels at the borders of the\n      `pyqtgraph.PlotWidget` nicely, without cutting them off mid-way of the\n      label itself. From `0.11.1` and up the tick labels will be cut off when\n      they are at the border. That can be very confusing when reading the graph.\n\n    - The most recent version at time of writing (`0.12.3`) actually has fixed\n      the linewidth issue. However, the previous problem on the tick labels still\n      applies.\n\n    - It appears that `0.11.0` has superior plotting performance in frames per\n      second / CPU load in contrast to `0.12.0` and up. This was confirmed and\n      tested in another of my projects https://github.com/Dennis-van-Gils/DvG_Arduino_lock-in_amp.\n      There is a different method used to render the graphs in OpenGL in these\n      more recent PyQtGraph versions.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nYou only have to import the module into your Python code after you have imported\nPyQtGraph. That's all. The patch will then be applied automatically. ::\n\n    import dvg_monkeypatch_pyqtgraph  # pylint: disable=unused-import\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n2.0.0 (2022-01-20)\n------------------\n* Turned into a separate PyPi package with proper documentation.\n\n1.0.0 (?)\n------------------\n* First but unreleased version. Was bundled together with every separate\n  project instead.\n\n\n",
