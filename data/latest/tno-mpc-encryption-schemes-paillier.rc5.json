    "description": "# TNO MPC Lab - Encryption Schemes - Paillier\n\nThe TNO MPC lab consists of generic software components, procedures, and functionalities developed and maintained on a regular basis to facilitate and aid in the development of MPC solutions. The lab is a cross-project initiative allowing us to integrate and reuse previously developed MPC functionalities to boost the development of new protocols and solutions.\n\nThe package tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier is part of the TNO Python Toolbox.\n\nImplementation of the Paillier encryption scheme with support for the following:\n- Positive and negative numbers, as well as fixed point encoding of numbers.\n- Homomorphic addition of ciphertexts, negation of ciphertexts, and multiplication of ciphertexts with integral scalars.\n- Precomputation of the randomness needed for refreshing / generating fresh encryptions.\n- Custom class of warnings for making cryptographic suggestions to the developer.\n\n*Limitations in (end-)use: the content of this software package may solely be used for applications that comply with international export control laws.*  \n*This implementation of cryptographic software has not been audited. Use at your own risk.*\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation of the tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier package can be found [here](https://docs.mpc.tno.nl/encryption_schemes/paillier/2.1.1).\n\n## Install\n\nEasily install the tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier package using pip:\n```console\n$ python -m pip install tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier\n```\n\n### Note:\nA significant performance improvement can be achieved by installing the GMPY2 library.\n```console\n$ python -m pip install 'tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier[gmpy]'\n```\n\nIf you wish to use the tno.mpc.communication module you can use:\n```console\n$ python -m pip install 'tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier[communication]'\n```\n\nIf you wish to run the tests you can use:\n```console\n$ python -m pip install 'tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier[tests]'\n```\n\n## Basic usage\n\nBasic usage is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier import Paillier\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # initialize Paillier with key_length of 2048 bits and fixed point precision of 3 decimals\n    paillier_scheme = Paillier.from_security_parameter(key_length=2048, precision=3)\n    # encrypt the number 8.1\n    ciphertext1 = paillier_scheme.encrypt(8.1)\n    # add 0.9 to the original plaintext\n    ciphertext1 += 0.9\n    # multiply the original plaintext by 10\n    ciphertext1 *= 10\n    # encrypt the number 10\n    ciphertext2 = paillier_scheme.encrypt(10)\n    # add both encrypted numbers together\n    encrypted_sum = ciphertext1 + ciphertext2\n    # ...communication...\n    # decrypt the encrypted sum to 100\n    decrypted_sum = paillier_scheme.decrypt(encrypted_sum)\n    assert decrypted_sum == 100\n```\n\nRunning this example will show several warnings. The remainder of this documentation explains why the warnings are issued and how to get rid of them depending on the users' preferences.\n\n## Fresh and unfresh ciphertexts\n\nAn encrypted message is called a ciphertext. A ciphertext in the current package has a property `is_fresh` that indicates whether this ciphertext has fresh randomness, in which case it can be communicated to another player securely. More specifically, a ciphertext `c` is fresh if another user, knowledgeable of all prior communication and all current ciphertexts marked as fresh, cannot deduce any more private information from learning `c`.\n\nThe package understands that the freshness of the result of a homomorphic operation depends on the freshness of the inputs, and that the homomorphic operation renders the inputs unfresh. For example, if `c1` and `c2` are fresh ciphertexts, then `c12 = c1 + c2` is marked as a fresh encryption (no rerandomization needed) of the sum of the two underlying plaintexts. After the operation, ciphertexts `c1` and `c2` are no longer fresh.\n\nThe fact that `c1` and `c2` were both fresh implies that, at some point, we randomized them. After the operation `c12 = c1 + c2`, only `c12` is fresh. This implies that one randomization was lost in the process. In particular, we wasted resources. An alternative approach was to have unfresh `c1` and `c2` then compute the unfresh result `c12` and only randomize that ciphertext. This time, no resources were wasted. The package issues a warning to inform the user this and similar efficiency opportunities.\n\nThe package integrates naturally with `tno.mpc.communication` and if that is used for communication, its serialization logic will ensure that all sent ciphertexts are fresh. A warning is issued if a ciphertext was randomized in the proces. A ciphertext is always marked as unfresh after it is serialized. Similarly, all received ciphertexts are considered unfresh.\n\n## Tailor behavior to your needs\n\nThe crypto-neutral developer is facilitated by the package as follows: the package takes care of all bookkeeping, and the serialization used by `tno.mpc.communication` takes care of all randomization. The warnings can be [disabled](#warnings) for a smoother experience.\n\nThe eager crypto-youngster can improve their understanding and hone their skills by learning from the warnings that the package provides in a safe environment. The package is safe to use when combined with `tno.mpc.communication`. It remains to be safe while you transform your code from 'randomize-early' (fresh encryptions) to 'randomize-late' (unfresh encryptions, randomize before exposure). At that point you have optimized the efficiency of the library while ensuring that all exposed ciphertexts are fresh before they are serialized. In particular, you no longer rely on our serialization for (re)randomizing your ciphertexts.\n\nFinally, the experienced cryptographer can turn off warnings / turn them into exceptions, or benefit from the `is_fresh` flag for own purposes (e.g. different serializer or communication).\n\n### Warnings\n\nBy default, the `warnings` package prints only the first occurence of a warning for each location (module + line number) where the warning is issued. The user may easily [change this behaviour](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#the-warnings-filter) to never see warnings:\n\n```py\nfrom tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier import EncryptionSchemeWarning\n\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", EncryptionSchemeWarning)\n```\n\nAlternatively, the user may pass `\"once\"`, `\"always\"` or even `\"error\"`.\n\nFinally, note that some operations issue two warnings, e.g. `c1-c2` issues a warning for computing `-c2` and a warning for computing `c1 + (-c2)`.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nThe [basic usage](#basic-usage) can be improved upon by explicitly randomizing at late as possible.\n\n```python\nfrom tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.paillier import Paillier\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    paillier_scheme = Paillier.from_security_parameter(key_length=2048, precision=3)\n    # unsafe_encrypt does NOT randomize the generated ciphertext; it is deterministic still\n    ciphertext1 = paillier_scheme.unsafe_encrypt(8.1)\n    ciphertext1 += 0.9\n    ciphertext1 *= 10\n    ciphertext2 = paillier_scheme.unsafe_encrypt(10)\n    # no randomness can be wasted by adding the two unfresh encryptions\n    encrypted_sum = ciphertext1 + ciphertext2\n    # randomize the result, which is now fresh\n    encrypted_sum.randomize()\n    # ...communication...\n    decrypted_sum = paillier_scheme.decrypt(encrypted_sum)\n    assert decrypted_sum == 100\n```\n\nAs explained [above](#fresh-and-unfresh-ciphertexts), this implementation avoids wasted randomization for `encrypted_sum` and therefore is more efficient.\n\n\n\n",
