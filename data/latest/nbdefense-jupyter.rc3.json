    "description": "# nbdefense_jupyter\n\nThe NBDefense Jupyter extension\n\nThis extension is composed of a Python package named `nbdefense_jupyter`\nfor the server extension and a NPM package named `nbdefense-jupyter`\nfor the frontend extension.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- JupyterLab >= 3.0\n\n## Install\n\nTo install the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip install nbdefense_jupyter\n```\n\nIf you are planning on using the PII module you will need to install `en_core_web_trf`\n\n```bash\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_trf\n```\n\nEnable the extension\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension enable nbdefense_jupyter\n```\n\nStart (or restart) the Jupyter Lab Server\n\n```bash\njupyter lab\n```\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo remove the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall nbdefense_jupyter\n```\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check\nthat the server extension is enabled:\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension list\n```\n\nIf the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing\nthe frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development install\n\nNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.\n\nThe `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\n# Change directory to the nbdefense_jupyter directory\n# Install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode\njupyter server extension enable nbdefense_jupyter\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nBy default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=False\n```\n\n### Development uninstall\n\n```bash\n# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode\njupyter server extension disable nbdefense_jupyter\npip uninstall nbdefense_jupyter\n```\n\nIn development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`\ncommand. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`\nfolder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `nbdefense-jupyter` within that folder.\n\n### Updating the nbdefense dependency\n\n> **Note:** We should automate this process in the future\n\n1. Download the new release's wheel file from the S3 bucket\n2. Rename the release to follow this format: `nbdefense-{VERSION}-py2.py3-none-any.whl`\n3. Copy the file to the `nbdefense_cli` directory\n4. Update the dependency in the `pyproject.toml` file to match the new filename\n5. Re-run `pip install -e .`\n",
