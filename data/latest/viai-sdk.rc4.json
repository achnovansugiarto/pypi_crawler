    "description": "# VIAI-SDK\n\nA project to make working with the VIAI (https://cloud.google.com/solutions/visual-inspection-ai) REST API easier. \n\n## Design\n\nThe current pre-alpha design: ![VIAI-SDK Class Degign](img/viai-sdk.drawio.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic tasks for the VIAI SDK.\n\n### GCP Credentials\n\nYou can supply a `keyfile` parameter to supply a Service Account keyfile or specify the standard `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. \n\nIf you supply the `keyfile` parameter, it automatically sets the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the same value. \n\n### Project ID\n\nThe GCP Project ID is read from the service account keyfile.\n\n### Service Account Requirements\n\nThe following roles should be bound for the service account:\n\n* [`roles/storage.objectAdmin`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloud-storage-roles)\n* [`roles/visualinspection.editor`]()\n\n### Starting out\n\n```\n>>> from viai import VIAI\n>>> a = VIAI(keyfile='viai-key.json')\n>>> dir(a)\n['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__',\n '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', \n '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', \n '_getAuthCredentials', '_getSolutions', '_loadAllSolutions', 'apiUrl', 'author', 'credentials', 'projectId', 'region',\n  'requestHeader', 'solutions']\n```\n\n## Loading a Solution/Dataset\n\n```\n>>> from viai import VIAI\n>>> a = VIAI()\n>>> b = a.solutions[0]\n>>> b.load()\n<viai.Solution object at 0x7ff0a9497310>\n>>> b.load()\n>>> dir(b)\n['VIAI', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init_\n_', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__\nstr__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_getAnnotationSets', '_getAnnotationSpecs', '_getImages', '_getModules', '_getSolutionArtifacts', 'annotationSe\nts', 'annotationSpecs', 'apiUrl', 'createTime', 'datasetId', 'datasetUrl', 'displayName', 'images', 'load', 'log', 'modules', 'name', 'requestHeader', 'sol\nutionArtifacts', 'solutionType', 'updateTime', 'url']\n```\n\n## Working with images in a solution\n\n```\n>>> from viai import VIAI\n>>> a = VIAI(keyfile='viai-key.json')\n>>> b = a.solutions[3]\n>>> b.load()\n2022-07-25 18:05:59,922 [INFO]  Loading Solution Data- style1horizontals\n>>> c = b.images[0]\n>>> d = c.getGcsBlob()\n>>> type(d)\n<class 'google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob'>\n>>> d.public_url\n'https://storage.googleapis.com/myproejct/myimage.jpg'\n```\n## Development\n\n#### Testing and Code Coverage\n\n```\ncd viai-sdk\nPYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/src;coverage run -m nose2 -v\ncoverage report -m \n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nMerge requests are always welcome, and reach out to me at jamieduncan@google.com with ideas and questions!
