To do this, you first want to\nstart a Jupyter notebook server:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook\n```\n\nFrom the notebook list page, navigate to the pyfolio examples directory\nand open a notebook. Execute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it\nand hitting Shift+Enter.\n\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you find a bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/pyfolio-reloaded/issues) in this repository.\n\nYou can also join our [community](https://exchange.ml4trading.io).\n\n## Support\n\nPlease [open an issue](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/pyfolio-reloaded/issues/new) for support.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, a great place to look is the [issues marked with help-wanted](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/pyfolio-reloaded/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n\nFor a list of core developers and outside collaborators, see [the GitHub contributors list](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/pyfolio-reloaded/graphs/contributors).\n",
