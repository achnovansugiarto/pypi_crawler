    "description": "Flask-Admin\n===========\n\nThis is a clone of https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin for flaskpress.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nFlask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you\nadd admin interfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin* package, but implemented in such\na way that the developer has total control of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.\n\nOut-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM's, including\n\n- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,\n\n- `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_,\n\n- `pymongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_ and\n\n- `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_.\n\nIt also boasts a simple file management interface and a `redis client <http://redis.io/>`_ console.\n\nThe biggest feature of Flask-Admin is flexibility. It aims to provide a set of simple tools that can be used for\nbuilding admin interfaces of any complexity. So, to start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,\nwith auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your models. But then you can go further and customize those views & forms\nas the need arises.\n\nFlask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production ready.\n\nExamples\n--------\nSeveral usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please feel free to add your own examples, or improve\non some of the existing ones, and then submit them via GitHub as a *pull-request*.\n\nYou can see some of these examples in action at `http://examples.flask-admin.org <http://examples.flask-admin.org/>`_.\nTo run the examples on your local environment, one at a time, do something like::\n\n    cd flask-admin\n    python examples/simple/app.py\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nFlask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find all of the documentation at `https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nThe docs are auto-generated from the *.rst* files in the */doc* folder. So if you come across any errors, or\nif you think of anything else that should be included, then please make the changes and submit them as a *pull-request*.\n\nTo build the docs in your local environment, from the project directory::\n\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    sudo make html\n\nAnd if you want to preview any *.rst* snippets that you may want to contribute, go to `http://rst.ninjs.org/ <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo install Flask-Admin, simply::\n\n    pip install flask-admin\n\nOr alternatively, you can download the repository and install manually by doing::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:flask-admin/flask-admin.git\n    cd flask-admin\n    python setup.py install\n\nTests\n-----\nTest are run with *nose*. If you are not familiar with this package you can get some more info from `their website <https://nose.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nTo run the tests, from the project directory, simply::\n\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    nosetests\n\nYou should see output similar to::\n\n    .............................................\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Ran 102 tests in 13.132s\n\n    OK\n\nFor all the tests to pass successfully, you'll need Postgres & MongoDB to be running locally. For Postgres::\n\n    CREATE DATABASE flask_admin_test;\n    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n\n3rd Party Stuff\n---------------\n\nFlask-Admin is built with the help of `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.\n\nIf you want to localize your application, install the `Flask-BabelEx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-BabelEx>`_ package.\n\nYou can help improve Flask-Admin's translations through Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.4.2\n-----\n\n* Small bug fix release. Fixes regression that prevented usage of \"virtual\" columns with a custom formatter.\n\n1.4.1\n-----\n\n* Official Python 3.5 support\n* Customizable row actions\n* Tablib support (exporting to XLS, XLSX, CSV, etc)\n* Updated external dependencies (jQuery, x-editable, etc)\n* Added settings that allows exceptions to be raised on view errors\n* Bug fixes\n\n1.4.0\n-----\n\n* Updated and reworked documentation\n* FileAdmin went through minor refactoring and now supports remote file systems.
