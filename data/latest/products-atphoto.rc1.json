    "description": "Eggification\n\n    Products.ATPhoto has been eggified on 2009/16/03\n\nAbout\n\n    ATPhoto is a product to manage photos in your Plone site. It provides two\n    new content types: Photo, Photo Album. A photo album is a container for\n    photos. The \"ATPhoto product page\":http://plone.org/products/atphoto/\n    contains the latest information about the product.\n\nBackground\n\n    This product was conceived during the \"Plone multimedia sprint\":http://plone.org/events/sprints/multimedia\n    and was developed primarily by Russ Ferriday (topia.com) and Jean-Francois Roche (jfroche.be).\n\n    Development work on ATPhoto continued on \"IRC\":irc://irc.freenode.net/plone4artists,\n    and there was another burst of activity during the \"Snow Sprint 2006\":http://plone.org/events/sprints/snow-sprint3 in Egg, Austria.\n\n    You are welcome to join in the development and report bugs as you find them.\n    See the mailing list and bug reporting section below.\n\n    ATPhoto is bundled with the \"PloneMultimedia\":http://plone.org/products/plonemultimedia/\n    package along with ATAudio and ATVideo, and some other programs which\n    improve Plone's handling of multimedia files.\n\n\nMailing List\n\n    Just send a mail to atphoto@plone4artists.org with \"subscribe\" as the subject.\n    You can read/search the \"archives\":http://lists.plone4artists.org/atphoto\n\nIssue tracker\n\n    Submit any bug you find or any feature you would like to see in this product:\n    \"Issue tracker\":http://plone.org/products/atphoto/issues\n\nDocumentation\n\n    Please see the \"documentation area\":http://plone.org/products/atphoto/documentation/\n    on the ATPhoto products page which also includes some screencasts.\n\nRoadmap\n\n    New features are considered by posting a message to the mailing list. If\n    your new feature is deemed feasible, you will be asked to write an\n    improvement proposal which will then be reviewed by the authors and others\n    in the development community, and if approved, added to the \"roadmap\":http://plone.org/products/atphoto/roadmap\n\nImportant INFO:\n\n    Since we don't want to see two different content type for images and photo, features in ATPhoto are for the moment\n    migrated to ATContentTypes (in the photoimage merge branch of ATContentTypes -\n    see http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ATContentTypes/branches/photoimagemerge-branch/ )\n    so all the feature you see here should be included in Plone Image content type. We are using a lot of Zope 3 stuffs\n    and don't know exactly when our branch will be merged with ATContentTypes. But anyway we will provide migration script\n    the day we switch to ATContentTypes.\n\nInstall\n\n    Simply place the ATPhoto folder in your Zope's Products dir, restart and\n    install in your Plone site using the 'portal_quickinstaller' tool in the\n    ZMI, or go to 'Site Setup' -> 'Add/Remove Products'.\n\nRequirements\n\n    ATPhoto is dependent on:\n\n  - Zope 2.8.x\n\n      - Five (included with Zope 2.8/2.9)\n\n  - Plone 2.1.2\n\n    - ATContentTypes (ATCT) product 1.0.3 (packaged in Plone 2.1.2)\n\n  - Python Imaging Library (PIL): http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\n    (incl. with OSX and Windows installers. On Linux you must install manually)\n\n  - FileSystemStorage (if you want your photos to be stored on the file system\n    instead of in the ZODB)\n    http://plone.org/products/filesystemstorage\n\nMaintainer(s)\n\n    Russ Ferriday (russ AT topia DOT com) russf on #plone or #plone4artists\n    Jean-Francois Roche (jfroche AT jfroche DOT be) jfroche on #plone or #plone4artists\n    IRC channels on Freenode (irc.freenode.net)\n\n    See 'AUTHORS.txt' for a list of other contributors\n\nRuss Ferriday <russ@topia.com>\nJean-Francois Roche <jfroche@jfroche.be>",
