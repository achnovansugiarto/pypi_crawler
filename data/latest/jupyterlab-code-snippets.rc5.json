You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\n# Move to jupyter-lab-code-snippets directory\n\n# Install dependencies\njlpm\n# Build Typescript source\njlpm build\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension install .\n# Rebuild Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes\njupyter lab build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab\njlpm watch\n# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab\njupyter lab --watch\n```\n\nNow every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).\n\n### Uninstall\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab-code-snippets\n```\n\nOR\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyterlab-code-snippets\n```\n",
