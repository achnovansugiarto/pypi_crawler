In the other direction you can also use this library to access sensor data from your phone to use in your ESP32 project with [Micropython](https://micropython.org/).\n\n## Supported boards\n- ESP 32\n\n## Concept of phyphox\n\nPhyphox is an open source app that has been developed at the RWTH Aachen University. It is available on Android and iOS and primarily aims at making the phone's sensors available for physics experiments. However, the app is based on a very flexible file format that defines data sources, visualizations (i.e. values and graphs) and data analysis (from simple formulas to Fourier transforms). This file format also allows to define Bluetooth Low Energy devices to exchange data from and to.\n\nThis library generates an experiment configuration in this file format and allows phyphox to conenct to your microcontroller. It directly transfers the configuration (including graph configurations, axis labels, etc.) to phyphox and provides function to submit data to be plotted in phyphox or receive sensor data.\n\n## Installation\n\n[TBD]\n\n## Usage\n\nThe easiest way to learn how to use this library is by looking at the examples in the `examples` folder. In most cases, you can simply connect to your Microcontroller running this library by scanning for Bluetooth devices via the \"+\"-button on the main screen of phyphox.\n\n### randomNumbers.ino\n\nThis is our minimal example. It submits random numbers to phyphox. All you need to do to submit a value to phyphox is including this library, starting the server (i.e. in `setup()`) and writing your data to the server.\n\n```python\nimport phyphoxBLE\nimport time\nimport random\n\ndef main():\n    p = phyphoxBLE.PhyphoxBLE()\n    p.start()                                #Start the BLE server\n        \n    while True:\n        randomNumber = random.randint(0,100) #Generate random number in the range 0 to 100\n        \n        p.write(randomNumber)                #Send value to phyphox\n        time.sleep_ms(500)                   #Shortly pause before repeating\n            \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### CreateExperiment.ino\n\nThis example shows how you can set a title, category and description as well as how to define graphs and setting axis labels and units. You can define one or multiple views (shown as tabs in phyphox), each of which can hold one or more graphs.\n\nFor each graph you need to call `setChannel(x, y)` with x and y being an index of your data set. This index corresponds to the order of the values that you transfer in a call to `server.write` while the index `0` is special and corresponds to the timestamp at which phyphox receives the value. At the moment `server.write` supports up to five values.\n\nFor example, let's assume you have the float values `foo` and `bar`. You can then call server.write(foo, bar) to send a set with both values. If you call `setChannel(0,1)`, your graph would plot `foo` on the y axis over time on the x axis. If you call `setChannel(2,1)`, your graph would plot `foo` on the y axis and `bar` on the x axis.\n\nHere are some useful methods to create your own experiment:\n\n| Target     | Method                   | Explanation                                                       |\n| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Experiment | setTitle(String)         | Sets a title for the experiment                                   |\n| Experiment | setCategory(String)      | Sets a category for the experiment                                |\n| Experiment | setDescription(String)   | Sets a description for the experiment                             |\n| Experiment | addView(View)            | Adds a view to the corresponding experiment                       |\n| Experiment | addExportSet(ExportSet)  | Adds an exportSet to the corresponding experiment                 |\n| View       | addElement(Element)      | Adds an element to the corresponding view                         |\n| View       | setLabel(String)         | Sets a label for the view                                         |\n| Graph      | setLabel(String)         | Sets a label for the graph                                        |\n| Graph      | setUnitX(String)         | Sets the unit for x (similar with y)                              |\n| Graph      | setLabelX(String)        | Sets a label for x (similar with y)                               |\n| Graph      | setXPrecision(int)       | Sets the amount of digits after the decimal point (similar with y)|\n| Graph      | setChannel(int, int)     | As explained above (1-5)                                          |\n| Graph      | setStyle(String)         | Sets the style.

In the example `getDataFromSmartphone.ino` you can see how a phyphox-file can be used to set up a sensor on the phone and retrieve its data on the microcontroller.\n\nAs the phyphox file format is extremely complex and powerful, please refer to the [phyphox wiki](https://phyphox.org/wiki/index.php/Phyphox_file_format) to learn about it and feel free to contact us if you are stuck or think that a specific aspect of the file format should be easily accessible through our Micropython library.\n\n### Further documentation\n\nFor now, this library is rather lightweight. Feel free to browse the files to learn about the functions that are already available.\n\n## Missing features\n\nIn the future we would like to see...\n- Some memory optimization\n- Compression for the transfer of the phyphox experiment generated on the microcontroller\n- Option to request a larger mtu size\n- Addition graph settings\n- Proper documentation\n\nIf you can help with this, we are happy to receive a pull request. You can contact us via contact@phyphox.org if you plan on a large addition to this library and want to make sure that it does not collide with anything we are already working on.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis library has been developed by the phyphox team at the RWTH Aachen University. In particular, the foundations and basic concept was created by Alexander Krampe as part of his Master thesis. The library has been further improved and is now maintained by Dominik Dorsel, our PhD student who also supervised Alexander's thesis.\n\n## Licence\n\nThis library is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence v3.0 (or newer).\n\n## Contact\n\nContact us any time at contact@phyphox.org and learn more about phyphox on https://phyphox.org.\n\n\n",
