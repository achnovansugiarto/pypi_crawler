Copyright (C) 2022 Fortra. All rights reserved.\n\nImpacket was originally created by [SecureAuth](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket), and now maintained by Fortra's Core Security.\n\nImpacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network\nprotocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level\nprogrammatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.\nSMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.\nPackets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from \nraw data, and the object-oriented API makes it simple to work with \ndeep hierarchies of protocols.\nThe library in this fork does not provide examples,\nwhich may result in detection by different anti-virus systems.\n\nWhat protocols are featured?\n----------------------------\n\n * Ethernet, Linux \"Cooked\" capture.\n * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP.\n * IPv4 and IPv6 Support.\n * NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 (high-level implementations).\n * MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP.\n * Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password/hashes/tickets/keys.\n * Portions/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, BKRP, DHCPM, EVEN6, MGMT, SASEC, TSCH, DCOM, WMI, OXABREF, NSPI, OXNSPI.\n * Portions of TDS (MSSQL) and LDAP protocol implementations.\n \nMaintainer\n==========\n\n[Core Security](https://www.coresecurity.com/)\n\n\nTable of Contents\n=================\n\n* [Getting Impacket](#getting-impacket)\n* [Setup](#setup)\n* [Testing](#testing)\n* [Licensing](#licensing)\n* [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n* [Contact Us](#contact-us)\n\nGetting Impacket\n================\n\n### Latest version\n\n* Impacket no examples v0.10.1 [Forked from Impacket v0.10.0]\n\n  [![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/impacket-no-examples.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/impacket-no-examples/)\n\n[Current and past releases](https://github.com/dar-suridata/impacket-no-examples/releases)\n\n### Development version\n\n* Impacket v0.10.1-dev (**[master branch](https://github.com/dar-suridata/impacket-no-examples/tree/master)**)\n\n  [![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%20|%203.7%20|%203.8%20|%203.9-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dar-suridata/impacket-no-examples/tree/master)\n\n\nSetup\n=====\n\n### Quick start\n\nIn order to grab the latest stable release with `pip` run:\n\n    python3 -m pip install impacket-no-examples\n\n\n### Installing the library\n\nIn order to install the library, download and\nextract the package, and execute the following command from the\ndirectory where the Impacket's release has been unpacked:\n\n    python3 -m pip install .\n\n> :information_source: This will install the library into the default Python\nmodules path.\n\n> We recommend using [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to\nmake sure system-wide installations doesn't interfere with it.\n\n\n### Docker Support\n\nBuild Impacket's image:\n\n      $ docker build -t \"impacket:latest\" .\n\nUsing Impacket's image:\n\n      $ docker run -it --rm \"impacket:latest\"\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThe library leverages the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) framework for organizing\nand marking test cases, [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) to automate the process of\nrunning them across supported Python versions, and [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)\nto obtain coverage statistics.\n\nA [comprehensive testing guide](TESTING.md) is available.\n\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nThis software is provided under a slightly modified version of\nthe Apache Software License.
