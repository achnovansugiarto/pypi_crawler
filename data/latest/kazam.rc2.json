Optionally you can record sound from any sound input device that is supported and visible by PulseAudio.\n\nInstallation\n============================\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install kazam==1.5.6 distutils-extra-python\n\nScreenshot\n============================\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/henrywoo/kazam-screen-recorder/blob/tmp/img/Kazam_001.png?raw=true\n   :alt: Kazam GUI Screenshot\n\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/henrywoo/kazam-screen-recorder/blob/tmp/img/Kazam_002.png?raw=true\n   :alt: Kazam Preferences Screenshot\n\n\n\nRunning Kazam\n============================\n\nFrom Source Code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to run Kazam from the source tree, there are a few limitations that you have to take into account. Every icon has to be taken from currently installed icon theme. Toolbars will not show any icons and you will not see Unity AppIndicator.\n\nTo run Kazam simply execute te following commands in the source tree:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  $ cd bin\n  $ ./kazam\n\n\nFrom Command Line\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMake sure **~/.local/bin** into you PATH, and run `kazam` in your terminal should work.\n\n\nFrom GUI\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you already have Kazam installed then Kazam icons will be displayed properly.\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n============================\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  SUPER-CTRL-Q - Quit\n  SUPER-CTRL-W - Show/Hide main window\n  SUPER-CTRL-R - Start Recording\n  SUPER-CTRL-F - Finish Recording\n\nIn a normal logitech keyboard, SUPER-CTRL is Ctrl+CMD.\n\n\n\nRecording Tips\n============================\n\nChoose small numerb of framerate. My personal setup is framerate equal to 3. Framerates above 20fps are unlikely to work well because of software and hardware limitations. If you increase framerate and framerate in resulting video drops, that is because encoder can't keep up.\n\nAlways do a sound check. Especially if you are recording a live commentary with background sound. I got the best results when I used earphones to listen to the audio while recording. This way your mic will not pick up any audio coming from speakers.\n\nIf you _really_ want loss-less quality, then you will have to record in RAW format. This is possible, but without an SSD with a lot of free space your results will be terrible. 1920x1080 at 15 frames per second will need around 45 MB of disk space per second. Most people will want to record at 20 or 25 frames per second. Most disk will not handle that and your\nsystem will start to crawl.\n\nYour next best bet is HUFFYUV format, which is a little bit friendlier on disk bandwidth with 28 MB per second at 15 frames per second. The problem? Not many video editors and players can handle HUFFYUV, let alone video sharing services.\n\n\n\nDebugging & reporting problems\n========================================================\n\nIf you encounter a bug or any kind of unexpected behavior please try to reproduce it while you run Kazam from standard terminal with --debug option. Use Launchpad to report bugs (https://github.com/henrywoo/kazam-screen-recorder/issues) and include generated output.\n\n----\n\n.. |image0| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrywoo/kazam-screen-recorder/master/kazam.png\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/hiq/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://hiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n.. |CodeCov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/uber/athenadriver/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n   :target: https://hiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n.. |Github release| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.5.6-red\n   :target: https://github.com/uber/athenadriver/releases\n.. |lic| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-red\n   :target: https://github.com/uber/athenadriver/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n\n\n",
