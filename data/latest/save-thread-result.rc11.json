    "description": "# Python API\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstalling the `save_thread_result` module:\n```\npip3 install -U save-thread-result     # MacOS/Linux\npip  install -U save-thread-result     # Windows\n\n# if that doesn't work:\npython3 -m pip install -U save-thread-result     # MacOS/Linux\npython  -m pip install -U save-thread-result     # Windows\n```\n\nUsing the `ThreadWithResult` class from the `save_thread_result` module:\n```\nfrom save_thread_result import ThreadWithResult\n\n\n# As of Release 0.0.3, you can also specify values for\n# `group`, `name`, and `daemon` if you want to set those\n# values manually.\n\nthread = ThreadWithResult(\n    target = my_function,\n    args   = (my_function_arg1, my_function_arg2, ...)\n    kwargs = {my_function_kwarg1: kwarg1_value, my_function_kwarg2: kwarg2_value, ...}\n)\n\nthread.start()\nthread.join()\nif getattr(thread, 'result', None):\n    print(thread.result)\nelse:\n    # thread.result attribute not set - something caused\n    # the thread to terminate BEFORE the thread finished\n    # executing the function passed in through the\n    # `target` argument\n    print('ERROR! Something went wrong while executing this thread, and the function you passed in did NOT complete!!')\n```\n\nReading the documentation for more information:\n```\nfrom save_thread_result import ThreadWithResult\nhelp(ThreadWithResult)\n```\n\n## Short explanation\n\nThis module uses a [`threading.Thread`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread) subclass `ThreadWithResult` that saves the result of a thread (from [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) built-in module in the [Python Standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)) as its `result` attribute - i.e. after the thread finishes running, call `thread.result` to get the return value from the function that ran on that thread.\n\n## Examples\n\nDummy example:\n```\nfrom save_thread_result import ThreadWithResult\n\nimport time, random\n\n\ndef function_to_thread(n):\n    count = 0\n    while count < 3:\n            print(f'Still running thread {n}...')\n            count +=1\n            time.sleep(3)\n    result = random.random()\n    print(f'Return value of thread {n} should be: {result}')\n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    thread1 = ThreadWithResult(target=function_to_thread, args=(1,))\n    thread2 = ThreadWithResult(target=function_to_thread, args=(2,))\n    thread1.start()\n    thread2.start()\n    thread1.join()\n    thread2.join()\n    print(thread1.result)\n    print(thread2.result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>More information</b></summary>\n\n  <details>\n    <summary><b>Sources I looked at before creating the custom class</b></summary>\n\n  - [Return value from thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1886090/return-value-from-thread)\n  - [Threading in python: retrieve return value when using target= [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2577233/threading-in-python-retrieve-return-value-when-using-target)\n  - [How to get the return value from a thread in python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6893968/how-to-get-the-return-value-from-a-thread-in-python)\n  - [Using Python Threading and Returning Multiple Results (Tutorial)](https://www.shanelynn.ie/using-python-threading-for-multiple-results-queue/)\n  - [How to get the return value from a thread using python](https://www.edureka.co/community/31966/how-to-get-the-return-value-from-a-thread-using-python)\n  - [How to manage python threads results?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3239617/how-to-manage-python-threads-results#3239815)\n  - [How to obtain the results from a pool of threads in python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26104512/how-to-obtain-the-results-from-a-pool-of-threads-in-python)\n  - [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=python%20save%20thread%20result)\n  </details>\n</details>\n\n\n",
