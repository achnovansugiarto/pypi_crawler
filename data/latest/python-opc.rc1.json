    "description": "##########\npython-opc\n##########\n\nVERSION: 0.0.1d (first development release)\n\n\nSTATUS (as of July 4 2013)\n==========================\n\nFirst development release. Under active development.\n\n\nVision\n======\n\nA robust, general-purpose library for manipulating Open Packaging Convention\n(OPC) packages, suitable as a foundation for a family of Open XML document\nlibraries. Also to be suitable for general purpose manipulation of OPC\npackages, for example to access the XML and binary contents for indexing\npurposes and perhaps for manipulating package parts, for example to remove\nslide notes pages or to assemble presentations from individual slides in a\nlibrary.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation is hosted on Read The Docs (readthedocs.org) at\nhttps://python-opc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.\n\n\nReaching out\n============\n\nWe'd love to hear from you if you like |po|, want a new feature, find a bug,\nneed help using it, or just have a word of encouragement.\n\nThe **mailing list** for |po| is python-opc@googlegroups.com\n\nThe **issue tracker** is on github at `python-openxml/python-opc`_.\n\nFeature requests are best broached initially on the mailing list, they can be\nadded to the issue tracker once we've clarified the best approach,\nparticularly the appropriate API signature.\n\n.. _`python-openxml/python-opc`:\n   https://github.com/python-openxml/python-opc\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n|po| may be installed with ``pip`` if you have it available::\n\n    pip install python-opc\n\nIt can also be installed using ``easy_install``::\n\n    easy_install python-opc\n\nIf neither ``pip`` nor ``easy_install`` is available, it can be installed\nmanually by downloading the distribution from PyPI, unpacking the tarball,\nand running ``setup.py``::\n\n    tar xvzf python-opc-0.0.1d1.tar.gz\n    cd python-opc-0.0.1d1\n    python setup.py install\n\n|po| depends on the ``lxml`` package. Both ``pip`` and ``easy_install`` will\ntake care of satisfying that dependency for you, but if you use this last\nmethod you will need to install ``lxml`` yourself.\n\n\nRelease History\n===============\n\nJuly 4, 2013 - v0.0.1d1\n   * Establish initial enviornment and development branches\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLicensed under the `MIT license`_.
