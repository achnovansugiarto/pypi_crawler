    "description": "# BIFS\n**Bayesian Image Analysis in Fourier Space**\n\nBIFS is a framework and set of computational tools for implementation of Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space. The BIFS approach enables enhanced feature contrast and noise reduction, analogous to, but much more efficiently than Bayesian methods applied directly in image space, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This efficiency is provided by the fact that for a large class of images the Fourier modes can reasonably be approximated as being independent, thus reducing the optimization problem from one involving a large number of coupled variables to one involving a product of independent one dimensional optimizations. BIFS is useful for a large class of images and in particular for medical imaging problems, including clinical imaging studies, screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\nPrerequisites: \n   - Python3 installed on your computer.\n\nFor the impatient, here are steps which should install the package and\nlaunch the GUI:\n\n```shell\n#python may work instead of python3, depending on your environment\n#py -3 should work on MS-Windows\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\npython3 -m pip install bifs\nbifs_gui\n```\nbifs requires a number of other substantial software packages, including SciPy and PyQt5,\nwhich the installation should take care of if they are not already present.\n\nVirtual Environments\n--------------------\n\nSee [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages) for much more\ninformation about how to install python packages.  In particular, we endorse their\nstrong recommendation to *use virtual environments*, which are omitted from the steps above.\n\nOn Windows inside a virtual environment we have found `python` rather than `python3` is necessary.\n\nWe recommend against using the Windows-specific `py` command since it only respects the venv [sometimes, for example `py -3` will ignore it,](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#virtual-environments) under Python 3.9, and may have been even less reliable with earlier versions.\n\nQt Compatibility Problems\n-------------------------\n\nThe graphical program `bifs_gui` depends on the `Qt` graphic framework.  This will be installed automatically if it is not present, \nbut if it is already present the packages that `pip` installs may not be compatible with it.  We found this to be the case on Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster).  If you get such a problem, you can fix it by specifying an explicit version for PyQt5 with `==`:\n\n```bash\n(testEnv) ross@barley:~/UCSF/Kornak$ python -m pip install PyQt5==5.11.2\nCollecting PyQt5==5.11.2\n  Downloading PyQt5-5.11.2-5.11.1-cp35.cp36.cp37.cp38-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (117.9 MB)\n     |â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 117.9 MB 84 kB/s \nCollecting PyQt5_sip<4.20,>=4.19.11\n  Downloading PyQt5_sip-4.19.19-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (67 kB)\n     |â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 67 kB 997 kB/s \nInstalling collected packages: PyQt5-sip, PyQt5\n  Attempting uninstall: PyQt5-sip\n    Found existing installation: PyQt5-sip 12.9.0\n    Uninstalling PyQt5-sip-12.9.0:\n      Successfully uninstalled PyQt5-sip-12.9.0\n  Attempting uninstall: PyQt5\n    Found existing installation: PyQt5 5.15.4\n    Uninstalling PyQt5-5.15.4:\n      Successfully uninstalled PyQt5-5.15.4\nSuccessfully installed PyQt5-5.11.2 PyQt5-sip-4.19.19\n```\n\n5.11.2 is the version of `Qt` that was already on the system, while 5.15.4 is the version that `pip` installed.\n\nThe current stable release of Debian is 11 (bullseye) and uses `Qt` 5.15.2, probably close enough to work with the default installation of `PyQt5`.\n\nSee https://github.com/ucsf-deb/bifs/issues/25 for more.\n\nAn alternative would be to manually install the required packages (see the `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` files) using your OS's package manager instead of `pip`, and then install `bifs` *without* using a  virtual environment.\n\n\nFallback Installation of Dependencies\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe are still working on the packaging, as well as the instructions, and it is possible \nyou will encounter difficulties.  If the necessary dependencies are not installed automatically,\ntry changing to the top level of the repository and executing\n```shell\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nIf even that doesn't work, you can manually tell it to install the packages listed in the \n[requirements file](requirements.txt), e.g.,\n```shell\npython3 -m pip install numpy\n```\n\nFallback Package Setup\n----------------------\nIf the regular setup fails it means that `import bifs` will not be able to find the package.\nSince the bifs code itself does such imports, it won't run without it.\n\nA workaround is to manually add an entry to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable for the \nroot directory of the repository you cloned from GitHub.\n\nIf you clone the project following the instructions above and you are in `/tmp`, it will create a directory `/tmp/bifs`.  It is this\ndirectory, not `/tmp/bifs/bifs` that you will find under it, that should go in `PYTHONPATH`.\nSee how to do it graphically or from the command line on [MS-Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-so-it-finds-my-modules-packages)\nor for [Mac or Linux](https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/using_pythonpath.html).  One can also manipulate `sys.path` inside a Python\nprogram.\n\nKnown Compatible Software Versions\n----------------------------------\nBIFS is known to work with the following versions but will typically work with many earlier\nversions as well:\n * Python 3\n * numpy 1.17 (no earlier)\n * scipy 1.2.1-1\n * matplotlib 2.2.4-2\n * imageio 2.4.1\n * jsonpickle 1.2\n * pyqt5 5.7.1-1 (note: some version of PyQT 5 is required, i.e.\n   the package will not work with PyQT 4)\n * nibabel is listed in the requirements file, but the software will\n   run without it.  It is only needed if you load an image type for which\n   it is required, e.g., a .nii file.\n\nUsing BIFS\n==========\nSee the more [detailed guide](https://github.com/ucsf-deb/bifs/blob/master/README.rst) and the extensive comments in the code for how to use the package.\n\nExploring the code\n==================\nhttps://github.com/ucsf-deb/bifs\n\n\n",
