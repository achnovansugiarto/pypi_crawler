    "description": "\n# VICI valve\n\nThis repo contains a driver class for the VICI Valco Universal Electric Actuator (aka VICI valve). The code should work\nfor both the USB and the RS232/485 variety.\n\nThis is an unofficial package; we are not affiliated with VICI (Valco Instruments Company Inc.).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall `vicivalve` from PyPI by running `pip install vicivalve` or add `vicivalve` to your `requirements.txt` file.\n\nAlternately, run `pip install git+https://gitlab.com/heingroup/vicivalve` or add `git+https://gitlab.com/heingroup/vicivalve` to your\n`requirements.txt` file.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThis package is intended for use with the [VICI Universal Electric Actuator](https://www.vici.com/act/ua.php).\nThis actuator works for two position and multiposition valves, and comes in two varieties: one with a USB B receptacle\nat the back, and one with three pins that can be used with either RS232 or RS485. A third variety uses BCD (binary coded\ndecimal) but this version is not compatible with this library. Note also that the RS232/485 versions have two different\norder codes, but according to the [manual](https://www.vici.com/support/manuals/universal-actuator.pdf) they can be\nconverted by setting a switch on the PCB.\n\nThe USB variety uses an FTDI chip and shows up as virtual COM port or VCP on your PC. The USB version works with this\npackage directly, just plug it into your PC and crack on. The RS232/485 version uses two\ninternally connected 3 pin TE Connectivity AMP connector headers. The valve comes with a mating cable assembly, the user\ncan also make their own connector (Housing: [102241-1](https://www.digikey.ca/products/en?keywords=%20A26982-ND), contacts:\n[87756-4](https://www.digikey.ca/products/en?keywords=A25969CT-ND)). Either way, in order to work with this package, an\n[FTDI USB to serial converter cable](https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBRS232.htm) is required (I personally\nrecommend buying the wire ended FTDI cable and crimping on a connector). The `ftdi_serial` library currently does not\nwork properly with non-FTDI converter cables!\n\n## Usage\n\nThe package is meant to be as simple and user friendly as possible. The VICI class takes a Serial object as argument:\n\n```python\nfrom ftdi_serial import Serial\nfrom vicivalve import VICI\n\nserial = Serial(device_serial='FOO', baudrate=9600)\nvalve = VICI(serial=serial)\n```\n\nThe `device_serial` is the unique serial number of your valve (if it's USB) or your converter cable. In order to find\nthat ID, plug in your valve/cable and run `Serial.list_device_serials()` from a Python console.\n\nThe Baud rate is a property of the controller and needs to be set explicitly. 9600 is the default baud rate. If you can't\nestablish communication, a wrong baud rate is the most likely cause. Refer to the [manual](https://www.vici.com/support/manuals/universal-actuator.pdf)\nfor viewing and changing the baud rate of a controller.\n\nWith RS485, multiple actuators can be daisy-chained and used with one USB converter. In that case, the same `Serial`\nobject is passed to both valve instances:\n\n```python\nvalve1 = VICI(serial=serial, address=1)\nvalve2 = VICI(serial=serial, address=2)\n```\n\nHowever, in that case, every valve has to have its own address. Refer to the manual for details on multidrop communication\nand how to set the device address.\n\nOnce instantiated, the valve can be switched like so:\n\n```python\nvalve.home()  # sends the valve to position A or 1\nvalve.switch_valve(\"B\")  # sends the valve to position B\nvalve.switch_valve(1)  # sends the valve back to position A, using an integer as argument\nvalve.toggle()  # sends the valve to position B, since it was in A before\nvalve.toggle()  # sends the valve back to position A\n```\n\nLastly, if a new valve head is installed, the actuator needs to \"learn\" the new end stop positions:\n\n```python\nvalve.learn()\n```\n\nThis will stall the actuator against both end stops and record those positions. This takes a few seconds and sounds pretty\nawful, but don't worry, it's supposed to work that way.\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Sebastian Steiner** - *Initial work, current maintainer*\n* **Sean Clark** - *Tech support*\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* VICI Valco\n* Stack Overflow\n\n\n",
