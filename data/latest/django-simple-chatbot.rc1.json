    "description": "# Django Simple Chatbot\n\nIt's a very basic Chatbot for Python Django including NLTK and \nDjango-REST-framework. This Chatbot is currently working without\nMachine learning algorithms. Decisions are made by simple statistic evaluation.\n\nThe Algorithm is based on labeled data on your Django Database and the tool\nis supporting continuous labeling.\n\n## Requirements\n- Python (3.7, 3.8, 3.9)\n- Django (2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2)\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Django REST-Framework - Awesome web-browsable Web APIs.](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)\n- [NLTK - the Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using `pip` ...\n\n```\npip install django-simple-chatbot\n```\n\nadd `simple_chatbot` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.\n\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...,\n    'simple_chatbot'\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** Make sure to run `manage.py migrate` after changing your settings.\nThe simple_chatbot app provides Django database migrations.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nCreate a `response.py` file inside of an already installed app.\n```\nfrom simple_chatbot.responses import GenericRandomResponse\n\n\nclass GreetingResponse(GenericRandomResponse):\n    choices = (\"Hey, how can I help you?\",\n               \"Hey friend. How are you? How can I help you?\")\n\n\nclass GoodbyeResponse(GenericRandomResponse):\n    choices = (\"See you later.\",\n               \"Thanks for visiting.\",\n               \"See ya! Have a nice day.\")\n```\n\nAdd this Response to your `SIMPLE_CHATBOT` setting\n```\nSIMPLE_CHATBOT = {\n    ...\n    'responses': (\n        (\"YOUR_APP.responses.GreetingResponse\", \"Greeting\"),\n        (\"YOUR_APP.responses.GoodbyeResponse\", \"Goodbye\"),\n    ),\n}\n```\n\nGo to your Django admin and create `greeting` and `goodbye` tags.\nYour response options will be selectable via choices.\n\nGo to your Django admin, write some patterns and label them. You can just use\nthe following labels:\n```\n[Greeting]\n\"Hi, how are you?\", \"Is anyone there?\", \"Hello\", \"What's up?!\", \"hey there!\"\n\n[\"Goodbye\"]\n\"Bye\", \"See you later\", \"Goodbye\", \"I need to go now.\"\n```\n**Note** If you do not want to write that patterns by yourself, use a command\n`manage.py simple_chatbot_initial`. You need to label them after initializing.\n\nThe package will automatically tokenize the input and map tokens to labels.\n\nAdd simple_chatbot url to your routings:\n```\nfrom simple_chatbot.views import SimpleChatbot\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    ...\n    path(\"simple_chatbot/\", SimpleChatbot.as_view())\n]\n```\n\nMake a Post request to your new endpoint:\n```\ncurl \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    --data '{\"message\":\"how r u?\"}' \\\n    http://localhost:8000/simple_chatbot/\n```\n\nThe response should look like\n```\n{\n    \"tag\": \"Greeting\",\n    \"message\": \"Hey, how can I help you?\"\n}\n```\n\n## Raw Documentation\n\n### Database Models\n- `Pattern` - message which might be send by a user. Add a tag to the pattern\n    for being able to identify and response to that message\n- `Tag` - includes information about Response class for a specific method\n- `Token` - tokenized words which are referencing to different patterns. The\n    user-input will be identified by different tokens.\n- `UserMessageInput` - new inputs from production. It contains information\n    about chosen pattern. You can label that messages later and include them\n    into the system.\n\n### settings options\nYou can add following options to your `SIMPLE_CHATBOT` setting:\n- STEMMER_MODULE: nltk package for stumming your strings - \n    default: `nltk.stem.lancaster.LancasterStemmer`.\n- responses: choices for your tags. It should reference to a response class.\n    **Warning** You won't be able to create tags without response classes.\n\n### Response Classes\nThe `simple_chatbot.responses` package provides currently following response classes:\n- BaseResponse\n- GenericRandomResponse\n\n#### BaseResponse\nIt's just an abstract class for require a specific shape of your response\nclasses. If you are creating a new response, you should inheritance from that\nclass.\n\n#### GenericRandomResponse\nIt will choose a generic answer from class property `choices`.\n\n### Views\nThis `simple_chatbot.responses` includes a single view `SimpleChatbot`.\nThis view is reusable. The most important changeble option:\n- `save_pattern`: if True each message will be saved and you can post label\n    the incoming messages. default `True`.\n\n#### SimpleChatbot API Documentation\n- Required Request type: `POST`\n- payload: `{message: \"YOUR MESSAGE\"}`\n- response: `{tag: 'TAG', message: 'RESPONSE'}`\n\n## About\nIt's a very basic Chatbot decisions are made with tools by NLTK which follows\nbasic preprocessing for NLP of tokenization and stumming.\n\nThis package is inspired by the Chatbot Tutorial of Tech witch Tim.\nCheckout his blog: https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/ai-chatbot/\n\nIn my opinion the used script is teaching important concepts but it's \novertooled by using Deep-Learning algorithm on that small amount of data.\n\nReal NLP's and Deep Learning algorithms needs a large amount of data. One\nproblem in smaller and beginning projects: You won't have that amount of data\nby starting your projects. \n\n**This package gives you possibilities to work with a small amount of data and\nit helps you to collect new data for being able to use deep learning\nalgorithms one day.**\n\n### Contributing\nFork the repo and get stuck in!\n\n\n",
