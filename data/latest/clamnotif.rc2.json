    "description": "# ClamNotif: Monitor ClamAV Health Reports Automatically\n\n*ClamNotif*, a.k.a *ClamAV Notification*, is a handy and simple tool written in Python, which is able to forward notifications to different recipients categorised by two severity levels of the regular health reports produced by `clamscan` bundled with the [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) antivirus engine.\n\n## What challenge we had faced\n\nWe, [PiSoft Company Ltd.](http://www.pisoft.com.mo/), is a software company based in [Macao S.A.R](https://www.gov.mo/en/). For more than a decade, we have been developing , operating and maintaining software systems for many clients. For system security, we use ClamAV to scan the server regularly.\n\nUsually, that is done in the form of a daily heath check on the server. Because ClamAV is an antivirus engine __only__, in order to make our operation as automatic as possible, we have to find a solution to forward those health reports automatically.\n\nAs part of our daily operations, if ClamAV doesn't find any thing infected, a health report should be forwarded to our maintenance team as a __heart-beating__ signal. This is quite important, especially during the __pilot period__, which is the very beginning of a new system running in Production.\n\nOn the other hand, if ClamAV finds some files infected, the health report shall be forwarded to our maintenance team as well as the *representative* of our client as an __alert__.\n\nWe googled for a solution with no luck, only some pieces of bash scripts cooperating with `mailx` available. Perhaps, building a tool ourselves for our requirement seems *unavoidable*.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst of all, we can install ClamNotif by\n\n```console\n$ pip3 install clamnotif\n```\n\nlet's check if it works properly\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m clamnotif\n```\n\nWe should see\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m clamnotif\n  Welcome for using ClamNotif v0.0.5 from PiSoft Company Ltd.\n  Usage: python3 -m clamnotif [--test-smtp|--check-report]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Prepare Our Configurations\nThe configuration file of ClamNotif is an *ini* file designed with intuitive variable names. Please make sure to save the configuration file as `~/.clamnotif/clamnotif.cfg`.\n\nClamNotif *always* reads all configurations under the home folder of the current user. Thus the __read permission__ of the configuration file needs to be granted to ClamNotif, which should be the default in most cases.\n\nOnce our configuration completes, please make sure the *ClamAVReportFolder* as well as the files inside the folder can be read by the current user. In the following case, we have to check the directory `~/.ClamAV/daily/`.\n\nWhen the system is getting more and more stable, a daily notification would not be necessary. We can fine-tune how often a heart-beat is sent by setting *HeartbeatDayGap*. In the following example, suppose ClamNotif forwarded a heart-beat on 17/Apr, the next heart-beat would be sent on 19/Apr, i.e., __2 days__ later. This value has no impact on the sending of alerts. Once an alert is detected, it will be sent to the recipients immediately.\n\n```ini\n[SMTP]\nSMTPServerHost = smtp.gmail.com\nSMTPServerPort = 465\nSMTPTLSEnabled = false\n\n[Notification]\nSenderAddress = foo@gmail.com\nSenderPasswd = $@SendPwd\nAlertSubject = My System Antivirus Notification - Alert !!!\nAlertReceiverAddresses = alice@gmail.com,robert@gmail.com,sysadmin@gmail.com\nHeartbeatSubject = My System Antivirus Heartbeating Notification\nHeartbeatReceiverAddresses = sysadmin@gmail.com\nHeartbeatDayGap = 2\n\n[ClamAV]\nClamAVReportFolder = ~/.ClamAV/daily/\n```\n### Test Our Configurations\nLet's send a testing email to all recipients defined in the configuration file above by turning on the flag `--test-smtp`. Check our email box to see if we can receive the email for testing.\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m clamnotif --test-smtp\n  Successfully sent a testing email with title 'ClamNotif Testing' to foo@gmail.com and alice@gmail.com,robert@gmail.com,sysadmin@gmail.com.\n```\nIf it works, we can go further. The flag `--check-report` tells ClamNotif to check the *ClamAVReportFolder* and to send a notification to the appropriate recipients.\n```console\n$ python3 -m clamnotif --check-report\n  [Should add the command outputs later]\n```\n`python3 -m clamnotif --check-report` is the most common usage of ClamNotif.\n\n## Run ClamNotif Daily\nWe are able to run `clamnotif` regularly by registering it as a schedule job with `crontab`.\n\nHere is an article [Complete Beginners Tutorial](https://linuxhint.com/cron_jobs_complete_beginners_tutorial/) for your reference.\n\n## Bash Scripts\n\nThere are some handy *bash* scripts which we use to wrap `clamscan` and `clamnotif` under the `bash` folder. Just see if they are helpful.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nWe built this tool in memory of *Mr Brain Iu*, who was a visionary in the field of software development and had been promoting the Python Programming Language in Macao long before it became all the rage .\n\nHope you find it useful. Drop me a line if you like it!\n\n\n",
