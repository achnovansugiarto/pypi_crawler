    "description": "Nedry discord bot 2.4.1\n=======================\n\n(formerly \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\")\n\nNedry is a self-hosted discord bot with a modular plugin system. Lots of useful\nbehaviour is available out-of-the-box, but you can also install plugins to extend\nNedry's behaviour, or even write your own plugins.\n\nSome out-of-the-box features include:\n\n* Stream announcements for twitch, with highly configurable stream announcement messages\n  (write your own stream announcement messages with format tokens for variable data like\n  stream url, discord bot name, etc. and optionally disable stream announcements when\n  you yourself are streaming)\n* Scheduled discord messages as DMs or in public channels\n* Telling knock-knock jokes (and remembering jokes that are told by discord users)\n* Looking something up on wikipedia (or providing a summary of a random wikipedia article)\n* Interactive trivia questions (via opentdb.com)\n* Collaborative story writing; provide a randomly selected story prompt, and collect\n  everyone's contributions to build a story together\n\nAll of the features mentioned above are implemented as modular plugins in the ``nedry/builtin_plugins``\ndirectory, which serves as a helpful reference for plugin writers.\n\nTo get started right away, see the `Quick start`_ section.\n\n.. contents:: **Table of Contents**\n\nLimitations\n===========\n\n* Nedry currently does not support being invited to multiple discord servers at once--\n  you must run one instance per discord server.\n\n* Nedry is a self-hosted bot-- this means you have to run the python program\n  yourself on a machine that you control, and configure it to connect specifically\n  to your discord server.\n\nMigrating from \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\"\n===========================================\n\nThe project name changed, but all the features that were present in \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\"\nare still present in \"nedry\". The following steps will be necessary to switch to \"nedry\":\n\n* Un-install the \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\" package, and install the \"nedry\" package\n* Replace all \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\" references to \"nedry\" (e.g. if you have a\n  script or another program which runs the bot). Your existing bot configuration file for\n  \"twitch_monitor_discord_bot\" will still work with nedry.\n\nThat's it!\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nInstall for Python (only Python 3.9x or greater is supported) using ``pip``:\n\n::\n\n    python -m pip install nedry\n\nQuick start\n===========\n\nCreating the config file and starting the bot\n---------------------------------------------\n\n#. Run the package as a module with no arguments, which will create an empty configuration\n   file called ``default_bot_config.json`` in your current directory and exit immediately.\n\n   ::\n\n       $ python -m nedry\n\n       Created default config file 'default_bot_config.json', please add required parameters\n\n#. Most of the behaviours of this bot can be configured via discord messages while the\n   bot is up and running, but there are a few parameters that need to be set in the configuration\n   file first, to get the bot talking to your discord server. Populate these required\n   parameters in the .json file:\n\n   #. ``discord_bot_api_token``: Discord bot API token must be entered here as a string.\n      `Create a new bot application, and generate/copy token on the \"Bot\" page <https://discord.com/developers/applications>`_\n      (NOTE: make sure to enable all Privileged Gateway Intents for your bot application).\n\n   #. ``discord_server_id``: Discord server ID (the server that you want the bot to\n      connect to) must be entered here as an integer.\n      `How to find discord user/server/message IDs <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID->`_\n\n   #. ``discord_admin_users``: A list of discord user IDs as integers may be  entered here.\n      Admin users have access to the full set of discord commands that the bot can accept.\n      At the very least, you'll probably want to add your own discord user ID here so that\n      you have full control of the bot.\n      `How to find discord user/server/message IDs <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID->`_\n\n#. Once all required parameters have been set in the .json file, run the package as a module\n   again, but this time pass your configuration file as an argument:\n\n   ::\n\n       $ python -m nedry default_bot_config.json\n\n\n   If configured correctly, then the bot should now connect to your discord server. You're done editing the config file!\n\n\nFurther initial configuration: interacting with the bot on discord\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhenever your bot is online in the discord server, you can issue commands to the bot\nby putting a mention of the bot's discord name at the beginning of the message, either\nin a DM or in any channel the bot has access to, e.g. ``@BotName !command``. The only\ncommand you *really* need to know is the ``help`` command;\nif you say ``@BotName !help``, then the bot will show you what commands are available\nand show you how to get more specific help with individual commands.\n\nAside from the first 3 things you set in the bot's configuration file in the previous section,\neverything else about the bot's behaviour can be configured by sending messages/commands to\nthe bot on discord. One thing you might want configure in this way, is how twitch streamers\nare monitored for stream announcements.\n\nThe following steps are required to enable twitch stream announcements:\n\n#. **Setting which twitch streamers to monitor**\n\n   Send the \"addstreamers\" command, with one or more arguments, each of which must\n   be the name of an existing twitch channel. e.g. \"@BotName !addstreamers channel1 channel2\":\n\n   .. image:: images/addstreamers.png\n\n   Changes to the list of streamers are saved in the configuration file.\n\n   For information about how to view the list of streamers being monitored, and how to\n   remove a streamer from the list, use the \"@BotName !help streamers\" and \"@BotName !help removestreamers\"\n   commands.\n\n#. **Setting the discord channel for stream announcements**\n\n   Send the \"announcechannel\" command with one argument, which should be the name of the discord\n   channel you would like stream announcements to be sent to. e.g. \"@BotName !announcechannel channel-name\":\n\n   .. image:: images/set_channel.png\n\n   The stream announcement channel name is saved in the configuration file.\n\n#. **Setting custom phrases for stream announcements**\n\n   This is optional, but there is only 1 default stream announcement phrase, so\n   you might want to add some of your own. Each time a streamer goes live, one\n   of your stream announcement phrases is picked randomly for the announcement.\n   Phrases may contain format tokens (see the \"@BotName !help addphrase\" command\n   for more information about format tokens). e.g. \"@BotName !addphrase some custom phrase\":\n\n   .. image:: images/add_phrase.png\n\n   For reference, the phrase from the previous image produces the following stream announcement\n   when a streamer named \"OhmLab\" starts streaming on a Wednesday:\n\n   .. image:: images/stream_announcement.PNG\n\n   All stream announcement phrases are saved in the configuration file.\n\n#. **Setting twitch client ID and client secret**\n\n   in a DM with the bot in discord, or in any public channel, send the \"twitchclientid\"\n   command with two arguments, e.g. \"@BotName !twitchclientid xxxx yyyy\".\n\n   Replace \"xxxx\" with your twitch client ID, and replace \"yyyy\" with  your twitch client\n   secret. You must have a twitch account, and register an application, to obtain a\n   client ID and client secret for your application. `instructions here <https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app>`_.\n\n   .. image:: images/set_twitchclientid.png\n\n\n   You can change the client ID and client secret at any time, using the same command.\n   The client ID and client secret you provide with this command is saved in the config file,\n   so there is no need to re-send this every time you start the bot.\n\nRunning nedry as a systemctl service\n====================================\n\nUse the `nedry.service <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eriknyquist/nedry/master/scripts/nedry.service>`__\nfile available on github to quickly create a systemctl service for running nedry.\n\nNOTE: This service loads a config file at ``/home/ubuntu/nedry_config.json``, you may\nneed to edit the \"ExecStart\" line and change that path to your config file location.\n\nNOTE: This service loads the environment of a user named \"ubuntu\", you may need to\nedit the \"User\" line and change the username to your own username.\n\nWriting and using plugins\n=========================\n\n* In order to use plugins, you must add at least one directory path to the ``plugin_directories``\n  list in the configuration file. Plugins are installed by placing the python file(s) directly\n  in the top level of any directory listed in ``plugin_directories`` (not in a subdirectory!).\n  If any valid plugins exist in any the directories listed in ``plugin_directories`` when the\n  bot starts up, they will be loaded and available for use.\n\n* All loaded plugins are enabled by default. To see a list of all plugins, enabled and\n  disabled, use the ``!plugins`` command. To disable/enable a plugin, use the\n  ``!plugson`` and ``!plugsoff`` commands. For example, to disable the built-in\n  ``knock_knock_jokes`` plugin, use ``@BotName !plugsoff knock_knock_jokes``.\n\n* To get started with writing plugins, see `this sample plugin <https://github.com/eriknyquist/nedry/blob/master/example_plugins/echo_dm_example.py>`_.\n\n  Also, see `this more complex built-in plugin <https://github.com/eriknyquist/nedry/blob/master/nedry/builtin_plugins/stories.py>`_\n\n\nMisc. sample bot interactions\n=============================\n\nThe following are some screenshots of miscellaneous command / response interactions\nwith the bot in discord. This section is *not* intended as a comprehensive reference\nof all available commands (see the \"Bot command reference\" section at the end for that),\nbut rather a quick illustration of what it looks like to interact with the bot in discord.\n\nAnnouncements for when a twitch streamer goes live\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/stream_announcement.PNG\n\n\nScheduling a message in a public channel\n----------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/scheduled_message.PNG\n\nScheduling a DM reminder\n------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/reminder.PNG\n\nRequesting a knock-knock joke from the bot\n------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/tell_joke.PNG\n\nTelling a knock-knock joke for the bot to remember\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/remember_joke.PNG\n\nAsking the bot to do a wikipedia search\n---------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/wiki.png\n\nAsking the bot to make fun of the last thing someone said\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: images/mocking.PNG\n\nConfiguration file details\n==========================\n\nThis section covers all configuration file parameters, including those not covered\nin the Quick Start section.

Replace [command] with the\n   command you want help with.\n\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !help wiki\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``info``\n----------------\n\n::\n\n\n   info\n\n   Show general information about the bot, including but not limited to;\n\n   - Python package version\n   - Uptime (how long the bot has been running for)\n   - Installed plugins, both enabled and disabled\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !help info\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``quote``\n-----------------\n\n::\n\n\n   quote\n\n   Displays a random famous quote\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !quote\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``timezone``\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   timezone [timezone_name]\n\n   Set the timezone for the author of the discord message, allowing this\n   discord user to provide/see dates and times in their local timezone.\n\n   [timezone_name] should be replaced with the name of a timezone from the IANA\n   time zone database, or some substring, e.g. \"london\" or \"los angeles\". If you\n   live in a big city, then often just typing the name of the city here will be\n   enough. If you are having issues, however, try selecting your region on\n   this IANA timezone map, and using the country/city name that is shown in\n   the drop-down selection box: https://kevalbhatt.github.io/timezone-picker\n\n   Sending this command with no arguments will query the timezone currently\n   assigned to the author of the discord message.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !timezone           # Query timezone setting for this discord user\n   @BotName !timezone london    # Set timezone for this discord user to \"Europe/London\"\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``streamers``\n---------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   streamers\n\n   Shows a list of streamers currently being monitored.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !streamers\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``addstreamers``\n------------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   addstreamers [name] ...\n\n   Adds one or more new streamers to list of streamers being monitored. Replace\n   [name] with the twitch name(s) of the streamer(s) you want to monitor.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !addstreamers streamer1 streamer2 streamer3\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``removestreamers``\n---------------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   removestreamers [name] ...\n\n   Removes one or more streamers from the  list of streamers being monitored. Replace [name]\n   with the twitch name(s) of the streamer(s) you want to remove.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !removestreamers streamer1 streamer2 streamer3\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``clearallstreamers``\n-----------------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   clearallstreamers\n\n   Clears the list of streamers currently being monitored.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !clearallstreamers\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``phrases``\n-------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   phrases\n\n   Shows a numbered list of phrases currently in use for stream announcements.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !phrases\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``testphrases``\n-----------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   testphrases\n\n   Shows all phrases currently in use for stream announcements, with the format tokens\n   populated, so you can see what they will look like when posted to the discord channel.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !testphrases\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``addphrase``\n---------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   addphrase [phrase]\n\n   Adds a new phrase to be used for stream annnouncements.

[message_number] should be replaced\n   with the number of the message you want to remove, as shown by the output of running the\n   '!schedule' command with no arguments.\n\n   Alternatively, instead of passing numbers, you can pass a single argument of \"all\"\n   to remove all scheduled messages at once, or \"last\" to remove the most recently\n   added scheduled message.\n\n   Examples:\n\n   @BotName !unschedule last          # Remove last added message\n   @BotName !unschedule all           # Remove all messages\n   @BotName !unschedule 2             # Remove message #2\n   @BotName !unschedule 5 6           # Remove messages 5 and 6\n\n   Only discord users registered in 'discord_admin_users' in the bot configuration file may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``remindme``\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   remindme [reminder_text] in|on|at [time_description]\n\n   Set up a reminder. After the specified time, the bot will send you a DM with whatever\n   text you provided for [reminder_text].\n\n   [reminder_text] should be replaced with whatever text you want in the reminder message,\n   e.g. the thing that you want to be reminded of.\n\n   [time_description] should be replaced with a description of the desired time before\n   the reminder is delivered. The time can be described in one of the following ways:\n\n   - An absolute delay period written in english, using digits (e.g. \"5\") instead of\n     words (e.g. \"five\") for number values. For example: \"1 minute\", \"2 hours and 3 minutes\",\n     \"2hrs3mins\", \"2 hours & 3 minutes\"\n\n   - A specific date and time, written in one of the following formats:\n\n     * DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM\n     * YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM\n     * HH:MM DD/MM/YYYY\n     * HH:MM YYYY/MM/DD\n\n     NOTE: if you are using a specific date/time, you should first tell the bot which\n     timezone you are in using the \"!timezone\" command. That way, you can provide dates/times\n     in your local timezone. You only have to set your timezone once, the bot will\n     remember it (see \"@BotName !help timezone\" for more details about how to set your timezone).\n\n   Sending the command with no arguments returns the list of active reminders\n   for the user that sent the command.\n\n   Examples:\n\n   @BotName !remindme                                           # Query current reminders for me\n   @BotName !remindme To take out the trash... in 12 hours      # schedule reminder in 12 hours\n   @BotName !remindme to take a shower :D in 1 day and 5 mins   # Schedule reminder in 1 day and 5 minutes\n   @BotName !remindme to brush my teeth on 22/4/2025 14:30      # Schedule reminder at specific date & time\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``unremind``\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   unremind [reminder_number] [reminder_number] ...\n   unremind all\n   unremind last\n\n   Remove one or more reminders by number. [reminder_number] should be replaced with the\n   number of the reminder you want to remove, as shown by the output of running the\n   '!remindme' command with no arguments.\n\n   Alternatively, instead of passing numbers, you can pass a single argument of \"all\"\n   to remove all reminders at once, or \"last\" to remove the last reminder that you scheduled.\n\n   Examples:\n\n   @BotName !unremind last          # Remove last added reminder\n   @BotName !unremind all           # Remove all reminders\n   @BotName !unremind 2             # Remove reminder #2\n   @BotName !unremind 5 6           # Remove reminders 5 and 6\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``trivia``\n------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   trivia [time_limit]\n\n   Fetch a trivia question from opentdb.com and allow all discord users to provide\n   an answer until the time limit is up. Whoever provides the correct answer first\n   gets 2 points, and any other correct answers that came after that get 1 point.\n   If the correct answer is not provided, then no points are awarded.\n\n   [time_limit] should be replaced with the desired time limit for the question, in seconds.\n   This parameter is optional; if no time limit is provided then a time limit of 60 seconds\n   will be used.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !trivia\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``triviascores``\n------------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   triviascores\n\n   Shows total score for all discord users who have ever answered a trivia question correctly.\n   The first correct answer to a trivia question gets 2 points, and all other correct answers\n   get 1 point.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !triviascores\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``story``\n-----------------\n\n::\n\n\n   story new|add|continue|show|stop [optional story contribution text]\n\n   Interact with the story being written on the current discord channel.\n\n   The first argument to this command may be one of the following 5 operations:\n\n   new      - Start a new story in this channel.\n\n   add      - Contribute the next part of the story being written on this channel.\n              [optional story contribution text] should be replaced with your desired\n              text for the next part of the story.\n\n   continue - Instead of starting a new story with a random prompt, add to an existing\n              story by providing the whole story. [optional story contribution text]\n              should be replaced with the text of the story that you want to continue.\n              (Note: if your story is too large to fit in a single discord message,\n              you may need to start with a smaller portion of the story, and afterwards\n              add the remaining text using the '!story add' command)\n\n   show     - Show the current story as written so far.\n\n   stop     - Stop the story writing session, and show the story as written so far.\n\n   Examples:\n\n   @BotName !story new                            (Provide a random prompt to start a new story)\n   @BotName !story add And then he fell down...   (Contribute to the current story)\n   @BotName !story continue Call me Ishmael       (Start new story with provided text, no prompt)\n   @BotName !story show                           (Show the story as written so far)\n   @BotName !story stop                           (Stop the story)\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\nCommand ``socialcredit``\n------------------------\n\n::\n\n\n   socialcredit [top]\n\n   Show your social credit score.\n\n   The scoring algorithm is designed to favour users who interact regularly with the\n   server, as long as those interactions are not \"spread thinly\" throughout the server.\n\n   For example, posting a lot of messages in a single channel every day may make your score go up,\n   but posting one message in all channels very infrequently may make your score go down.\n\n   Using the command with no arguments shows your own social credit score. Using the command\n   with a single argument of \"top\" (e.g. \"!socialcredit top\") shows the 10 users with the highest\n   social credit score.\n\n   Example:\n\n   @BotName !socialcredit                 # Show your social credit score\n   @BotName !socialcredit top             # Show highest 10 scores\n\n   All discord users may use this command.\n\n\n\n",
