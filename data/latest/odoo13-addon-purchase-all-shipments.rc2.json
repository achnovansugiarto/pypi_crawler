This should include pickings associated to the procurements that generated the purchase, and also pickings that have been chained with push rules.\n\nThis is consistent with the \"sale\" module, where from the sale order the user can access the generated delivery and all chained ones.\n\nThe implementation uses the procurement group of the moves in the generated picking. The procurement group is always present in purchases, also when there is no procurement.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues/new?body=module:%20purchase_all_shipments%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Leonardo Pistone <leonardo.pistone@camptocamp.com>\n* Nicolas Mac Rouillon <nmr@adhoc.com.ar>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/purchase-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/tree/13.0/purchase_all_shipments>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
