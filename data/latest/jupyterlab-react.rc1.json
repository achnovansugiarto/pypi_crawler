The JupyterLab UI is built on the [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) widgets.\n\nThe end goal is to make easy to build a Jupyter frontend. This is not about a tool to develop JuyterLab extensions.\n\nWe are still experimenting, so do not expect formal APIs, primitives nor docs.\n\nA developer can evolve JupyterLab by adding or removing features (a.k.a. extensions) from the full application. But it is difficult to `start from a blank page` and add there components. To ease that goal, we have defined 3 steps.\n\n**Step 1 - Showcase to developers how to use the existing JupyterLab and Lumino components (Panels, Layouts, CSS, Icons, Widgets...)**\n\nYou already have today great resources to learn JupyterLab development. The [Lumino examples](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/tree/master/examples), the [JupyterLab examples](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/examples), the Astronomy Of the Day extension ([docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/extension_tutorial.html), [source](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_apod)), the [extension examples](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples) repository, [online tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFabWieskak), a [cookie-cutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts) to get you started with an extension...\n\nWe are now contributing a new ressource with a a [didactic Storybook](https://jupyterlab-react.datalayer.io) exposing the JupyterLab internals. That Storyboook is backed by a [Lumino Adapter](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/tree/main/packages/lumino-adapter) to expose Lumino in React and [Material UI Themes](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/tree/main/packages/themes) to provide a JupyterLab-like look-and-feel.\n\n**Step 2 - Build higher-level React components easy to use to embed in you React application or your favorite static web site generator ([Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)...)**\n\n```jsx\n<Notebook kernel=\"py3\">\n  <Cell text=\"print('Hello jupyterlab-react')\">\n</Notebook>\n```\n\nIn that quest, we need to connect as much as we can with the [Nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract) project that also delivers React.js based components for Jupyter, but without relying on JupyterLab (e.g. [cell.md](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/main/packages/presentational-components/src/components/cell.md), [cells.tsx](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/main/packages/stateful-components/src/cells/cells.tsx), [code-cell.tsx](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/main/packages/stateful-components/src/cells/code-cell.tsx)).\n\n**Step 3 - Build a React application that is a clone of the well-know [Classic Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) fueled by the `jupyterlab-react` components (which are fueled by `jupyterlab` underneath)**\n\nThat clone would have 100% features parity with the beloved classic notebook, would look-an-feel the same, should be as performant loading large notebooks. On top it should have features like [Real Time Collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc). We could name that `notebook2` or `notebook-next` or `notebook+`... and ensure a transparent migration for the notebook lovers.\n\nThis Step 3 should be done outside of this repository.\n\n## But... wait...\n\n1. *Why wrapping in yet-another-layer like React.js?* JupyterLab architecture is great, but Lumino widgets constructs needs a lot of line codes (see e.g. [this example](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/blob/938804120f58bf61e795bde9d596f6ce7573e920/examples/example-dockpanel/src/index.ts)) and is not widely adopted outside of the JupyterLab community. Exposing in a more standard UI toolkit should drive a wider adoption.\n\n2. *Why `jupyterlab-react` and not `juyterlab-react`?* We also need servers, kernels, so we are looking at backend, with for example [JupyterPool](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterpool) as well at frontend, hence the more generic `jupyterlab-react` name. \n\n3. *Hey, there is already a [single document mode to address classic notebook usage cases](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8531)...* We want to provide a transparent migration to the existing notebook users, as not providing a stripped-down version of JupyterLab.\n\n4. *Mmh, I have also seen the [simplest-notebook](https://github.com/yuvipanda/simplest-notebook)...* Great spot! This looks much like our target but still too closer from a stripped-down version of the existing JupyterLab.\n\n## Examples in a Storybook\n\nThe below picture is an example of [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) dock panels wrapped into a React.js component. Discover more examples on https://jupyterlab-react.datalayer.io.\n\n[![lumino-in-react](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/main/docs/source/images/lumino-in-react.png)](https://jupyterlab-react.datalayer.io/?path=/story/lumino-in-react-id--multiple-docs)\n\nYou can also launch a local storybook and hack on the source code.\n\n```bash\n# Clone, install and browse the storybook.\ngit clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react.git &&\n  cd jupyterlab-react && \\\n  make install && \\\n  make build && \\\n  make storybook\n```\n\nPlease open [Issues](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/issues) for questions, feature requests, bug reports...\n\nWe also welcome [Pull Requests](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/pulls).\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. *Should we support the [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and related [comms](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Low%20Level.html)?* Nteract [supports ipywidgets](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/4573) ([blog post](https://blog.nteract.io/the-nteract-january-2020-release-a430d50ac0fd), [docs for comm](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/main/packages/epics/docs/comms.md)).\n\n2. *Should we support [jupyter-output-spec](https://github.com/quansight-labs/jupyter-output-spec)?* There is already an [draft implemention for JupyterLab](https://github.com/blois/js-module-renderer).\n\n3. *Which React Toolkit to use*? We use for now [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) while monitoring other toolkits like [GitHub Primer](https://github.com/primer/components). Both JupyterLab and Nteract depends today on [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com).\n\n4. *What would be the Community Adoption?* React future in JupyterLab is still under discussion, see e.g.:\n\n- [Remove dependency on third-party library for ui-components](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6890)\n- [Future of ui-components package: drop Blueprint; should we use Material-UI](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/7574)\n- [Switch to material-ui](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6828)\n<!--\nOther systems part of the Jupyter ecosystem should be considered while integrating React into JupyterLab:\n\n- [IpyWidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) (Jupyter Widgets, Interactive Widgets for the Jupyter Notebook) integrates with JupyterLab via the [IpyWidgets Jupyterlab Manager](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/packages/jupyterlab-manager>) extension\n- [Nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract>) which is developed from scratch with React. Ntreact supports IpyWidgets via its [jupyter-widgets](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/jupyter-widgets) package\n-->\n<!--\n## Documentaation\n\nYou can find more details on the [documentation website](https://jupyterlab-react.readthedocs.io).\n-->\n## Trying Out\n\nYou can deploy the storybook in your [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (former Now.js) account. For this to work, configure a vercel `jupyterlab-react-storybook` project with:\n\n- Build command: `yarn run build:vercel`\n- Output directory: `storybook/.out`.\n\n[![vercel-settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/main/docs/source/images/vercel-settings.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datalayer/jupyterlab-react/main/docs/source/images/vercel-settings.png)\n\nThen run the following command.\n\n```bash \n# Deploy the storybook (if you have karma for).\nvercel --prod\n```\n\n## Read Also\n\n- [JupyterCon 2020: Creating JupyterLab Extensions - Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95JS8VeKH0M)\n<!--\n- [How do you engineer a JupyterLab React Component?](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6380)\n- [Track migration to components](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5702)\n- [[WIP] Add @jupyterlab/components package](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5538)\n- [Figure out if tree shaking is working with blueprint](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5601)\n- [Create a @jupyterlab/ui package based on Blueprint and possibly Material UI](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5170)\n- [Add ui package and refactor toolbars](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4234)\n- [How do you engineer a JupyterLab React Component?](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6380)\n- [Switch to material-ui](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6828)\n- [Remove dependency on third-party library for components](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6890)\n- [OUTDATED] [jupyterlab-react](https://github.com/timbr-io/jupyterlab-react)\n- [OUTDATED] [VDom IpyWidget](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/2039)\n- [OUTDATED] [VDom Ipywidget Repo](https://github.com/shoobomb/vdom_ipywidget)\n- [OUTDATED] [VDom Example](https://github.com/AaronWatters/jp_doodle/blob/master/notebooks/misc/wdom%20Example.ipynb)\n-->\n\n\n",
