Reading the various file formats required for EDGES data:\n   - VNA readings\n   - fastspec output\n   - thermistor readings\n   - field weather recordings\n   - field thermlog recordings\n2. Verifying and exploring databases of measurements in a robust and reliable way.\n\nFeatures\n========\nSome features currently implemented:\n\n* Verify a \"calibration observation\" quickly without reading any actual data, with\n  a nice command-line tool: ``edges-io check``.\n* Optionally apply various automatic _fixes_ to a calibration observation to bring\n  it into line with standard database layout.\n* Read ``acq``, ``h5``, ``mat`` and ``npz`` spectrum files seamlessly.\n* Read S1P files.\n* Verification of read data.\n* Intuitive class hierarchy so that any subset of an observation can be handled.\n* Read field-based weather and thermlog information\n\nInstallation\n============\nInstallation should be as simple as either one of the following::\n\n    $ pip install git+git://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io\n\nor, if you would like to develop ``edges-io`` and use it too::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io\n    $ cd edges-io\n    $ pip install -e .[dev]\n\nThere are a few dependencies, which should be installed automatically when following the\nabove command. If you are using ``conda`` (which is recommended) then you can obtain\na cleaner/faster install by doing the following::\n\n    $ conda create -n edges python=3\n    $ conda activate edges\n    $ conda install numpy scipy h5py\n\nAnd then following either of the above instructions.\n\nUsage\n=====\nYou can use ``edges-io`` either as a library or a command-line tool. The library is\nself-documented, so you can look at the docstring of any of the available functions.\nWe describe some basics of each approach here.\n\nCLI\n---\nTo run the checking tool, simply do::\n\n    $ edges-io check PATH\n\n``PATH`` should be the top-level directory of a calibration observation (i.e. a folder\nthat has a sub-folder ``25C/``, which has subfolders ``Spectra/``, ``Resistance/`` and\n``S11`` etc.).\nThere are a few options you can use, for example changing the temperature of the observation,\nand enabling automatic fixes. The latter can be achieved simply with the ``--fix`` flag.\nIf you find that a particular kind of error happens regularly,\n`make an issue <https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io/issues/new>`_ so we can add the\nfix.\n\nLibrary\n-------\nThe library is useful for gathering an entire observation and performing operations\non its data. The library exposes a hierarchy of calibration objects, including base\nobjects like a ``Spectrum``, ``Resistance`` or ``S1P`` file, and container objects\nlike ``Spectra`` or ``S11``. An entire observation can be loaded as a\n``CalibrationObservation``, and it contains references to all children.\n\nFor example::\n\n    >>> from edges_io import io\n    >>> obs = io.CalibrationObservation(\"path_to_observation\")\n    >>> print(obs.s11.path)\n    \"path_to_observation/25C/S11\"\n    >>> print(obs.spectra.ambient.path)\n    \"path_to_observation/25C/Spectra/Ambient_XXX.acq\"\n    >>> ambient_spectrum = obs.spectra.ambient.read()\n\nSee how ``edges-io`` is used in\n`edges-cal <https://github.com/edges-collab/cal_coefficients/tree/master/src/edges_cal/cal_coefficients.py>`_\nfor a more involved example.\n\nDefining Observations\n---------------------\nOne of the main goals of ``edges-io`` is to make the definition of a \"Calibration\nObservation\" as clear, robust and error-free as possible. Many files go into any\nparticular observation -- spectra, resistance measurements and S11 measurements -- which\nare all required to form together a calibration solution (which can then be applied\nindependently to field data). This code provides a clear structure for how these files\n*must* be laid out in order for them to be read and used automatically. This is done in\na formal sense in `this document <docs/structure.rst>`_, but is also implemented within\nthe code itself.\n\nIn the above document, the specification is laid out as formally as possible, and that\ndocument has the final word on what is allowable. However, this can mean it's a bit hard\nto interpret, and so we here present a \"simpler\" guide to what constitutes a \"Calibration\nObservation\".\n\nA single natural \"Observation\" (see below for how to combine multiple observations into\na single \"virtual\" observation) is a single directory with multiple files/subdirectories\nin it. That directory must be named under a certain convention that time-stamps it and\ngives some useful metadata of the observation (like which receiver number was measured).\nIt is possible that in the future, a metadata file within the observation will specify\nmost of this information, but it is also useful to have a unique label for the observation.\n\nOne question that is important in all of this definition is what to do when either 1)\na file exists that shouldn't be there, or 2) a file doesn't exist that *should* be\nthere. It may be tempting to overlook extra files that shouldn't be there. However,\nthey can be a source of error. For example, spectra can be split across multiple files,\nand we use a file pattern to find the files that should be read in. If an extra file\nthat \"shouldn't be there\" exists and the file pattern matches it, then errors can occur\n(even worse if the contents of that file are able to be read by the spectrum reader, but\ncorrespond to a different load or something of that sort, where the results will be wrong,\nbut no error raised). Thus, when *checking* the integrity of an observation we flag\nextra files as *errors*, and require the user to fix them up. To make this a bit easier,\nand let those files stay in the directory (so we don't lose potentially valuable information),\none of a few extensions can be added to the extra file:\n\n  * ``.old``: for files that contain valid data but that is superseded by newer measurements\n    and should be ignored,\n  * ``.invalid``: for data that has something wrong with it (equipment broken, wrong input\n    parameters, etc.),\n  * ``.ignore``: files to ignore for any other reason.\n\nIf the file does not have one of these extensions, and is not in the list of accepted\nfiles for the Observation, an error will be raised by the checker.\n\nOn the other hand, if a file is *missing* that must be there, different things can happen\nin different situations. The default case is to treat this as a warning, which may be\ncounter-intuitive (surely missing a required file should be an error?!). The reason for\nthis is that that file may be supplemented by a different Observation. Perhaps this\nObservation is incomplete  -- maybe all the data that was taken was a single set of\nSpectra, which is supposed to complement a previous observation which had a full set\nof measurements. In this case, while the \"natural\" Observation is incomplete, it is not\nnecessary to give an error, as long as a warning is given such that it must be combined\nwith another observation. Nevertheless, some combinations of files are required to have\nbeen taken in the same physical observation to ensure consistency (namely, S11 measurements\nfor each standard in a given load). If particular standards are missing, an error will\nbe raised.\n\nThese caveats should be kept in mind as we talk about \"required\" directories/files below.\n\"Required\" will mean that after combining all the observations that we want/need (see\nnext section), we require this particular file.\n\nWithin the top-level observation directory are a number of directories denoting the ambient temperature at\nwhich the observation was taken. These will usually be 15C, 25C or 35C. Most newer\nobservations are at 25C. One should never mix files between different ambient temperatures.\nThus, in reality, an observation is contained within one of *these* folders, and in practice,\nthe ``CalibrationObservation`` has its ``path`` attribute set to the temperature directory.\n\nInside this directory can be up to two files, and exactly three folders. One of the files\nis a ``Notes.txt`` file which summarises human-readable notes about the observation (\"we\nran the ambient spectra first, but had a delay because of xxx...\"). The other file is named\n``definition.yaml`` and includes metadata about the observation in a specific format\n(this file also allows you to supplement the observation with other observations, but\nwe'll get to that later). Measurements/data like the male/female resistance should be\nput in here (til now they have been found somewhere an input manually by the analyst\nwhen doing the calibration, which is very risky and prone to error -- they are properly\npart of the measurement itself, not a choice of the analyst).\n\nThe three folders are ``Spectra``, ``Resistance`` and ``S11``. Note that an observation\nmust have all three of these (and nothing else, after combining observations).\n\nWithin ``Spectra`` exist a bunch of spectra taken over about 12-24 hours for each of\nfour \"calibration sources\" in the lab: they are \"Ambient\", \"HotLoad\", \"LongCableOpen\"\nand \"LongCableShorted\" (often referred to as their simple aliases \"ambient\", \"hot_load\",\n\"open\" and \"short\" in the code). These spectra will be in either ``.acq`` or ``.h5``\nformat, depending on the version of ``fastspec`` that took the measurements. Due to the\nway ``fastspec`` takes its data, each source may have multiple files for a single\nmeasurement (each integration is saved to a new line in the file, but a new file is\ncreated at particular local times each day). Thus, typically one would like to read in\nand concatenate _all_ the files for that load, to use all the data.\nBeyond this, it is _possible_ that two fully separate \"runs\" for a given source/load\nwill be made. In this case, an identifier for the \"run number\" is put into the filename.\nOnly one run number is actually used to do any particular calibration. In practice, it\nis *very rare* to have more than one \"useable\" run number for any particular load.\nTypically, a second run is only taken if it is deemed necessary due to the first being\ninvalid in some way. If this is the case, this should be noted in the ``Notes.txt``\nand/or the ``definition.yaml``.\n\nThe ``Resistance`` folder is almost exactly the same as the ``Spectra``. Each of the\nsources is represented here again (with the same names), and the filename format is the\nsame, except that the files themselves are all ``.csv``. These measure the resistance\nreadings of the sources, which are used to derive the physical temperatures of the loads\n(against which the spectra are calibrated). Again, each source is allowed to have\nmultiple \"runs\" specified by their \"run number\". However, again in practice it is\nvery uncommon to have more than one usable run.\n\nThe ``S11`` folder contains measurements of the reflection coefficients of the sources,\nalong with the LNA itself and the internal switch. These are all made with a VNA, and\neach reading takes of order a minute. Thus, multiple readings of these measurements can\nbe taken -- and typically are taken. Inside the ``S11`` folder exist a folder for each\nof the main loads (or sources), in which are measurements of the four standards (``open``,\n``short``, ``match`` and ``external``). Each of these standards can be measured multiple\ntimes, and so each file has the format ``<standard-name><rep-num>.s1p``, where ``rep-num``\ngoes from 1 - 99. However, each of the standards for a load is measured one after the\nother on the same connection (i.e. there is no disconnection between them, to avoid\nissues with different connection characteristics between the standards). Thus, one can't\nchoose to use repeat number 01 for ``open`` and repeat number 2 for ``short`` for the ``Ambient``\nsource. For a given source, all standards used must be of the same repeat number (but multiple\nruns can *exist* for the source).\nBesides the S11's of the sources, we also need measurements of the LNA reflections, and\nthe internal switch. These exist in the folders ``ReceiverReadingXX`` and ``SwitchingStateXX``\nrespectively. Here the ``XX`` correspond to what we call a \"run\" number, which\ncorrespond to a complete re-measuring of the standards at different points in the\nobservation process. An arbitrary number of these can be performed (up to 99), but only\none is required.\n\nIn all cases, the default behaviour of ``edges-io`` is to use the *last* run number and\nrepeat number available for any given measurement.\n\nCombining Multiple Observations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAs of v0.4.0, ``CalibrationObservation`` objects no longer need to be defined fully by\none directory containing all measurements. While that is still an option (and the easiest\nway to define a calibration observation), they can also be defined in a more sophisticated\nway internally or externally.\n\nInternally, a ``definition.yaml`` file is allowed (and encouraged) which defines properties of the\nobservation, and also has ``include`` and ``prefer`` keywords which are used to supplement\nor override any particular parts of the observation. For example ``include`` could point\nto the top-level of any other observation, which could then be used whenever the\nmain observation lacks data. If this file exists, by default it is used to construct\nthe full observation virtually. An incomplete example of such a definition file can\nbe found `here <example-obs-definition.yaml>`_.\n\n\nExternally, a different file format is used to explicitly define every single measurement\nfile in an observation. This is supposed to be exhaustive and complete to make it\nunambiguous. An example can be found in the `test-suite <tests/test_data/observation.yaml>`_.\nOne can use such a file to create a ``CalibrationObservation`` by using the\n``CalibrationObservation.from_observation_yaml()`` function.\n\nThe way the code actually handles these \"virtual\" observations is essentially to create\na temporary directory and make symlinks to all the files that are required. This virtual\nobservation then looks and feels like a normal single observation, but is in fact\npatched together from various observations.\n\nUsing the ``HDF5Object``\n------------------------\n``edges-io`` contains a convenient ``HDF5Object`` class whose purpose is to make working\nwith HDF5 files a bit more formal (and arguably more simple). By subclassing it, you\ncan specify an exact file layout that can be verified on read, to ensure a file is\nin the correct format (not just HDF5, but that it has the correct data structures and\ngroups and metadata).\n\nUsing such a class is meant to provide a very thin wrapper over the file. So, for instance\nif you have a file ``my_hdf5_format_file.h5``, whose structure is defined by the class\n``CustomH5Format``, you can create an object like this::\n\n    >>> fl = CustomH5Format(\"my_hdf5_format_file.h5\")\n\nDirectly on creation, the file will be checked for compatibility and return an error\nif it contains extraneous keys, or lacks keys that it requires.\n\nOnce created, the ``fl`` variable now has operations which can \"look into\" the file\nand load its data. It supports lazy-loading, so doing::\n\n    >>> print(fl['dataset'].max())\n\nwill load the 'dataset' data, and get the maximum, but it will not keep the data in\nmemory, and will not load any other datasets. If you have data in groups, you can\neasily do::\n\n    >>> print(fl['group']['dataset'].min())\n\nTo load the data into the object permanently use the ``.load`` method::\n\n    >>> fl.load('group')\n\nIn fact, doing this will load all data under 'group'. If you just wanted to load\n\"dataset\" out of \"group\"::\n\n    >>> fl['group'].load('dataset')\n\nAn example of how to define a subclass of ``HDF5Object`` can be seen in the\n``HDF5RawSpectrum`` class, which is used to define ``fastspec`` output files.\n\nHow the code works in a bit more detail\n---------------------------------------\nFor the sake of developers (lets face it, most users of this particular repo should also\nbe developers), we will try to explain in a little more detail how the code works here.\nThis will focus on how the code treats the organization of a calibration observation,\nand how it performs checks and makes fixes.\n\nThe basic idea is that each directory, and each kind of file, is represented by a\ndistinct class, describing that kind of thing. For example, the top-level directory\n(actually, the top-level plus the ambient temperature directory) is represented by the\n``CalibrationObservation`` class, while the ``Spectra`` directory is represented by the\n``Spectra`` class, and S1P files are represented by the ``S1P`` class.\n\nAll of these classes are subclasses either of ``_DataContainer`` (if it's a folder) or\n``_DataFile`` (if it's a file). All of them have a ``path`` attribute which points to its\nown path on-disk. ``_DataFile`` classes are much simpler, and typically only know how to\ncheck its own filename for consistency with the specification, and how to read the data\nin that particular filetype (they know nothing about their parents).\n``_DataContainer`` classes know about their own ``path``,\nbut also can determine a list of files/subfolders they *contain* (they know nothing about their\nparents), and know how to map these files/folders onto their relevant defining classes.\nThey are able to check their own path for consistency, ensure that all relevant sub-files\nexist, ensure that none extra exist, and recursively check the consistency of their\nsub-files and folders by calling their checking methods.\nEach file and folder in the observation becomes a specific *instance* of one of these\nclasses (there will be multiple ``S1P`` instances for all of the S11 measurements, and\neach may have a different ``name`` attribute to identify the standard it represents).\n\nThis top-down hierarchical structure is useful, and similar the to the way Unix filesystems\noperate. However, it does mean that a particular instance is not necessarily unique: the\n\"match\" standard S11 will exist within all sources, and since each class doesn't know\nits parent, the ``Ambient/Match01.s1p`` cannot be distinguished from the ``HotLoad/Match01.s1p``.\nHowever, a method exists on the top-level ``CalibrationObservation`` which can match a\nparticular input path to a unique *sequence* of instances which do uniquely define it\n(i.e. the first would be a sequence containing a ``LoadS11`` class with ``name=Ambient``\nand the second would contain a ``LoadS11`` class with ``name=HotLoad``).\n\nAnother thing to note about the setup is the different between the classes and *instances*\nof those classes. Much of the functionality of the system is implemented just through\nthe classes themselves -- one does not need to make instances of the classes to perform\nthe filesystem checks, for instance. In this case, the ``path`` is given to the ``check()``\nmethod of the class, eg. ``CalibrationObservation.check(path)``, which itself will\ncall the ``check`` method of any of its children etc. This will never read any data, it\nwill just check filename formats and contents of directories. However, one can make an\n*instance* of the ``CalibrationObservation``, which will itself go and make instances\nof all its children, storing them in the top-level class in a nice hierarchical way, in\nwhich each of the children can be used independently. By default, when you create such\nan instance, it will first perform the full check that would have been performed (but\nin this case it should exit at the first error raised, and raise it as an error, rather\nthan continuing and printing all errors). Notably, these instances can be used to *read*\nthe data in the files themselves. The instance will also decide *which* files to use\nin the observation (i.e. which run numbers and repeat numbers).\n\n\n\nNote\n====\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3.
