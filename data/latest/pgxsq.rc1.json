    "description": "# pgxsq\n\npgxsq simplifies writing [Postgres extensions] \\(especially those relying on\n[procedural languages]) by managing changes with [Sqitch].\n\nTracking changes in Postgres extensions is not easy.  Updating procedures or\nviews requires copying the defintion and make the necessary changes.  This has\na major drawback: the changes made are not obvious without resorting to `diff`.\nWouldn't it be great to track changes in version control and use, for example,\njust `git diff` to see what changes were made?\n\npgxsq allows that by tracking changes with [Sqitch] and generating extension\nscripts from those changes.  Changes are made by [reworking][sqitch-rework]\nthe scripts that define the extension objects.  Sqitch caries out the grunt\nwork of tracking the original script version so that the script can be modified\nand tracked in version control.  pgxsq builds the extension update paths from\nthe Sqitch [tags][sqitch-tag] that are required for reworking.\n\n\n## Example\n\nThis repository contains an [example](example) that shows the steps from\ncreating the Sqitch project to making changes to installing the extension.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with `pip`:\n\n    pip install pgxsq\n\nInstall from source:\n\n    make install\n\nYou also need to [install][sqitch-download] Sqitch to create projects and use\npgxsq.\n\n\n## Development\n\n    make\n\n\n[Postgres extensions]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html\n[procedural languages]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xplang.html\n[Sqitch]: https://sqitch.org\n[sqitch-download]: https://sqitch.org/download/\n[sqitch-rework]: https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-rework/\n[sqitch-tag]: https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-rework/\n",
