For instance, it takes just eight lines of code to run a pure tone audiogram using an adaptive staircase:\n```python\nimport slab\nstimulus = slab.Sound.tone(frequency=500, duration=0.5) # make a 0.5 sec pure tone of 500 Hz\nstairs = slab.Staircase(start_val=50, n_reversals=10) # set up the adaptive staircase\nfor level in stairs: # the staircase object returns a value between 0 and 50 dB for each trial\n    stimulus.level = level\n    stairs.present_tone_trial(stimulus) # plays the tone and records a keypress (1 for 'heard', 2 for 'not heard')\nprint(stairs.threshold()) # print threshold when done\n```\n\nWhy slab?\n---------\nThe package aims to lower the entrance barrier for working with sounds in Python and provide easy access to typical operations in psychoacoustics, specifically for students and researchers in the life sciences. The typical BSc or MSc student entering our lab has limited programming and signal processing training and is unable to implement a psychoacoustic experiment from scratch within the time limit of a BSc or MSc thesis. Slab solves this issue by providing easy-to-use building blocks for such experiments. The implementation is well documented and sufficiently simple for curious students to understand. All functions provide sensible defaults and will many cases 'just work' without arguments (vowel = slab.Sound.vowel() gives you a 1-second synthetic vowel 'a', vowel.spectrogram() plots the spectrogram). This turned out to be useful for teaching and demonstrations. Many students in our lab have now used the package to implement their final projects and exit the lab as proficient Python programmers.\n\nFeatures\n--------\nSlab represents sounds as [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) arrays and provides classes and methods to perform typical sound manipulation tasks and psychoacoustic procedures. The main classes are:\n\n**Signal**: Provides a generic signal object with properties duration, number of samples, sample times, number of channels. Keeps the data in a 'data' property and implements slicing, arithmetic operations, and conversion between sample points and time points.\n```python\nsig = slab.Sound.pinknoise(n_channels=2) # make a 2-channel pink noise\nsig.duration\n# 1.0\nsig.n_samples\n# 8000\nsig2 = sig.resample(samplerate=4000) # resample to 4 kHz\nenv = sig2.envelope() # returns a new signal containing the lowpass Hilbert envelopes of both channels\nsig.delay(duration=0.0006, channel=0) # delay the first channel by 0.6 ms\n```\n\n**Sound**: Inherits from Signal and provides methods for generating, manipulating, displaying, and analysing sound stimuli. Can compute descriptive sound features and apply manipulations to all sounds in a folder.<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup>\n```python\nvowel = slab.Sound.vowel(vowel='a', duration=.5) # make a 0.5-second synthetic vowel sound\nvowel.play() # play the sound\nvowel = vowel.ramp() # apply default raised-cosine onset and offset ramps\nvowel = vowel.filter(kind='bp', frequency=[50, 3000]) # apply bandpass filter between 50 and 3000 Hz\nvowel.spectrogram() # plot the spectrogram\nvowel.spectrum(low_cutoff=100, high_cutoff=4000, log_power=True) # plot a band-limited spectrum\nvowel.waveform(start=0, end=.1) # plot the waveform\nvowel.write('vowel.wav') # save the sound to a WAV file\nvocoded_vowel = vowel.vocode() # run a vocoding algorithm\nvocoded_vowel.play() # play the vocoded sound\nvowel.spectral_feature(feature='centroid') # compute the spectral centroid of the sound in Hz\n# [1016.811]\n```\n\n**Binaural**: Inherits from Sound and provides methods for generating and manipulating binaural sounds, including advanced interaural time and intensity manipulation. Binaural sounds have left and a right channel properties.\n```python\nsig = slab.Binaural.pinknoise()\nsig = sig.pulse() # make a 2-channel pulsed pink noise\nsig.n_channels\n# 2\nright_lateralized = sig.itd(duration=600e-6) # add an interaural time difference of 600 µsec, right channel leading\n# apply a linearly increasing or decreasing interaural time difference.\n# This is achieved by sinc interpolation of one channel with a dynamic delay:\nmoving = sig.itd_ramp(from_itd=-0.001, to_itd=0.01)\nhrtf = slab.HRTF.kemar() # using the default head-related transfer function\nlevel_spectrum = slab.Binaural.make_interaural_level_spectrum(hrtf) # compute frequency-band-specific ILDs from KEMAR\nlateralized = sig.at_azimuth(azimuth=-45, ils=level_spectrum) # add frequency-dependent ITD and ILD corresponding to a sound at 45 deg\nexternal = lateralized.externalize() # add an under-sampled HRTF filter that results in the percept of an external source\n# (i.e. outside of the head), defaults to the KEMAR HRTF recordings, but any HRTF can be supplied\n```\n\n**Filter**: Inherits from Signal and provides methods for generating, measuring, and manipulating FIR and FFT filters, filter banks, and transfer functions.\n```python\nsig = slab.Sound.whitenoise()\nfilt = slab.Filter.band(frequency=2000, kind='hp') # make a highpass filter\nfilt.tf() # plot the transfer function\nsig_filt = filt.apply(sig) # apply it to a sound\n# applying a whole filterbank is equally easy:\nfbank = slab.Filter.cos_filterbank(length=sig.n_samples, bandwidth=1/10, low_cutoff=100) # make a cosine filter bank\nfbank.tf() # plot the transfer function of all filters in the bank\nsubbands = fbank.apply(sig) # make a multi-channel sound containing the passbands of the filters in the filter bank\nsubbands.spectrum(low_cutoff=90) # each band is limited by the corresponding fbank filter\n# the subbands could now be manipulated and then combined with the collapse_subbands method\nfbank.filter_bank_center_freqs() # return the centre frequencies of the filters in the filter bank\nfbank = slab.Filter.equalizing_filterbank(reference, measured) # generate inverse filters to minimize the difference\n# between measured signals and a reference sound. Used to equalize loudspeakers, microphones, or speaker arrays.\n# measured is typically a recorded signal (potentially multi-channel), and reference for instance a flat white noise.\nfbank.save('equalizing_filters.npy') # saves the filter bank as .npy file.\n```\n\n**HRTF**: Inherits from Filter, reads .sofa format HRTFs and provides methods for manipulating, plotting, and applying head-related transfer functions.\n```python\nhrtf = slab.HRTF.kemar() # load in-built KEMAR HRTF\nprint(hrtf) # print information\n# <class 'hrtf.HRTF'> sources 710, elevations 14, samples 710, samplerate 44100.0\nsourceidx = hrtf.cone_sources(20) # select sources on a cone of confusion at 20 deg from midline\nhrtf.plot_sources(sourceidx) # plot the sources in 3D, highlighting the selected sources\nhrtf.plot_tf(sourceidx,ear='left') # plot transfer functions of selected sources in a waterfall plot\ndtf = hrtf.diffuse_field_equalization() # apply diffuse field equalization to remove non-spatial components of the HRTF\n```\n\n**Psychoacoustics**: A collection of classes for working trial sequences, adaptive staircases, forced-choice procedures, stimulus presentation and response recording from the keyboard and USB button boxes, handling of precomputed stimulus lists, results files, and experiment configuration files.\n```python\n# set up an 1up-2down adaptive weighted staircase with dynamic step sizes:\nstairs = slab.Staircase(start_val=30, max_val=40, n_up=1, n_down=2,\n                            step_sizes=[3, 1], step_up_factor=1.5)\nfor trial in stairs: # draw a value from the staircase; the loop terminates with the staircase\n    response = stairs.simulate_response(25) # simulate a response from a participant using a psychometric function\n    print(f'trial # {stairs.this_trial_n}: intensity {trial}, response {response}')\n    stairs.add_response(response) # logs the response and advances the staircase\n    stairs.plot() # updates a plot of the staircase in each trial to keep an eye on the performance of the listener\nstairs.reversal_intensities # returns a list of stimulus values at the reversal points of the staircase\nstairs.threshold() # computes and returns the final threshold\nstairs.save_json('stairs.json') # the staircase object can be saved as a human readable json file\n\n# for non-adaptive experiments and all other cases where you need a controlled sequence of stimulus values:\ntrials = slab.Trialsequence(conditions=5, n_reps=2) # sequence of 5 conditions, repeated twice, without direct repetitions\ntrials = slab.Trialsequence(conditions=['red', 'green', 'blue'], kind='infinite') # infinite sequence of color names\ntrials = slab.Trialsequence(conditions=3, n_reps=20, deviant_freq=0.12) # stimulus sequence for an oddball design\ntrials.transitions() # return the array of transition probabilities between all combinations of conditions.\ntrials.condition_probabilities() # return a list of frequencies of conditions\nfor trial in trials: # use the trials object in a loop to go through the trials\n    print(trial) # here you would generate or select a stimulus according to the condition\n    trials.present_afc_trial(target, distractor, isi=0.2) # present a 2-alternative forced-choice trial and record the response\n\nstims = slab.Precomputed(lambda: slab.Sound.pinknoise(), n=10) # make 10 instances of noise as one Sound-like object\nstims = slab.Precomputed([stim1, stim2, stim3, stim4, stim5]) # or use a list of sound objects, or a list comprehension\nstims.play() # play a random instance\nstims.play() # play another one, guaranteed to be different from the previous one\nstims.sequence # the sequence of instances played so far\nstims.write('stims.zip') # save the sounds as zip file of wavs\nstims = slab.Precomputed.read('stims.zip') # reloads the file into a Precomputed object\n```\n\n<b id=\"f1\">1)</b> The basic functionality of the Signal class and some of the sound generation methods in the Sound class were based on the brian.hears Sound class (now [brian2hears](https://brian2hears.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an auditory modelling package). [↩](#a1)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall the current stable release from the python package index with pip:\n```pip install slab```\n\n### Other requirements ###\n\nOn *Linux*, there is only one requirement outside of Python: you may need to install *libsndfile* using your distribution’s package manager, for instance:\n\n```sudo apt-get install libsndfile1```\n\nOn Macs with M1 processors, the SoundCard module that slab uses to play and record sounds is currently not working. You can workaround this issue by uninstalling SoundCard:\n\n```pip uninstall soundcard```\n\nSlab will fall back to `afplay` to play sounds. Recording sounds directly from slab is not possible in this case.\n\nOther optional requirements can be installed by telling pip which extras you want:\n\n```pip install slab[name_of_extra]```\n\nThe options for `name_of_extra` are:\n- `windows`: if you are running Windows - this will install windows-curses for you, which is required for getting button presses in the psychoacoustics classes,\n- `hrtf`: if you want to use spatial stimuli with the `Binaural` and `HRTF` classes,\n- `testing`: (for developers) if you want to run the unit tests for slab, and\n- `docs`: (for developers) if you want to build the documentation locally.\n\nYou can combine these options: `pip install slab[windows, hrtf]` if you are on Windows and use spatial sounds.\n\nDetailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://slab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#installation).\n\nYou can also get the latest development version directly from GitHub (if you have [git](https://git-scm.com)) by running:\n```pip install git+https://github.com/DrMarc/slab.git```\n\nThe releases use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): major.minor.patch, where `major` increments for changes that break backwards compatibility, `minor` increments for added functionality, and `patch` increments for internal bug fixes.\n```slab.__version__``` prints the installed version.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nRead the tutorial-style documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://slab.readthedocs.io/).\n\nCiting slab\n-----------\n\nSchönwiesner et al., (2021). s(ound)lab: An easy to learn Python package for designing and running psychoacoustic experiments.
