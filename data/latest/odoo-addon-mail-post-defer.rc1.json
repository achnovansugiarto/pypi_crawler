During that time,\nyou can still delete the message and start again.\n\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.\n   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.\n   `More details on development status <https://odoo-community.org/page/development-status>`_\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nYou need to do nothing. The module is configured appropriately out of the box.\n\nThe mail queue processing is made by a cron job. This is normal Odoo behavior,\nnot specific to this module. However, since you will start using that queue for\nevery message posted by any user in any thread, this module configures that job\nto execute every minute by default.\n\nYou can still change that cadence after installing the module (although it is\nnot recommended). To do so:\n\n#. Log in with an administrator user.\n#. Activate developer mode.\n#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*.\n#. Edit the action named \"Mail: Email Queue Manager\".\n#. Lower down the frequency in the field *Execute Every*. Recommended: 1 minute.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. Go to the form view of any record that has a mail thread. It can be a partner, for example.\n#. Post a message.\n\nThe mail is now in the outgoing mail queue. It will be there for at least 30\nseconds. It will be really sent the next time the \"Mail: Email Queue Manager\"\ncron job is executed.\n\nWhile the message has not been yet sent:\n\n#.  Hover over the little envelope. You will see a paper airplane icon,\n    indicating it is still outgoing.\n#.  Hover over the message and click on the little trash icon to delete it.\n    Mails will not be sent.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n*   Add minimal deferring time configuration if it ever becomes necessary. See\n    https://github.com/OCA/social/pull/1001#issuecomment-1461581573 for the\n    rationale behind current hardcoded value of 30 seconds.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/social/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/social/issues/new?body=module:%20mail_post_defer%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Moduon\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Jairo Llopis (https://www.moduon.team/)\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-Yajo| image:: https://github.com/Yajo.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/Yajo\n    :alt: Yajo\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-Yajo| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/social <https://github.com/OCA/social/tree/15.0/mail_post_defer>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
