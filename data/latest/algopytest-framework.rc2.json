    "description": "# AlgoPytest — Framework for Testing Algorand Smart Contracts using PyTest\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/DamianB-BitFlipper/algopytest/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=0O7EP3YOB0)](https://codecov.io/gh/DamianB-BitFlipper/algopytest)\n\n*AlgoPytest* is a Pytest plugin framework which hides away all of the complexity and repetitiveness that comes with testing Algorand Smart Contracts. \n\nA lot of boilerplate code is necessary in order to setup a suitable test environment. *AlgoPytest* takes care of all that. It handles deploying the smart contract, creating and funding any necessary user accounts and then using those accounts to interact with the smart contract itself. Additionally, each test is a run in a freshly deployed smart contract, facilitating a clean slate which prevents any stateful interference from any previously run tests. \n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe most relevant information needed for getting off the ground are:\n- [Read-The-Docs documentation](https://algopytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Simplified Usage](#simplified-usage)\n- [Demos](#demos)\n\nThis project's Read-The-Docs page is especially useful, since it lists and describes all of the available methods and fixtures provided to you by *AlgoPytest*.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3 and `pip`\n- Install the Algorand [sandbox](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox).\n\n### Installing AlgoPytest\n```bash\npip install algopytest-framework\n```\n\n## Simplified Usage\nMake sure the sandbox is up and running. Preferably use a local network for your testing such as `dev`.\n```bash\n# Spin up the `dev` network\n./sandbox up dev\n```\n---\nSet any necessary environment variables. \n```bash\n# The path to your sandbox so that AlgoPytest may interact with the sandbox\nexport SANDBOX_DIR=/path/to/installation/of/sandbox/\n\n# The address in your `sandbox` which was allocated the initial funds\nexport INITIAL_FUNDS_ACCOUNT=4BJAN3J32NDMZJWU3DPIPGCPBQIUTXL3UB2LEG5Z3CFPRJZOOZC2GH5DMQ\n```\n- List of environment variables recognized by *AlgoPytest*: [documentation](https://algopytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html).\n\n----\nCreate a `conftest.py` file in your Pytest `tests` directory and define a fixture deploying a smart contract as so:\n\n```python\n# File: conftest.py\nimport pytest\nfrom algopytest import create_app\n\n# Load the smart contracts from this project. The path to find these\n# imports can be set by the environment variable `$PYTHONPATH`.\n# e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=.../smart-contract-project/assets`\nfrom approval_program import approval_program\nfrom clear_program import clear_program\n\n# NOTE: It is critical to `yield` the `app_id` so that the clean up is properly performed.\n# The `owner` is an automatically available AlgoPytest defined fixture \n@pytest.fixture\ndef smart_contract_id(owner):\n    with create_app(\n            owner,\n            approval_program=diploma_program(), \n            clear_program=clear_program(),\n            local_bytes=1,\n            local_ints=1,\n            global_bytes=1,        \n    ) as app_id:\n        yield app_id\n```\n\nNow, any Pytest tests you write automatically have access to the standard *AlgoPytest* fixtures as well as your defined `smart_contract_id`. Additionally, you can import and utilize the various helper functions that ship with the framework.\n\n- List of available fixtures: [documentation](https://algopytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixtures.html)\n- Provided helper functions: [documentation](https://algopytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algopytest.html)\n----\nA simple test to make sure that the creator of the smart contract can update the application is provided below. It uses the *AlgoPytest* fixture `owner`, your defined `smart_contract_id` fixture and the helper function `update_app`.\n\n```python\n# File: test_behavior.py\ndef test_update_from_owner(owner, smart_contract_id):\n    update_app(owner, smart_contract_id)\n```\n\n## Demos\n\nThis *AlgoPytest* project includes [demos](https://algopytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos.html) of Algorand Smart Contract projects that utilize this package to implement their test suite. These demo projects give examples of how a real-world project may use *AlgoPytest* for its testing. They provide greater context for how to integrate *AlgoPytest* into your project. The tests and the `initialization` code of the demos may be found within their respective `tests` directory. Therein, you will see how the fixtures are used to extensively stress test the Smart Contract code and life-cycle. \n\nFor example, a semi-involved test in one of the demos, [algo-diploma](https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/algo-diploma), showcases *AlgoPytest* utilizing the power of Pytest fixtures:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef owner_in(owner, smart_contract_id):\n    \"\"\"Create an ``owner`` fixture that has already opted in to ``smart_contract_id``.\"\"\"\n    opt_in_app(owner, smart_contract_id)\n    \n    # The test runs here\n    yield owner\n\n    # Clean up by closing out of the application\n    close_out_app(owner, smart_contract_id)\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef user1_in(user1, smart_contract_id):\n    \"\"\"Create a ``user1`` fixture that has already opted in to ``smart_contract_id``.\"\"\"\n    opt_in_app(user1, smart_contract_id)\n\n    # The test runs here\n    yield user1\n\n    # Clean up by closing out of the application\n    close_out_app(user1, smart_contract_id)\n\ndef test_issue_diploma(owner_in, user1_in, smart_contract_id):\n    diploma_metadata = \"Damian Barabonkov :: MIT :: BSc Computer Science and Engineering :: 2020\"\n\n    # The application arguments and account to be passed in to \n    # the smart contract as it expects\n    app_args = ['issue_diploma', diploma_metadata]\n    accounts = [user1_in.address]\n\n    # Issue the `diploma_metadata` to the recipient `user1`\n    call_app(owner_in, smart_contract_id, app_args=app_args, accounts=accounts)\n```\n\nOriginal source may be found [here](https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/algo-diploma/blob/master/tests/test_interaction.py).\n\n## Detailed Usage\nRefer to the [Pytest Documentation References](#pytest-documentation-references) below for more specific explanations of key Pytest topics. These topics are essential to understand in order to use *AlgoPytest* effectively.\n\n### AlgoPytest Setup\nFirstly, you must follow the Pytest directory structure. Essentially, all tests will be found within a `tests` directory in the root of your project.\n\nBefore being able to write Pytest tests for your Algorand Smart Contract, you will need to initialize some essential fixtures such as the smart contracts, signatures, and assets to be tested. Utility functions are provided by *AlgoPytest* which deploy these objects and return a reference to be used in a fixture. For a smart contract, this is most easily achieved by creating a `conftest.py` file and yielding the result of `algopytest.create_app` from within a fixture. It is critical to `yield` rather than `return` to not interfere with the *AlgoPytest* fixture clean up sequence.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\n# Sample project file structure\nsmart-contract-project/\n├── assets\n│   ├── approval_program.py\n│   ├── clear_program.py\n└── tests\n        ├── conftest.py\n        └── test_behavior.py\n```\n\n```python\n# File: conftest.py\nimport pytest\nfrom algopytest import create_app\n\n# Load the smart contracts from this project. The path to find these\n# imports can be set by the environment variable `$PYTHONPATH`.\n# e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=.../smart-contract-project/assets`\nfrom approval_program import approval_program\nfrom clear_program import clear_program\n\n# NOTE: It is critical to `yield` the `app_id` so that the clean up is properly performed.\n# The `owner` is an automatically available AlgoPytest defined fixture\n@pytest.fixture\ndef smart_contract_id(owner):\n    with create_app(\n            owner,\n            approval_program=diploma_program(), \n            clear_program=clear_program(),\n            local_bytes=1,\n            local_ints=1,\n            global_bytes=1,        \n    ) as app_id:\n        yield app_id\n```\n\nThe `approval_program` and `clear_program` must be Python functions which return a `pyteal.Expr`. \n\nFor example, the simplest clear program in this format is:\n```python\n# File: clear_program.py\ndef clear_program():\n    \"\"\"A clear program that always approves.\"\"\"\n    return Return(Int(1))\n```\n\n### Writing Pytest Tests\n\nThe *AlgoPytest* package is written as a Pytest plugin. This allows *AlgoPytest* to automatically register fixtures without you needing to import anything.  You may simply use the fixtures directly in the function signature.\n\nThese fixtures make testing Algorand Smart Contracts significantly easier for you as the developer. Fixtures such as the user ones: `owner`, `user1`, `user2`, etc. automatically create users with funded balances and cleans them up at the end of the test. Any smart contracts, signatures and assets yielded as fixtures are automatically deployed over the life of the test and then cleaned up. Without *AlgoPytest*, writing a test even as simple as checking whether the owner of an application can update their application requires non-negligible boilerplate code. Now, in order to write this test, all of the necessary boilerplate code is taken care of; you only have to focus only on the testing code at hand and nothing else.\n\n```python\n# File: test_behavior.py\ndef test_update_from_owner(owner, smart_contract_id):\n    \"\"\"The `owner` and `smart_contract_id` are AlgoPytest fixtures.\n    \n    This call will raise if there is any error.\"\"\"\n    update_app(owner, smart_contract_id)\n```\n\n### Pytest Documentation References\n- Pytest directory structure: [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules)\n- Pytest fixtures: [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html)\n- Pytest `conftest.py` : [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files)\n\n## Dev Installation\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/algopytest.git\ncd algopytest\nconda env create -f environment.yml\npre-commit install\npip install -e .\n```\n\nPlease submit a Pull Request for any suggested changes you would like to make.\n\n## Disclaimer\n**This package and smart contract(s) in this codebase have NOT been professionally audited.
