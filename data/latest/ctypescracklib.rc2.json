    "description": "Cracklib is great, and in newer packages there is a Python module available\r\nfor it. However, on systems that don't yet have it, such as CentOS 5, I've\r\nwritten a ctypes wrapper for the system cryptlib. This would also work on a\r\nsystem that you can't install python-libcrypt. It does require python with\r\nctypes available, so for CentOS 5 you have to install and use the python26\r\npackage.",
