It will show you the transit status of your deliveries or receptions,\nhelp you monitor your goods in transit and provide an easy way of dealing with the dates of\ndeparture and arrival.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure this module, you need to configure your Warehouse to use Transit Location\n\n * Go to *Warehouse/Configuration/Warehouse*\n * Edit your warehouse as follow:\n\n   * **Incoming Shipments**: *Receive goods directly in stock from Transit (transit + 1 step)*\n\n     and / or\n\n   * **Outgoing Shippings**: *Ship from stock to Transit location*\n\nYou now have a new menu under *Warehouse/Shipment* to deal with your shipment plan.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo create shipment plan, you need to:\n-------------------------------------\n\n * Go to Picking list in *Warehouse/Operations/All Operations*\n\n   or\n\n * Go to Move list in *Warehouse/Shipment/Waiting planification*\n\n * Select or Open some pickings/moves\n * Use **Add to a shipment** wizard\n\nThere, you will be able to create a new shipment or add selected moves to an existing shipment.\nOnly moves from the same source within same carrier can be bound together in a single shipment plan.\n\nConfirm and send a shipment:\n----------------------------\n\nOnce created the shipment plan must be confirmed. At that stage, you'll be able to load goods in\nthe consignment (by validating the departure pickings).\n\nWhen the carrier comes and takes the consigned goods, the person in charge must click on\n\"Send to transit\". There the system will:\n\n * If all departure pickings have been validated, mark the shipment plan as \"In transit\"\n * If not all departure pickings have been validated (e.g. all goods do not fit in the consignment),\n   the system will warn you and if you still send the shipment plan, it will exclude the remaining\n   goods so you can plan them in another shipment.\n\nReceive a shipment:\n-------------------\n\nUpon reception, you'll be asked to validate all arrival pickings. All related moves must be\nreceived to end the shipment plan workflow. In case not everything is here or you have damaged\ngoods, send them in a proper location (e.g lost in transit), so the shipment plan will be closed.\n\nMonitor you goods in transit:\n-----------------------------\n\n>From the menu *Warehouse/Shipment/In Transit* you can monitor what's in transit, what will arrive\nwhen, etc..\n\nOn every shipment plan you can update the following information using the relevant \"Update\"\nlink on the form:\n\n * To Address\n * Consignee\n * Carrier\n * Tracking Ref.\n * ETD and ETA\n\n This information will be updated on all related pickings and logged in the chatter.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n * Being able to print necessary document from a given shipment plan (airway bill, packing list, etc..)\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Yannick Vaucher <yannick.vaucher@camptocamp.com>\n* JoÃ«l Grand-Guillaume <joel.grandguillaume@camptocamp.com>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: http://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: http://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and promote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.\n\n\n\n",
