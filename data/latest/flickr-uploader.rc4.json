Check uploadr.ini config file.\n* Allows specific files to be ignored (via regular expressions)\n* Skips files that are over a configurable size (max flickr size is about 900MB)\n* Reuploads modified images as well as Videos (via delete/upload).\n* Automatically removes images from Flickr when they are removed from your\n  local hard drive\n* Optionally convert RAW files (with use of external tool: [exiftool by Phil Harvey](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)).\n\nTHIS SCRIPT IS PROVIDED WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.\nPLEASE REVIEW THE SOURCE CODE TO MAKE SURE IT WILL WORK FOR YOUR NEEDS.\nIF YOU FIND A BUG, PLEASE REPORT IT.\n\n### How it works! An example...\n#### Sample file structure\nConsider this example to explain how files are uploaded into Sets/Albums on Flickr.\n\nIf you have the following folders and pics  (the name of the flickr Sets/Albums depends on the uploadr.ini file setting FULL_SET_NAME, but I normally use it as False):\n```\n/home/user/media/pic00.jpg\n/home/user/media/Album1/pic01.jpg\n/home/user/media/Album2/pic02.jpg\n/home/user/media/Album3/pic03.jpg\n/home/user/media/folder/Album4/pic04.jpg\n/home/user/media/folder/Album4/Sub/pic041.jpg\n/home/user/media/newfolder/Album4/pic042.jpg\n/home/user/media/folderAlbum5/pic01.jpg\n/home/user/media/folderAlbum5/Sub/pic051.jpg\n```\n#### Setting your source folder with  FILES_DIR\nAnd you setup FILES_DIR\n```bash\nFILES_DIR=/home/user/media\n```\nYou should get the following depending on how the setting FULL_SET_NAME is set:\n\n| FilePathName | Set/Album Name (FULL_SET_NAME=False) | Set/Album Name (FULL_SET_NAME=True) | Pic | Remarks |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| /home/user/media/pic00.jpg | media | . | pic00 | |\n| /home/user/media/Album1/pic01.jpg | Album1 |  Album1 | pic01 | |\n| /home/user/media/Album2/pic02.jpg | Album2 |  Album2 | pic02 | |\n| /home/user/media/Album3/pic03.jpg | Album3 |  Album3 | pic03 | |\n| /home/user/media/folder/Album4/pic04.jpg | Album4 | folder/Album4 | pic04 | |\n| /home/user/media/folder/Album4/Sub/pic041.jpg | Sub  | folder/Album4/Sub  | pic041 | |\n| /home/user/media/newfolder/Album4/pic042.jpg | Album4 | newfolder/Album4 | pic042 | |\n| /home/user/media/Album5/pic01.jpg | Album5 |  Album5 | pic01 | Same pic as in Album01 is loaded twice as it's part of a different Album |\n| /home/user/media/Album5/Sub/pic051.jpg | Sub |  Album5/Sub | pic051 | With FULL_SET_NAME=False it will go into Album \"Sub\" |\n\n## Requirements\n---------------\n* Python 2.7+ (should work on DSM from Synology (v6.1), Windows and MAC)\n* Also compatile with Python 3.6 and 3.7\n* Recommendation on Synology DSM: **do not install/use** the \"Python Module\" from the DSM Packages.\n* flicrkapi module. May need to install get-pip.py. (Instructions for\n  Synology DSM below.)\n* portalocker module for Windows systems. Not mandatory for Synology.\n* File write access (for the token and local database)\n* Flickr API key (free)\n* exiftool, **only** if you intend to convert RAW files to JPG. [Install instructions here.](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/%7Ephil/exiftool/install.html). Note: You need to also install the DSM Package Perl.\n\n## Setup on Synology\n--------------------\n- Might work on other platforms like Windows also.\n- *Side note:* don't be overwhelmed with this setup. Steps are quite straitghtforward.\n- Summary steps:\n\n1. Enable SSH access to Synology DSM Server. (Optionally) install Python 3.\n2. Prepare a local folder location for Python modules install\n3. Download and install pip\n4. Download and install flickrapi\n5. Download and install flickr-uploader\n\n### 1.Enable SSH access to Synology DSM Server. (Optionally) install Python 3.\n- Enable and access your Synology DSM via SSH with an admin user.\n- Avoid the use of root for security reasons.\n- (Optionally) install via the Synology DSM Packages the \"Python 3\" package (corresponds to version 3.5)\n\n### 2. Prepare a local folder location for Python modules install.\n- **IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid messing up with the system files.**\n- Create a local install destination directory/folder define and export PYTHONPATH variable (ex: for Python 2.7):\n```bash\n$ cd\n$ mkdir apps\n$ mkdir apps/Python\n$ export PYTHONPATH=~/apps/Python/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n```\n- Or, for Python 3.5:\n``` bash\n$ export PYTHONPATH=~/apps/Python/lib/python3.5/site-packages\n```\n- Create also a `dev` directory/folder to use as working area where to download/extract the files/packages prior to intstallation:\n```bash\n$ cd\n$ mkdir dev\ndev$ cd dev\n```\n### 3. Download and install pip\n- **IMPORTANT NOTE: pip allows you to more easily install python related modules/applications.**\n- **Download** get-pip.py\n- **Extract to** ~/dev\n- And then **install** by running `python get-pip.py --prefix=~/apps/Python`\n- Follow [these guidelines for PIP installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).\n- **IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to use the --prefix parameter**\n```bash\n$ cd\n$ cd dev\ndev$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 1603k  100 1603k    0     0  3828k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3827k\ndev$ python get-pip.py --prefix=~/apps/Python\nCollecting pip\n    Downloading pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.3MB)\n        100%  1.3MB 495kB/s\nCollecting setuptools\n    Downloading setuptools-36.6.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (481kB)\n        100%  481kB 1.3MB/s\nCollecting wheel\n    Downloading wheel-0.30.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (49kB)\n        100%  51kB 4.1MB/s\nInstalling collected packages: pip, setuptools, wheel\n    Successfully installed pip setuptools wheel\n```\n### 4.

Having Task Scheduler replaces crontab.\n\n### On Linux/Unix/Mac based systems, run via crontab\n- Use  upload.cron added to the distribution and adapt to your needs.\n- Use either \"crontab -e\" or vi /etc/crontab according to your system.\n```bash\n# cron entry (runs at the top of every hour)\n0  *  *  *  * /full/path/to/uploadr.cron > /dev/null 2>&1\n```\n\n### Launch from the command line in Daemon mode (-d option).\n- Recommendation is to use Task Scheduler or cron.\n- With -d option it runs in daemon mode and checks for files every SLEEP_TIME seconds (as configured on uploadr.ini)\n- It simply loads the files. It does not create Albums/Sets.\n- SLEEP_TIME is only used in this case.\n```bash\n$ ./uploadr.py -v -d\n```\n\n## Recognition\n--------------\nInspired by:\n* https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/flickrapi\n* http://micampe.it/things/flickruploadr\n* https://github.com/joelmx/flickrUploadr\n\nMakes dynamic use of the following libraries:\n* https://github.com/jruere/multiprocessing-logging under **GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE**\n\n## Final remarks\n---------------\nYou may use this code however you see fit in any form whatsoever.\nAnd enjoy!!!\n\n## Questions & Answers\n----------------------\n* Q: Who is this script designed for?\n   - Those people comfortable with the command line that want to backup their media on Flickr in full resolution.\n\n* Q: Why don't you use OAuth?\n   - I do! As of November 2017\n\n* Q: Are you a python ninja?\n   - No, sorry. I just picked up the language to write this script because python can easily be installed on a Synology Diskstation.\n\n* Q: Is this script feature complete and fully tested?\n   - Nope. It's a work in progress. I've tested it as needed for my needs, but it's possible to build additional features by contributing to the script.\n   - Have a few starsand feedback that it is being used by several people.\n\n* Q: Do I need to install the \"Python Module\" from DSM Installation Package?\n   - No.\n   - The standard out-of-the-box python 2.7 installed with Synology (on versions up to DSM 6.2 a the time of writing this) is more than enough.\n   - In fact,in one particular report I received, this package was causing several conflicts so, please, don't install it.\n\n* Q: How to automate it with a Synology NAS ?\n   - First you will need to run script at least one time in a ssh client to get the token file.\n     Refer to the \"Task Scheduler (cron)\" section above.\n     Then with DSM 6.1, create an automate task, make it run once a day for example, and put this in the textbox without quotes \"path_to_your_python_program path_to_your_script\". For example, assuming you installed Python package from Synocommunity, command should look like \"/usr/local/python/bin/python /volume1/script/flickr-uploader/uploadr.py\".\n\n* Q: What if I have different folders to sync?\n   - the standard mode of operation should be to sync always the same main folder structure with all your subfolder/pics.\n   - syncing different folders on each run *does work* and uploads new pics; but uploadr was not originally designed for that.\n      - What happens to previously loaded pics depends if they still exist and Uploadr can still find them (depending if FILES_DIR was set as an absolute folder or relative folder path)\n         - File to upload: /home/user/media/2014/05/05/photo.jpg\n         - FULL_SET_NAME:\n            - False: 05\n            - True: 2014/05/05\n   - Uploadr saves the (full or relative depending on FILES_DIR) path name for the pics loaded. So, event though you provide a new origin folder, if the previously loaded pics still exist on their original locations, they are not deleted. If they are deleted from such original location or uploadr has no access to them, then they will be deleted from flickr.\n   - If using relative FILES_DIR and two files exist on the same subfolder, it will not be re-uploaded.\n   - So, in a nutshell, too many issues if you play around changing the FILES_DIR location.\n\n\n* Q: \"my understanding is that this is a sync script, which means when I later delete a pic from a synced folder, it will get deleted from Flickr\"\n   - Yes a file removed locally will be deleted from Flickr.\n   - *Remark*: I'm assuming in between each run you keep the contents of the flickrdb control database and do not remove it.\n\n* Q: \"What about previously existing folders (they didn't seem to get deleted)\"\n   - If all files from a folder (and corresponding Album on flickr) are deleted, then the actual Album will be also eliminated. Again, if you do not chnage the FILES_DIR in between runs.\n\n* Q: What about when I sync a folder with the same name of a previously existing folder? (you mention\ngetting existing sets from Flickr is managed also\n   - hmmm... if you mean \"sync a folder\" via setting FILES_DIR... it would depend if you use full or relative pathname on FILES_DIR. Check the section \"Clarification\" above. It will delete the files he cannot find locally.\n   - hmmm... if you mean two subfolders with the same name, to which Set/Album will be added depends on the setting FULL_SET_NAME. Check the section \"Clarification\" above for example pic042.\n\n* Q: What about when I run the script on ~/pictures/parent_folder/folder_A and then later on ~/pictures/parentfolder will the script recongize the folder_A within parentfolder as being the one it uploaded before becaues its content will have matching checksums?\n   - Again it depends on FULL_SET_NAME setting and FILE_DIR being an absolute or relative path and the match is initially done by full pathname + filename. So, in your example ~/pictures will expand to a full path so it would recognize the same files and not upload them again.\n\n* Q: I thought I read a mention of checksum as a way to detect file modification: what about the same file in 2 different folders, is it then upoad each time (in a set with the folder name) or only once?\n   - same file on two folders loads up twice. Check example above with Album5/pic02.jpg\n\n* Q: How to read the final report:\n   - Initial Found Files: Number of files found for processing.\n      - Bad Files:\n         - Files which failed to load previously due to Flickr error 5 (\"type not recognized\") or 8 (\"file to large\")\n         - Check explanation on \"-b\" and \"-c\" options.\n         - The remark \"some Bad files may no longer exist!\" indicates that previously recorded badfiles may already been deleted from the local filesystem. Check possible use of \"-c\" option.\n   - Photos count:\n      - Local: Number of local pics found.\n      - Flickr: Number of pics indicated by Flickr (may be off by 1 immediately after upload due to Flickr refres)\n      - Flickr-Local: Difference of Flickr to Local pics (for easier reading/tracking)\n      - Not in sets on Flickr: Indicates just that. It may indicate errors if it is bigger than 0, as all uploaded pics by uploadr should be on an Album. What I do normally, is to delete such pics from Flickr directly from the flickr/organize interface. But I've seen other users which have other tools uploading pics to Flickr to ignore this number.\n```\n  Initial Found Files:[   757]\n          - Bad Files:[     7] = [   750]\n          Note: some Bad files may no longer exist!\nPhotos count:\n                Local:[   750]\n               Flickr:[   755]\t[     5] Flickr-Local\nNot in sets on Flickr:[     0]\n```\n\n* Q: What happens if the local control Database (flickrdb) is deleted?\n  - By re-running the program **without the -u opiotn** it will go thru your local files and check/search for already loaded pics with same checksum+Set and re-builds the local database.\n\n* Q: Is all sensitive information (albums and filenames) masked with the **-u** option?\n  - Please note the **-u** masking option does not filter every sensitive information. In particular when DEBUG error level is set.\n\n",
