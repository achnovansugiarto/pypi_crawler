    "description": "Star Wars API ETL\n=================\n\nUsing the Star Wars API:\n\n1. Find the ten characters who appear in the most Star Wars films\n2. Sort those ten characters by height in descending order (i.e., tallest first)\n3. Produce a CSV with the following columns: name, species, height, appearances\n4. Send the CSV to httpbin.org\n5. Create automated tests that validate your code\n\n\nExecute the exercise\n--------------------\nAfter installing the app (instructions bellow), you can execute the full code and see the result with:\n\"`swapietl execute_exercise`\" command.\n\nIf you want to see\nthe full logs, execute it with `-v` : \"`swapietl execute_exercise -v`\"\n\nTo execute the tests (unit tests) you will need:\n\n- python 3.x\n- pip: `pip3` if your machine has `pip` for Python2.7 already installed.\n- tox: Can be installed through pip3\n\nTox has the next jobs defined:\n\n- `flake8`: Execute a flake8 code-check\n- `py{version}`: Where `version` is the python version, for example `py37`.\n\n*NOTE*: This solution does not provide integration tests for now.\n\n\nHow to install the app\n======================\nThe application is packaged using python setuptools. All the requirements are directly\ndefined inside the `setup.py` file except those needed for executing the tests (note\nthat the test files are not packaged within the application, so it doesn't make sense\nhaving the `test_require` definition on the setup file).\n\nInstall the application following one of these methods:\n\nNon development mode\n--------------------\n- Using pip without cloning the repository:\n   `pip install ./`\n\n- Using oficial remote pip server:\n   `pip install swapietl`\n\n- With python setuptools from source files:\n   `python setup.py install`\n\nDevelopment mode\n----------------\n- With pip using editable mode:\n   `pip install ./ -e`\n\n- With python setuptools using development mode:\n   `python setup.py develop`\n\n\nHow to run the app\n==================\nOnce you've installed the application, you can start executing commands from bash.\nThe application has one *console_script* created: `swapietl` if you want to enable debug logs execute it with `-v` flag (`swapietl -v`)\n\nThe application can be executed in two different modes explained bellow.\n\nRun the application in command line mode\n----------------------------------------\nUsing the \"`swapietl $command $arg1 $arg2`\" where `$command` is the function you want to execute and `$arg1` and `$arg2` the arguments.\n\nSo, for example, if you want to get the top ten characters that appeared in films, you can execute:\n`swapietl get_top_characters top=10`\n\nAnd, if you want to get them sorted and export the results to a csv you can:\n`swapietl get_top_characters top=10 and sort_by height and export_to_csv`\n\nNOTE: You can execute multiple commands by using the \"*and*\" special word.\n\nRun the application in REPL mode\n--------------------------------\nThe `swapietl` with no commands will bring you a REPL mode (interactive) where you can execute one by one\nthe possible commands with different parameters. It also brings you extra functionality as for example: autocomplete,\nsuggestions (in case of misspelled command).\n\nList of available commands\n==========================\nHere's the list of possible commands you can execute with `swapietl` (also listed with `swapietl help`):\n\n- `get_top_characters`: Retrieve the results from the exercise and save them into the app context.\n- `sort_by attribute='height' reverse=True`: Sort previous results by a given attribute.\n- `export_to_csv filename=\"~/results.csv\"`: Export the results from the app context into a file.\n  By default the filename is \"~/results.csv\".\n- `upload_file_to filename=\"~/results.csv\" url=\"http://httpbin.org/post\"`: Upload the file using requests library\n- `execute_exercise`: Execute the full exercise.",
