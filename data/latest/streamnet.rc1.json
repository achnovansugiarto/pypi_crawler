    "description": "# streamnet\nA directed netlist representation for stream processing\n\n## What is a streamnet object?\n\nA streamnet object (for lack of an existing term) is essentially a directed graph\ncomposed of a set of elements, a set of external input ports, a set of\nexternal output ports where:\n\n- Elements are nodes with labeled input and output pins. They can be zero, in which case\n  they become internal sources or sinks of information.\n- External input ports are nodes with an indegree of zero\n- External output ports are nodes with an outdegree of zero\n\nThese nodes are connected by directed edges with the following restriction:\n\n- Input pins in each element must have an indegree of one\n- There are no restrictions in the outdegree of output pins, including zero\n\nNote that every streamnet object is also an element.\n\n### What does this streamnet represent?\n\nStreamnets represent a subset of circuits and architectures where information flows between components in a directional, causal way. \n\n### What is the execution model of this network?\n\nThe execution model is essentially a flavor of dataflow programming:\n\nA streamnet object has a method `step` that puts new inputs into the input ports\nof the network. The `step` instruction\nis broadcasted to all elements in the network.\n\nEach element is either its own Streamnet object or an\narbitrary object with a similar interface. Elements can be stateful and/or have side effects outside the streamnet, such as logging.\n\nWhen a `step` instruction is broadcasted inside a streamnet, all elements pulls the existing input \nstates and carry out the computation. This is consistent with a synchronous\nexecution model, though elements can implement delays and queues. They can also pass information\nprobabilistically to incorporate asynchronous behavior.\n\n## Wait, is this a new type of object?\n\nThere are many dataflow or flow programming languages that probably implement similar abstractions.\nStreamnet is a variation on netlists in the sense that it is directed and input pins must have\nan indegree of one. It is also a generalization of flow networks.\n\nThe purpose here is to serve as a unifying model to tie in circuits, digital architectures, and \nspiking neural networks.\n\n## Streamnet implementaation\n\nThis repository contains a Python implementation of a Streamnet. Obviously the goal is to recreate\nthis model in a way that takes advantage of parallelism.\n\n## Team\n\nStreamnet is being developed by Angel Yanguas-Gil as part of Threadwork, a project\nfunded through DOE.\n\n\n",
