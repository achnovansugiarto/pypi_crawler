    "description": "# The VSP Dataset\n\n<!-- This repository contains scripts for inspection, preparation, and evaluation of the Cityscapes dataset. This large-scale dataset contains a diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of 5 000 frames in addition to a larger set of 20 000 weakly annotated frames.\n\nDetails and download are available at: www.cityscapes-dataset.net -->\n\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\nThe folder structure of the VSP dataset is as follows:\n```\n{root}/{split}/{date}/{profile}/{defect}/{layer}___{board}_{number}{type}{ext}\n```\n<!-- ```\n{root}/{type}{video}/{split}/{city}/{city}_{seq:0>6}_{frame:0>6}_{type}{ext}\n``` -->\n\nThe meaning of the individual elements is:\n\n - `root`  the root folder of the Cityscapes dataset. Many of our scripts check if an environment variable `VSP_DATASET` pointing to this folder exists and use this as the default choice.\n - `split` the split, i.e. train/val/test/train_extra/demoVideo. Note that not all kinds of data exist for all splits. Thus, do not be surprised to occasionally find empty folders.\n - `data` time of data collection. eg. AIVS_20xx_xx_xx.\n - `profile` ID of images generated by computer Aided Manufacturing.\n - `defect` positive and negative defects.\n - `layer` layer number of multi-layer PCB.\n - `board` ID of PCB images.\n - `number` number of defects.\n - `ext` the extension of the file and optionally a suffix, e.g. `_labelTrainIds.png` for ground truth files\n\n <!-- - `root`  the root folder of the Cityscapes dataset. Many of our scripts check if an environment variable `CITYSCAPES_DATASET` pointing to this folder exists and use this as the default choice.\n - `type`  the type/modality of data, e.g. `gtFine` for fine ground truth, or `leftImg8bit` for left 8-bit images.\n - `split` the split, i.e. train/val/test/train_extra/demoVideo. Note that not all kinds of data exist for all splits. Thus, do not be surprised to occasionally find empty folders.\n - `city`  the city in which this part of the dataset was recorded.\n - `seq`   the sequence number using 6 digits.\n - `frame` the frame number using 6 digits. Note that in some cities very few, albeit very long sequences were recorded, while in some cities many short sequences were recorded, of which only the 19th frame is annotated.\n - `ext`   the extension of the file and optionally a suffix, e.g. `_polygons.json` for ground truth files\n\nPossible values of `type`\n - `gtFine`       the fine annotations, 2975 training, 500 validation, and 1525 testing. This type of annotations is used for validation, testing, and optionally for training. Annotations are encoded using `json` files containing the individual polygons. Additionally, we provide `png` images, where pixel values encode labels. Please refer to `helpers/labels.py` and the scripts in `preparation` for details.\n - `gtCoarse`     the coarse annotations, available for all training and validation images and for another set of 19998 training images (`train_extra`). These annotations can be used for training, either together with gtFine or alone in a weakly supervised setup.\n - `gtBbox3d`     3D bounding box annotations of vehicles. Please refer to [Cityscapes 3D (Gählert et al., CVPRW '20)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07864) for details.\n - `gtBboxCityPersons` pedestrian bounding box annotations, available for all training and validation images. Please refer to `helpers/labels_cityPersons.py` as well as [CityPersons (Zhang et al., CVPR '17)](https://bitbucket.org/shanshanzhang/citypersons) for more details. The four values of a bounding box are (x, y, w, h), where (x, y) is its top-left corner and (w, h) its width and height.\n - `leftImg8bit`  the left images in 8-bit LDR format. These are the standard annotated images.\n - `leftImg8bit_blurred`  the left images in 8-bit LDR format with faces and license plates blurred. Please compute results on the original images but use the blurred ones for visualization. We thank [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/) for blurring the images.\n - `leftImg16bit` the left images in 16-bit HDR format. These images offer 16 bits per pixel of color depth and contain more information, especially in very dark or bright parts of the scene. Warning: The images are stored as 16-bit pngs, which is non-standard and not supported by all libraries.\n - `rightImg8bit`  the right stereo views in 8-bit LDR format.\n - `rightImg16bit` the right stereo views in 16-bit HDR format.\n - `timestamp`     the time of recording in ns. The first frame of each sequence always has a timestamp of 0.\n - `disparity`     precomputed disparity depth maps. To obtain the disparity values, compute for each pixel p with p > 0: d = ( float(p) - 1. ) / 256., while a value p = 0 is an invalid measurement. Warning: the images are stored as 16-bit pngs, which is non-standard and not supported by all libraries.\n - `camera`        internal and external camera calibration. For details, please refer to [csCalibration.pdf](docs/csCalibration.pdf)\n - `vehicle`       vehicle odometry, GPS coordinates, and outside temperature. For details, please refer to [csCalibration.pdf](docs/csCalibration.pdf) -->\n\nMore types might be added over time and also not all types are initially available. Please let us know if you need any other meta-data to run your approach.\n\nPossible values of `split`\n - `train`       usually used for training, contains 2975 images with fine and coarse annotations\n - `val`         should be used for validation of hyper-parameters, contains 500 image with fine and coarse annotations. Can also be used for training.\n <!-- - `test`        used for testing on our evaluation server. The annotations are not public, but we include annotations of ego-vehicle and rectification border for convenience.\n - `train_extra` can be optionally used for training, contains 19998 images with coarse annotations\n - `demoVideo`   video sequences that could be used for qualitative evaluation, no annotations are available for these videos -->\n\n\n## Scripts\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `vspscripts` with `setup.py`\n```\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py sdist\npip install . # or \"python setup.py install\" \n```\n\nInstall `vspscripts` in develop\n```\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py develop \n\n# uninstall in develop \npython setup.py develop --uninstall\n```\n\nInstall `vspscripts` with `pip`\n```\npython -m pip install vspscripts\n```\n\nGraphical tools (viewer and label tool) are based on Qt5 and can be installed via\n```\npython -m pip install vspscripts[gui]\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nThe installation installs the vspscripts scripts as a python module named `vspscripts` and exposes the following tools\n<!-- - `csDownload`: Download the cityscapes packages via command line.\n- `csViewer`: View the images and overlay the annotations.\n- `csLabelTool`: Tool that we used for labeling.\n- `csEvalPixelLevelSemanticLabeling`: Evaluate pixel-level semantic labeling results on the validation set.
