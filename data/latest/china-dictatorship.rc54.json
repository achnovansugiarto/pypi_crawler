This was the original goal.\n* serve as a censorship bomb to block <<github>> in China: <<keyword-attack>> to destroy the <<gfw>> and <<dictator-needs-gfw,therefore the CCP>>. Or more realistically get added to the <<github-gov-takedowns>> hall of fame.\n* be a fun and sometimes silly source of Chinese mostly anti-CCP culture like a better https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/China[Unencyclopedia] / https://web.archive.org/web/20191209021646/http://encyclopediadramatica.rs/China[Encyclopedia Dramatica] without the stupid stereotype jokes. Just quickly browse the pictures with Ctrl + F \"Figure\" and have fun.\n* serve as a place where people can post interesting related stuff in the issues: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues see also: <<shitpost>>\n* highlight positive about China's culture outside of its shitty government, such as <<the-best-chinese-supermarket-food-products,food>> and <<music>>. This has two goals:\n** teach foreigners (maybe even Chinese people on certain points) about amazing Chinese things that they can consume\n** show wumaos that <<ciro-santilli>> is not as clueless about China as they think\n\n== Copypasta\n\nHere's an image/sentence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copypasta[copypasta]/summary of key events for the <<keyword-attack>>.\n\nAnother advantage of this is that since it comes first in the repo, it ensures that key elements show up on github.com despite file size cutups: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610[].\n\nEach summary section contains a link to the main section, which contains sources and description of each image.\n\nText only:\n\n* <<xi-abolishes-term-limits-2018-03>> (2018包子露宪)\n* <<the-709-crackdown>>\n* <<panama-papers>> (邓家贵)\n* <<low-end-population>>\n* <<tibetan-unrest-2008>>\n\nText and image:\n\n**社会主义核心价值观 Core socialist values**\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Core_socialist_values.jpg[height=1000]\n\n**六四事件 Tiananmen square protests 1989**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#tiananmen\n\nMusic!\n\n* https://youtu.be/-JTWXqUPQ7I[Joan Baez - China]\n* https://youtu.be/6OOlXJs4I8k[Philip Morgan - Blood is on the square]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Tiananmen_students_sitting.jpg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Tank_Man.jpg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Tiananmen_crushed_dead.jpg[height=600]\n\n**法轮功 Falun Gong 1999 70M believer religion banned**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#falun-gong\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Falun_Gong_Guangzhou.jpg[height=600]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Falun_Gong_lady_silenced.jpg[height=600]\n\n**新疆改造中心 Xinjiang re-education camps 2018**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#xinjiang\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xinjiang_prisoners_sitting_identified.jpeg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xinjiang_prisoners_march.jpg[height=500]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Uyghur_sale_website.jpg[height=600]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xinjiang_camp_in_camp.jpg[height=600]\n\n**小熊维尼 Winnie the Pooh 2018**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#winnie-the-pooh\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xi_Pooh_Obama.webp[height=500]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xi_Abe_Pooh.webp[height=500]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Xi_Jinping_heart.jpeg[height=400]\n\n**郝海东 Hao Haidong Chinese soccer superstar turns against the CCP 2020**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#hao-haidong\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Hao_Haidong_kick.jpg[height=500]\n\n**冠状病毒审查 Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#corona\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Li_Wenliang_covid.jpg[height=400]\n\n**基督迫害 Christian persecution 2018**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#christianity\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Church_demolition.jpg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Last_Supper_Mao.jpg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Pope_CCP_deal.jpeg[height=400]\n\n**LGBT权利 The suppression of homosexuality**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#gay-rights\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Tiananmen_lesbian_kiss.jpg[height=500]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Addicted_bed.jpg[height=400]\n\n**996.ICU**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#nine-nine-six-icu\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/996ICU.png[height=400]\n\n**Gay Putin**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#gay-putin\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Gay_Putin.jpg[height=400]\n\n**The poisoning of Alexei Navalny 2020**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#the-poisoning-of-alexei-navalny-2020\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Navalny_hospital_sitting.jpg[height=400]\n\n**Vajiralongkorn Hamtaro**\n\nhttps://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship#thai-king-hamtaro\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Side_by_side_comparison_between_Thai_king_Vajiralongkorn_and_Hamtaro.jpg[height=400]\n\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Thai_king_crop_top.jpg[height=400]\n\n[[mirrors]]\n== Mirrors of this page (本网页的镜像)\n\nYou can download the webpage locally from GitHub at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/archive/gh-pages.zip\n\nMedia such as images are not stored in this repository, but rather at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media to keep the lightweight clone. That downloaded HTML will read images from that repository, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg[]. But we've learnt after creating that maybe the raw.githubusercontent.com subdomain is censored: <<github-censored-subdomains>>. If anyone can confirm, we will start using another image provider by default.\n\nClone locally with Git using GitHub images:\n\n....\ngit clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\ncd china-dictatorship\ngit checkout gh-pages\nxdg-open README.html\n....\n\nBuild it yourself:\n\n....\nbundle install\nmake\nxdg-open README.html\n....\n\nBuild with GitLab served images:\n\n....\ngit clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\ncd china-dictatorship\nmake MEDIA=MEDIA=https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master\n....\n\nBuild with local images:\n\n....\ngit clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\ngit clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media\ncd china-dictatorship\nmake MEDIA=../china-dictatorship-media\n....\n\nor build to use GitLab images:\n\nGiven <<github-censored-subdomains>>, this might be the only way to view the images from China.\n\nThe cool thing about Git is that we can maintain several mirrors on multiple websites very easily:\n\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship Canonical source and rendered output. If ever <<github-gov-takedowns>> we do this: <<strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns>>\n* https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\n** their gitlab.com render is shit for some reason, clicking on the ToC does not jump to headers properly, not sure why, IDs look correct\n** one really cool thing about gitlab is that it can serve images from directly gitlab.com e.g. https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg unlike GitHub which has the `raw.` subdomain: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg This makes it impossible to block the GitLab images without blocking all of gitlab.com, until GitLab starts a <<github-gov-takedowns,gov-takedowns>> of their own.\n** https://cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship GitLab Pages. Works fine. Let's see if they can block subdomains: https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship\n** Maybe some day https://gitlab.cn/ ? :-) Edit 2021-03, yup, it happened, with <<icp-license>> and all\n*** https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/18/gitlab-licensed-technology-to-new-independent-chinese-company/\n*** https://about.gitlab.cn/\n*** <<ciro-santilli>>'s name at: https://about.gitlab.cn/security/vulnerability-acknowledgements/\n*** no free public SaaS yet, but it might come, though they are saying 30 day trial only: https://about.gitlab.cn/free-trial/\n* https://gitee.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship on <<gitee>>, blocked after 12 hours: <<gitee-censorship>>\n* https://bitbucket.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\n* https://git.kiwifarms.net/CrunkLord420/china-dictatorship auto-pull Gitea mirror on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms[Kiwi Farms] (a <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>> social network website)\n* https://gitlab.binets.fr/ciro.duran-santilli/china-dictatorship\n\nGitHub Pages: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship trade-offs with https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[]:\n\n* pros\n** cut up to 512KB of source, and therefor unacceptable as the only source: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610[]\n** https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-anonymized-image-urls[GitHub's camo] keeps hiccuping and not showing images\n** and YouTube videos show inline there\n* cons\n** domain will eventually get blocked in China. <<greatfire>> https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.com shows that in 2020-01-19 the domain was unblocked, but on the next text at 2020-05-23 it was \"contractictory\".\n** Camo bypasses the need for VPN, since most images are served from <<wayback-machine>> which is <<censorship,blocked in China>>.\n\nIt is really interesting to see how many people star the GitHub repository, and then a few minutes later they think about how they might get put in jail, and then unstar it. Talk about <<chilling-effect>>! But yes, for the love of God, please stay safe: <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship>>.\n\nGitHub Pages was first enabled in 2020-03-22 at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/commit/0b362a83fb5dd55f67b9d351551d0c18e7f3229a[].\n\nThe perfect solution might be to download all images and upload them to https://github.com/cirosantilli/media since GitHub content does not go through Camo, we have to see if such images don't fail to load as often.\n\nA few NPM/Git CDNs can also be used to bypass subdomain blocks, and some actually render HTML with the correct content type.

After https://askubuntu.com/questions/594656/how-to-install-the-latest-versions-of-nodejs-and-npm/971612#971612[installing NPM], you can be use it as:\n\n....\nnpm i -g china-dictatorship\nchina-dictatorship > README.html\n....\n\nThis forces China to also block/curate package managers to block this repo. The package is already available in the following NPM Chinese mirrors, both which were blocked at some point:\n\n* Taobao: https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200406081433/http://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship[archive]).\n+\nNoticed down as of 2021-02-23, replaced by a dummy package admined by fengmk2@gmail.com presumably https://github.com/fengmk2 and https://fengmk2.com/ and https://twitter.com/fengmk2 He is a large NPM contributor, and likely `cnpm` too. TODO is he pro or against <<censorship>> based on online comments?\n+\nIn order to overcome this, includers\n* Aliyun from <<alibaba>>: https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20210211123658/https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship[archive]).\n+\nTaken down as 404 likely around 2021-02-22 after come incoming links from https://developer.aliyun.com[] to https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship?spm=a2c6h.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4vwIZTP[] and `?spm=.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4PsRmA`.\n\nThere is actually a `cnpm` tool to install from Chinese mirrors: https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm[].\n\nWe also managed to upload a Python PyPi package at: https://pypi.org/project/china-dictatorship/ Is as:\n\n....\npython3 -m pip install --user --upgrade china-dictatorship\nchina-dictatorship.py > README.html\n....\n\nLike NPM, this will also have Chinese mirrors that will need to be censored by their admins ovrview https://titanwolf.org/Network/Articles/Article?AID=25a20c20-c97b-4bfe-af67-760861343658 :\n\n* http://pypi.douban.com/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://pypi.douban.com/simple/numpy both up March 2021\n* http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/numpy both down March 2021 but in a different way, so maybe it was censored already\n* http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/numpy both down March 2021\n* http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/numpy both down March 2021\n* https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/numpy both up March 2021\n* reference: https://pypi.org/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs https://pypi.org/simple/numpy/\n\nWe later found on Google by chance that libraries.io picked it up and rendered the README.adoc nicely as well: https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200318043050/https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship[archive]). This is why packaging is a good idea.\n\nA programmatic interface is also exposed on those packages, making it easy to quickly add a `--china` option to your project, e.g. from Python:\n\n....\nimport china_dictatorship\nassert \"Tiananmen Square protests\" in china_dictatorship.get_data()\n\nprint(china_dictatorship.get_data())\n....\n\nor from Node.js:\n\n....\nconst china_dictatorship = require('china-dictatorship');\nif (!china_dictatorship.get_data().includes(\"Tiannmen Square protests\")) throw 0;\n\nconsole.log(china_dictatorship.get_data());\n....\n\nYou have to do the assert after the imports because otherwise Chinese mirrors could replace the real package with dummy packages to not break imports, as was already done once at https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship[].\n\nThis outputs the rendered HTML, which end users should the pipe into a file:\n\n....\n./your-program --china > README.html\nxdg-open README.html\n....\n\nConcrete examples:\n\n* https://cirosantilli.com/cirodown/china\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/commit/082166a360c56990662c715196229016d8806ab3\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/vcdvcd#vcdcat-china[]. Sample Chinese fork removing the most important functionality: https://github.com/ZihaoZhao/vcdvcd\n\nThese also offer great plausible deniability: a citizen in China could always argue that they were just interested in the software itself, and had no choice but to download it.\n\nTODO: create an Ubuntu PPA and Ruby gem as well.\n\nAnother source of China-specific mirroring are GitHub proxies, https://linuxpip.org/github-in-china/ contains an overview:\n\n* https://hub.fastgit.org/ this appears to auto-redirect to GitHub from non-Chinese IPs, but presumably shows the pages for Chinese IPs, e.g. we had hits from http://hub.fastgit.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[] in 2021-03-25. This happened soon after SEO optimizations mentioned at: <<zhao-heming>> and might be related.\n* https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/ as of March 2021, it often reaches an apparently random \"Whoa there! You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism.\". But other time it succeeds, e.g. some of the times: https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship is visible.\n* https://a1.mk-proxy.ml/-----https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship generated from http://toolwa.com/github/\n* https://github.com/521xueweihan/GitHub520\n* https://github.independentlyreview.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship described at https://independentlyreview.com/link as using https://workers.cloudflare.com/[Cloudflare workers]\n* https://github-dotcom.gateway.web.tr/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship a Turkish proxy. They have their own censorship issues as well of course.\n\nCreate tags,and update all mirrors in one go with: link:push-mirrors[]:\n\n....\nsudo apt install python3-setuptools\npython3 -m pip install --user setuptools wheel twine\n./push-mirrors\n....\n\nIn particular, that script calls link:push[]:\n\n....\n./push\n....\n\nwhich is more lightweight and pushes just to GitHub and GitLab Pages, so we are going to be using that more often to avoid overloading package managers too much.\n\n`./push` is used to publish every commit.\n\nThere is no need to update package versions or add git tags, all of that gets done automatically by the script!\n\n[[github-repositories-with-censored-information]]\n== GitHub repositories with censored information (政治敏感的GitHub库)\n\nFor lists of censored information outside of GitHub see: <<lists-of-material-censored-in-china>>.\n\nFor content outside of GitHub: <<lists-of-material-censored-in-china>>.\n\nMentioned in other sections:\n\n* <<gov-takedowns-china>>\n* <<nine-nine-six-icu>>\n* <<nCovMemory>>\n* <<bandinchina-github-repository>>\n* https://github.com/jasonqng/chinese-keywords mentioned at <<where-can-i-find-good-words-for-a-keyword-attack>>\n* https://github.com/programthink/zhao from <<programthink>>\n* <<censorship-monitoring-tools-on-github>>\n* <<huawei>>:\n** https://github.com/evil-huawei/evil-huawei\n** https://github.com/HuaweiJoke/Huawei-Joke\n* https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo from <<fuck-xuexiqiangguo>>\n* from <<metoo>>\n** https://github.com/sikaozhe1997/Xin-Yue/blob/master/letter.md\n** https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man\n* https://github.com/fuckcqcs/fuckcqcs at <<changsheng-bio-technology-vaccine-data-falsification-incident-2018>>\n* <<xi-jinping-speech-synthesizer>>\n\nNot mentioned in other sections:\n\n* taibangle (太棒了)\n** https://github.com/taibangle/awesome-china\n** https://github.com/taibangle/lennon-wall\n* https://github.com/Project-Gutenberg/Pincong see also <<pincong>>\n* https://speechfree.github.io/cultural-revolution-database/ 中国文化大革命文库 The Chinese Cultural Revolution Database\n* https://github.com/Luterngun/Record_of_Survival_in_Digital_Totalitarian_Era[] small docuement that goes over <<censorship-circumvention>> and opsec.

Ciro was jealous, and added some anti-wumao comments in. On commits:\n\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/commit/0cc2b2a546ad51fb360ba800c67b057ea3270869#commitcomment-47495235\n* https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/commit/42de05338193f39981b1a820873a990c959fd6ec#commitcomment-47392119\n\nhttps://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/416#issuecomment-784939665 \"为什么这个屎一样的东西会出现在我个人主页左侧的repositories中，那里不是应该只有自己的项目才会出现吗？有办法屏蔽它吗？还是github故意的？\" explains why so many people come comment in the repository: it is because it appears on the \"Explore repositories\" repository suggestions which show on the side bar of your GitHub homepage, and on searches. This was also mentioned at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201 originally titled \" 一搜索中文就跑出这屌鬼玩意，爱玩政治去竞选总统啊，笨，死扑街\". Ciro feels that that Chinese people might use GitHub search much more than Western people because their search engines are shit due to <<censorship>>, <<censorship-makes-countries-poorer>> comes vibrantly to mind.\n\nAfter further inspection, taught understood that repository descriptions given to GitHub can be really huge for SEO: they had pasted the entire 21st century text there.\n\nSo Ciro attempted the same approach, and pasted all of link:21century.md[], link:wang-huning-three-dynasties.adoc[] and link:fifth-modernization.md[] in there on 2021-03-23, and the effect was dramatic: an immediate 4x more views on the following day according to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/graphs/traffic[] (40 unique visitors to 100 on a Wednesday), and a few wumao comments. And a wumao soon confirmed that it was working directly: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201[].\n\nCiro believes that this is due to two reasons:\n\n* there aren't so many good Chinese repositories to compete with\n* perhaps more importantly, Chinese language does not have spaces, which makes implementing search for it more difficult, because if you hit all the characters, even if they are not part of the search words, it also gets counted as a hit\n\nThis can be automated with: link:description.sh[].\n\nFurther optimizations using link:description[]:\n\n....\ngit clone https://github.com/kon9chunkit/GitHub-Chinese-Top-Charts\n./description\n....\n\nthis does some processing to increase density creates a BOMB:\n\nCiro started using that one instead to see if it was going to be more effective on 2021-03-28. First it hit a peak of 168 visitors on Monday 2021-03-29, and then fell back to 90 and 81 on the following days, so similar to the previous Chinese political input. It is very hard to understand why the first day was so different.\n\nIt also includes:\n\n* https://github.com/trending?since=monthly&spoken_language_code=zh trending Chinese repositories\n+\nA large part of those projects falls in the following categories:\n+\n** interview preparation. Competition is of course cutthroat with such a large population.\n** collections of interesting things Chinese like repositories or blog posts\n\nFurthermore, Ciro later noticed that under GitHub's settings, there is a \"Preferred spoken language\" box described as \"We'll use this language preference to filter the trending repository lists on Explore and our Trending Repositories page.\" Therefore, the secret to get lots of hits is to add Chinese programming keywords to the repository description string.\n\nNew issues:\n\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/533 \"Thank you for this great repository. Human rights and freedom of speech are more important than money. github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship\"\n* https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/issues/138 \"Why put the censored content in the .gitignore?\"\n\nOn top commented/liked issues:\n\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/190#issuecomment-784921038\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/224#issuecomment-784901942\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/319#issuecomment-784903480\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/325#issuecomment-784922882 \"看你发的“美中”而不是“中美”我就知道你TM是轮子\" claims they are <<falun-gong>>\n* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/346#issuecomment-784936138 \"那么问题来了,为什么美国及西方和越南共产党亲近呢?\" the US allies with Vietnam Communists for geopolitical reasons only, not because it has any ideology\n\nThe first is \"21世纪新政宣言\" (New System Declaration for the 21st Century).\n\nIt proposes a peaceful reunification of China with <<taiwan>> under their specified political system described in 12 paragraphs. This system is a reformed type of Western democracy, which the manifesto also criticize downsides of.\n\nThe manifesto is dated drafted 2019.8.6, and several versions have different update dates and revision numbers, e.g. our copy is dated 7th edition of 2020.6.19. TODO what is canonical?\n\nThe manifesto provides an email \"wanghunn@gmx.com\" for those who signed it to send the signed version to, and describes the author as male 70 years old Chinese person.\n\nTODO what does: \"起草人：赫连禾\" mean?\n\nThe second is \"三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁\" (The Culprit of Three Dynasties Wang Huning).\n\nThe title presumably refers to:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Huning\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/王沪宁\n\nWikipedia mentions:\n\n____\nWang is believed to have been one of the principal architects behind the official political ideologies of three paramount leaders: \"Three Represents\" by Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Development Concept by Hu Jintao, and the <<chinese-dream,Chinese Dream>> and <<xi-jinping-thought>> of Xi Jinping.\n____\n\nso it must be about him.\n\nThe manifesto is divided into 23 numbered headers which appear to be independently published texts later collected. It is signed by 郝雪森 (Hao Xuesen) 2016-09-10. One of the sections gives the email: haoxuesen@gmx.com[].\n\n=== Bot + issue mention attack\n\nIn March 2021, this repo had a traffic search spike for: \"Search · 联级选择器\"\n\nThis term refers to https://ant.design/components/cascader-cn/ which seems to be a CSS live selector\n\nThe related project: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro\n\nSomeone actually used wumao techniques mentioned at:\n\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/191\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/192\n\nto attack that repo:\n\n* https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro/issues/8133 https://archive.ph/xp8ls\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/196 https://archive.ph/etYSf\n\nTODO which exact GitHub action did they rely on?

Asked at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/203\n\n[[faq]]\n== FAQ (常见问答集)\n\n[[why-keyword-attack]]\n=== Why attack websites with censored keywords? 用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？\n\nThe attack: <<keyword-attack>>.\n\nTo <<effective,destroy the firewall>>.\n\nThis would then end <<censorship>>.\n\nAnd then <<dictator-needs-gfw,Ciro believes>> that this would also <<why-end-dictatorship,end the dictatorship>>.\n\nThe keyword attacks increase the cost of censorship.\n\nIf commies censor things, they will get worse IT technology, and thus become <<richer,less rich>> and militarily powerful.\n\nSince all they care about, like any other politicians, is power, the only way to make them stop censorship is to make the cost of censorship higher than not censoring.\n\nWithout the threat that China will be less technologically, and therefore militarily advanced, there is no incentive for the CCP to destroy the firewall.\n\nThe goal is to put them in a position where they have to choose between either:\n\n* having military power\n* remaining a <<dictatorship,dictatorship>>\n\nbut not both, since having both means that they will <<war,start WW3 and destroy humanity>>.\n\nAnd if they decide to destroy the dictatorship, Ciro wants to help China become <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,the most awesome country on Earth>>.\n\nClosely related/identical ideas are <<cute-cat-theory-of-digital-activism>> and <<collateral-freedom>>.\n\nRelated attack: <<photobombing-like-attacks>>.\n\n[[harm-programmers]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli want to harm the Chinese programmers? 三西猴想要伤害中国程序员吗？\n\nNo.\n\nThis is not a <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,revenge>> of any kind.\n\nCiro knows that he is harming you in the short term, and he doesn't like that.\n\nBut he believes that this harm is a necessary means to reach his real goal, which is to destroy the <<gfw,firewall>>, and the <<dictatorship,dictatorship>>.\n\nDon't you think it is worth a try? Destroying the firewall, would <<why-end-dictatorship,enormously benefit>> not only Chinese programmers, but every single other Chinese person too.\n\nOnce the firewall is destroyed, which <<dictator-needs-gfw,may destroy the dictatorship>>, he want China to develop the best science and technology in the world, and <<would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china>>.\n\nAnd by the way, with his https://github.com/cirosantilli[extensive contributions to open source software], Ciro is already helping China, and all underdeveloped countries, to become stronger. His hope is that if poor countries become richer and better educated, that they will be less likely to be influenced by the CCP's money, and therefore are more likely to be allies of democracy.\n\nSee also: <<disturbs>>.\n\n[[harm-people]]\n===== Does Ciro Santilli want to make the Chinese people people look bad?\n\nNo, the opposite.\n\nCiro only wants their <<dictatorship,dictatorial government>> to look bad to destroy it, and help China become <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,the most awesome country on Earth>>.\n\nEven the Chinese that are against their own Government <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship,cannot do much about it openly>>, so it is not their fault.\n\nAnd even those <<i-like-my-dictatorship,who supported their dictatorship>> must be respected, whoever <<stupid,stupid>> and <<brainwashed-by-usa,brainwashed>> you might think they are, <<democracy-is-a-religion,since it is impossible to prove who is right or wrong in politics>>.\n\nSee also: <<about>>.\n\n[[stupid]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli think that the Chinese are stupid or brainwashed? 三西猴觉得中国人是啥子或被洗脑吗？\n\nObviously not, if you even thought about this, it is likely because of: <<evil-west>>.\n\nDon't you see that this is just pure and simple politics? And likely ineffective one at that: <<effective>>.\n\n* everyone is brainwashed by their environment: <<brainwashed-by-usa,brainwashed>>\n* it is impossible to prove who is right or wrong in politics: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>\n* not even the CCP is evil: <<ccp-evil>>\n\nRelated:\n\n* <<young-pioneers-of-china>>\n* <<little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream,Little pink explains the difference between the American dream  and the Chinese dream>>\n\n[[keyword-attack]]\n==== Screen name keyword attack\n\nA keyword consists of adding censored words to your username: https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245\n\nThis only works on websites that show usernames everywhere.\n\nThis then leads to your username appearing on thousands of pages, depending on how much you contribute to the website.\n\nIt is also possible to do it with images, although this is less effective in taking down websites since images are harder for the firewall to track automatically. But:\n\n* they are more memorable than words\n* they also work on websites like GitHub where your real name does not show on most pages, only slug\n\nso maybe the most effective approach is to use both keywords and images to get the best of both worlds ;-)\n\nThis type of attack is essentially an <<embargo>>, and it is especially effective in websites that contain valuable technical content, such as <<stack-overflow>> and <<github>>.\n\nSee also: <<photobombing-like-attacks>>.\n\nSome people say https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/284671/dont-st-where-you-eat[don't shift where you eat].

If [authorities] truly want to block access to this information, then they must give up certain access to economic freedoms.\n____\n\n2015 coverage: https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/30/greatfire/\n\nThere's an useless Wiki page for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_freedom\n\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2019/05/10/amazon_backtracks_on_s3/ clarifies that on Amazon S3 the question is about:\n\n* `https://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket_name>/<object_key_name>`\n* `https://<bucket_name>.s3.amazonaws.com/<object_key_name>`\n\nthe second of which can be easily blocked by domain, but the first can't, and how amazon was planning on killing the first option.\n\n[[dual-use-technology]]\n===== Dual-use technology (军民两用技术)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology\n\nNormally, the term \"dual-use technology\" is used in the context of blocking exports that can be used either for peace, but also for war.\n\nHowever, as mentioned https://twitter.com/Dogbert_Catbert/status/1372467670826684419[by a Twitter friend], a <<keyword-attack>> for Freedom of Speech is also essentially a dual-use matter.\n\n* <<western-companies-that-sell-censorship-technology-to-dictatorships>>\n\n[[meant-to-be-used]]\n=== Politics should not be posted in technical websites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow 不应该在技术网站例如Stack Overflow和GitHub讨论政治\n\nSo, where do you propose politics be posted? On Facebook or Twitter, which are already blocked by the <<gfw>>? Or maybe on <<weibo>>, where it will be taken down within seconds due to <<internal-censorship,internal censorship>>?\n\nIs the Chinese government using the Internet the way it was meant to be used, by investing billions in <<censorship>>?\n\nWhat about <<nine-nine-six-icu>>? Did you also complain about it, or did you just star it like 250k of your fellow programmers?\n\nAny act of protest will use things in ways that it was not meant to be used.\n\nFor example, the street is not meant to showcase protest banners, it is meant to be a passageway for cars.\n\nAs engineers, we have a moral responsibility towards society. We should not blindly follow orders of those in power if it violates our principles, e.g. build weapons or censorship mechanisms. And we should freely express our principles and violation concerns.\n\nMaking a statement where no one will ever see it, like a personal website, is <<effective,sure to have no effect>>.\n\nMuch of the best art and technology is about using something in a way that it wasn't meant to be used.\n\nFinally, the political powers of each website decide what is allowed or not on their website, and what is not allowed gets blocked. So far, Stack Overflow and GitHub's Terms of Service have said to go ahead:\n\n* <<stack-overflow>>\n* <<github>>\n\nAnother consideration is that any profile information is essentially a form of advertisement. Some people advertise their skills for hire, or their company and product. Other people, advertise their <<falun-gong,religion>> or <<gay-rights,sexual orientation>>. So why should you not be able to advertise your political position? Companies pay millions of dollars to grab other people's attention.

Much more likely to have any effect, would be for <<ciro-santilli>> to become rich and powerful first, and the best way to do that is to invest in whatever he thinks is most useful.\n\nActually, it can even be argued that Ciro's somewhat irrational, since he would be much more likely to become rich and powerful by bowing down to the CCP and trying to get their money instead.\n\nOn the other hand, becoming rich and powerful is also highly unlikely, so maybe it's justa matter of taking a low-risk low-reward path?\n\nCiro has have very little free time, and he will never do something for political reasons, only things that interest me technically.\n\nFinally, do you really think he'd be able to do such awesome projects if he had primarily political considerations in mind?

Any criticism of the government, even if constructive, <<censorship,is taken as menace to power, and more likely to be shut down>>, which makes the government and just becomes less efficient since there is less feedback.\n+\nThis greatly increase the probability of dealing poorly with such problems, see e.g. all the global problems listed at: <<not-chinese>>.\n* governments are monopolies, and the more powerful they are, the worst it is for competition an efficiency in general. E.g.: the startup with better government ties wins, instead of the most efficient one.\n* people in dictatorships tend to <<real-username-law,hide their true identities online>> and in life in general. It is best not to stand out, because if you make any mistake, you are really fucked. As a result, for example, if you do something awesome like a creating an open source project, but do it anonymously, you won't get as much fame. And therefore everyone does less of such awesome things on average.\n\nAgainst:\n\n* presidents only care about the 4-8 year horizon, while dictators can make longer term decisions to maintain power forever, their power being limited only by \"the people are happy enough to not start a revolution\"\n* dictatorships can make changes faster without the same amount of discussion that happens in democracies, where power is more spread out.\n+\nKilling a million people will make us richer? No problem, let's do it.\n+\nThat is great when they make good decisions, but it sucks when they make <<war,bad ones>> more likely.\n\nMaybe China was poor because of Mao's crazy communist regime. Similar regimes also made <<russia>> poor. And yes, before that exploitation by the West may have been a factor.\n\nDefinitely, the current regime is better than Mao's, but just imagine how rich China could be if it had more freedom and justice.\n\nImperial China lost the race for the Industrial Revolution.

China has had remarkable growth since the 1980s, but the prolonged devastation and hardship produced by China's \"<<great-leap-forward>>\" (when millions of farmers starved to death) and its Cultural Revolution would unlikely have occurred in a democratic country like say India. Nor is it likely that say Cuba and many African nations would have suffered so long with such terrible economic policies if they had reasonably democratic institutions.\n____\n\n[[tea-egg-incident]]\n===== Tea egg incident (茶葉蛋事件, 2011)\n\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶葉蛋事件\n\nA Taiwanese celebrity said many people in China can't even buy <<tea-egg,tea eggs>>, which are extremely cheap and easy to make at home: you just need to cook some eggs in any cheap tea!

It was a way to exploit the corruption to our advantage.\" At the time, \"promotion fees\" sometimes ran into the millions of dollars, according to a former senior CIA official: \"It was quite amazing the level of corruption that was going on.\" The compensation sometimes included paying tuition and board for children studying at expensive foreign universities, according to another CIA officer.\n____\n\nWell known corruption cases:\n\n* 2020 Ren Zhiqiang\n** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_Zhiqiang\n** https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/任志强\n** https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/22/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang-xi-jinping-intl-hnk/index.html \"Chinese tycoon who criticized <<xi-jinping,Xi Jinping>>'s handling of <<covid,coronavirus>> jailed for 18 years\"\n* 2012 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ling_Jihua[Ling Jihua] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/令计划[令计划]): son died in Ferrari crash with two women on the car, which put the spotlight on him\n* 2012 <<bo-xilai>>: trigerred by the murder of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Heywood[Neil Heywood], of which Bo's wife was accused\n\nRelated events:\n\n* <<panama-papers>>\n\n===== Operation Fox Hunt\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fox_Hunt\n\nTrying to prevent corruption is fine, but violating the laws of other countries in doing so, or the <<rule-of-law>> of their family is not.\n\nPublicized by China itself: <<china-daily>> http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-11/05/content_22375920.htm\n\n* 2020-10-28 \"Eight Individuals Charged With Conspiring to Act as Illegal Agents of the People's Republic of China\" https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/eight-individuals-charged-conspiring-act-illegal-agents-people-s-republic-china\n\n[[liu-changming]]\n====== The detention of Liu Changming's (刘昌明) family (2018)\n\nChina imposed an exit ban on the ex-official's family, who are also USA citizens:\n\n* officer Liu Changming (刘昌明)\n* wife Sandra Han\n* children Victor Liu (born July 1999 in the USA) and Cynthia Liu (27 in 2019, born in China, but also American citizen)\n\nChina says that the children and wife do have valid Chinese documents, so maybe those idiots did not give up their Chinese citizenship and went to China.

Under <<xi-jinping>>, it may be argued that it did not, and maybe that we should just stop feeding them technology and accept that they won't become free.\n\nTrump's link:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/trump-banning-huawei-beginning-of-biggest-trade-war-ever-united-states[2019 China trade war], and in particular the <<huawei>> ban, is an event that has brought this question to the spotlight once again.\n\n===== Keyword attacks could be used by certain CCP political groups to justify blocking off the entire external Internet, and make the dictatorship even more pervasive\n\nIt is a risk, but it would make China drastically <<richer,less powerful>>, so at least they wouldn't be able to start or sustain <<war,WW3>>. So I don't think it will go that way.\n\n[[so-block-cost]]\n==== Stack Overflow and GitHub could be blocked at no cost by the Chinese government\n\nHitting the block button has, of course, no cost.\n\nThe cost of blocking Stack Overflow lies of course in the loss of information, and slower technological development, see also: <<why-keyword-attack>>\n\nRemember that it is not possible for the Chinese government to block only certain pages of HTTPS websites due to encryption: either the entire IP/domain name is blocked, or nothing.\n\nThe 2019 <<nine-nine-six-icu>> event however brought to my attention that Chinese (usually WebKit-based) browsers are already censoring HTTPS websites selectively of course, see e.g.: https://github.com/996browser/996.BROWSER/tree/77f28a36a862e3cc4d238dc47c19872156096bc4\n\nBut Ciro doubt developers use those browsers, right?

Before the war, the peasantry was not ready for revolution; economic reasons were not enough to mobilize them. More important was nationalism: \"It was the war that brought the Chinese peasantry and China to revolution; at the very least, it considerably accelerated the rise of the CCP to power.\"\n____\n+\nAnd China would be much much less technologically advanced had it come in contact with the West, from which it is still trying to learn/steal from: <<university-espionage>>.\n+\nForeign influence can be both good or bad.\n* http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2005/07/12/2003263221/ (BIASED) says:\n+\n____\nWar histories from both Japan and the Republic of China clearly indicate the scale of the CCP's \"participation.\" From 1937 to 1945, there were 23 battles where both sides employed at least a regiment each. The CCP was not a main force in any of these. The only time it participated, it sent a mere 1,000 to 1,500 men, and then only as a security detachment on one of the flanks.\n\nThere were 1,117 significant engagements on a scale smaller than a regular battle, but the CCP fought in only one. Of the approximately 40,000 skirmishes, just 200 were fought by the CCP, or 0.5 percent.\n\nNot even the CCP can provide any data on its number of casualties in the war, and there are no memorials to CCP heroes in the war to be found in China. This makes one wonder what China really did contribute\n____\n\n[[brainwashed-by-usa]]\n==== Non-Chinese people have been brainwashed by the USA know nothing about China\n\nEveryone is \"brainwashed\" by their environment.\n\nE.g. people in the West are brainwashed to believe in democracy, freedom of speech and human rights.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> doesn't doubt that Chinese people know more about China than him.\n\nSaying that \"someone is not Chinese, he does not understand China\", is just an useless https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem[ad hominem] argument and closely related to <<not-chinese>>.\n\nSince you know so much about China, why  why don't you just actually prove your point by teaching Ciro one single interesting about China that Ciro didn't know about? He loves learning new things.\n\nBut please, link to reference material instead of just saying it, it will be much more convincing.\n\nBut if you are Chinese, also consider that you have been brainwashed by the commies, so likely much more than Ciro since you live in a dictatorship.\n\nSee also: <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.\n\n[[evil-west]]\n==== The commies exaggerate the threat of the West to keep in power\n\nFirst, obviously, <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.\n\nHowever, the CCP greatly exaggerates how evil the West is, because making your people constantly afraid is a classic strategy used by dictators to stay in power.\n\nOr in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable[fable] form:\n\n____\nOnce upon a time, there was a farmer with a farm.\n\nOne day, the animals on the farm started feeling a bit trapped, and started bumping against the fence to get out.\n\nThe farmer, however, was smart, and told the animals:\n\n_____\nCareful! There is a wolf outside! If you go out, you will be eaten by the wolf!\n_____\n\nThe animals, were not that smart, and listened to the farmer, they were afraid!\n\nFrom time to time, one of the animals would disappear (and without their knowledge, reappear on the farmer's dinner table).\n\nBut the farmer kept giving the animals delicious food without them making any effort, so they decided to believe the farmer's explanation that animal had escaped and been eaten by the wolf.\n\nMaybe, there was actually a wolf outside. But if they had escaped, only some of the animals would have been eaten by that wolf.\n\nBut by staying on the farm, all the animals were, sooner or later, eaten one by one.\n____\n\nTODO source.\n\nThis theme is also highlighted in many well known works/events.\n\nNorth Korea for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_North_Korea[China's good and trusty friend], is just a caricatural level of this, since it manages to be more a <<dictatorship,dictatorship>> than even China itself!\n\nIn fiction, <<nineteen-eighty-four>> is undoubtedly the most prominent example, in which the Party constantly switches from being at <<war,war>> with one country to the other in a never ending https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_war[perpetual war] (exactly like North Korea vs South Korea, or China vs <<taiwan>>).\n\nOne of the best related quotes comes in Part Two, Chapter 9 when Winston reads Emmanuel Goldstein's subversive text, one of the chapters contains (emphasis by Ciro):\n\n[[nineteen-eighty-four-war-is-peace]]\n____\nThe war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. **War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair**. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.\n____\n\nThis is also the first line of the party slogan, which perfectly resonates with the CCP:\n\n____\nWAR IS PEACE +\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY +\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n____\n\nor in Part One, Chapter 3:\n\n____\nSince about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.\n____\n\nThe theme is also mentioned in <<v-for-vendetta>>, where a <<covid,viral outbreak>> is used by governments to increase their power over the people.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/74Mw3N6WxG0?t=174 Cant Get You Out of My Head S01E05 Part Five The Lordly Ones also (2021, BBC) mentions that a huge propaganda machinery was created to spread the fake news that <<tiananmen>> was an evil western plot.\n\nDuplicate pool: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Aevil-west+\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md\n\n===== Friendly West-China moments\n\n====== United China Relief\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettis_Garside\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/葛思德\n\n____\nUnited China Relief was the largest humanitarian effort in the United States to aid the Chinese people up to that time.

At least one thing is decided from this: Ciro's children Chinese names will all be Ai Dao Something.\n\nThe family tree that Ciro has reconstructed orally from his mother-in-law is:\n\n* Ciro's wife:\n** Father: Ai Dayi (艾大义) born: 1932 in Shenyang\n*** Father: Ai Xikang (艾锡康) So why did he not use Yu?\n**** Father: Ai Pushan (艾溥?), so the Pu character is presumed from the generation name, to be the same generation as Puyi. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaitao has a Pushen (溥伸), but he died at 13 years old in 1928, so its not the one.\n**** Younger brother 2: Ai Xiyuan (艾锡?) Professor at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University_(China) Apparently had no Children.\n**** Younger brother 3: Ai Xicong (艾锡?) Graduated in law in Japan in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waseda_University[Waseda University] Was the top official of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Agency_(Japan) in China when it was occupied by Japan (警察廳长) Passed first by Taiwan.\n**** Younger brother 4: Ai Xiying (艾锡?)\n**** Younger brother 5: Ai Xifu (艾锡?) Together with Ai Xiying, they were went to the Republic of China Military Academy and were high ranking officials in the war against the Japanese in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War[] (八年抗战). Later was a congressman in Taiwan.\n** Younger sister: Ai Shiping (艾世？)\n** Older brother: Zhao Yingjie. Studied law in Japan also at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waseda_University[Waseda University].\n\nMany of them have had different names in different places/countries, notably many used the name 肇(Zhao) rather than 艾.\n\nFurther anecdotal indicators follow.\n\nCiro's wife and family are clearly of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people[Manchu ethnicity] just by looking at them, and they originally lived in the North East of China\n\nHis wife's family name is the very unusual 艾, pronounced \"ai4\", which she claims is a reference to the 愛(also pronounced ai4) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisin_Gioro[愛新覺羅], which is the name of the Manchu ruling clan of the Qing dynasty.\n\nCiro's father-in-law, who he barely met, was very old when he had his daughter, and passed away before Ciro could talk a lot with him, which is consistent with the claims that he spent several years in jail during <<mao-zedong,Mao's>> purges, see also: <<wife>>.\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_House_of_Aisin_Gioro\n* https://www.zhihu.com/question/34813921 现在清朝皇室的后代现状如何？ What is the current status of the descendants of the Qing royal family?\n* https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-descendants-of-the-Qing-Dynasty-left-currently\n* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6274.pdf \"Y Chromosome of Aisin Gioro, the Imperial House of Qing Dynasty\" unknown year.

See also: <<better-to-do>>.\n\nThe real goal of any online discussion, is not to convince people, but rather to determine who is an ally and who is not, and get those allies together to defeat the commies.\n\n[[flg-bias]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli support FLG just because his wife and mother-in-law do it?\n\nNot consciously, Ciro thinks would likely support them even if I didn't have family ties to <<falun-gong>>.\n\nLikely he wouldn't have started this campaign if he didn't know them of course.\n\nBut of course, this is impossible to answer objectively.\n\nWouldn't you be rather upset if your <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days>>?\n\nBut don't you think that <<flg-important,**70 million** people (6% of the total population in 2000!)>> getting completely squashed by the Party illustrates extremely well the dangers of the dictatorship?\n\nOr if a <<nazi,Jew has escaped a concentration camp>> and told the world about its horrors, would you just dismiss their claims due to their biased opinion?\n\nWith that in mind, Ciro tries his best to give FLG only the right level of exposure I think it deserves relative to other events, according to these guidelines: <<keyword-choice>>.\n\nIf more recent events of mass human rights violations happen, especially affecting in the order of tens of million people, I will probably rank higher than Falun Gong, this was the case for <<xinjiang,Xinjiang in 2019>> for example, even though it only affected a measly million.\n\n==== Why did Ciro Santilli start his keyword attack?\n\nThe last straw that led <<ciro-santilli>> to start the <<keyword-attack>> on <<stack-overflow>> was when on March 2015 his girlfriend's mother was arbitrarily kept 15 days in jail for doing <<falun-gong>>. He posted about this at:\n\n* https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576\n* https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174\n\nHe then continued because he hate political <<censorship,censorship>>, and because <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,I love China>>.\n\nEvery time Ciro thinks about this, he notices how stupid humans are. We see the forest fire smoke, and just never think that it will ever reach your home on the border of the forest.\n\nUntil it actually does, and then you are really fucked.\n\nSo in a sense it was a good thing that Ciro had this little backyard fire with this mother-in-law, as it woke him up further to how serious the CCP thread was, and led him to action.\n\nBecause before that, he was one of the majority who just constantly hears about the increasing mountain of evidence of human rights violations, and does nothing about it.\n\nThe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkest_Hour_(film)[Darkest Hour (2017) film] comes to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA1Uz_TMzhs[]. The movie shows that Britain was truly hesitant whether to negotiate or fight Hitler, even after the Nazis had already started invading other European countries, and would clearly not stop. Luckily, we are not at a position of war yet, and might never be due to nuclear weapons. But still, a similar blindness applies. <<covid>> woke up many people, but even then some haven't faced it.\n\n[[ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail]]\n===== Ciro Santilli's post when his mother-in-law was put into jail\n\nMaybe some people would be happy if their mother-in-law were put into jail.

The only reason that it is unofficially outlawed in China is because the communists fear it as a political competitor.\n\nThere was no trial and no explanation. She was going to take a train to visit her sister. But she didn't know that there was an important political event happening in the capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress So the police at the station, who already knew she did Falun Gong, took her away.\n\nWhen she came back home, the house had been searched and was all messed up. Her religious books and computer were missing.\n\nI'm glad she was not physically harmed. I find it fascinating how even well educated Chinese support a government which simply does not represent some of its people. How will you feel <<intolerance,when something like that happens to your own family, and there is nothing you can do about it>>?\n\n====== Jail post zh\n\nTranslation by <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,my wife>>:\n\n我女朋友的母亲，一位63岁的女士被监禁在一个中国的\"劳教所\"，只因为她炼法轮功。\n\n她被迫待在一个小屋子里面，只有一张床和一个排泄的地方，一直处在监视器下，每天两个窝头一碗只有几个白菜叶的汤。\n\n我看过法轮功https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong 只是一个和平的信仰，对相信它的人没有任何坏处。它在中国被非官方的定为违法（其实没有一项明确法律禁止），唯一的原因就是工产党害怕它是一个政治竞争对手。\n\n没有审讯没有任何解释。她正准备坐火车去看她的姐姐。但是她并不知道那个时候有重要的政治会议正在首都进行：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress\n所以那些知道她炼法轮功的铁路警察把她带走了。\n\n当她回到家中时，房子被搜查过了，四处一切混乱。她的信仰书籍和电脑都没有了。\n\n我很庆幸的是她身体并没有受到伤害。我觉得很意思的是一些受过良好教育的中国人怎么能够迫害一部分它的人民的政府呢？如果这样的事情发生在你的家庭，而你什么都不能做，你会怎么想？\n\n====== Jail post pt\n\nTranslation by myself:\n\nA mãe da minha namorada ficou 15 dias num \"centro de correção\" chines porque ela faz Falun Gong.\n\nEla ficou o tempo todo num quarto pequeno com uma cama e banheiro, sobe videovigilância, recebendo 3 refeições pequenas por dia.\n\nPara mim, o Falun Gong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong é apenas mais uma religião moderada que não causa nenhum problema para seus crentes. A única razão pela qual ele é proibido na China é porque os comunistas tem medo dele como competidor politico.\n\nNão houve julgamento nem explicação. Ela ia pegar um trem para ver sua irmã, mas ela não sabia que teria um evento político importante na capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress Então a polícia da estação, que já sabia que ela faz Falun Gong pegou ela.\n\nQuando ela voltou pra casa, a casa tinha sido procurada pela polícia e estava uma bagunça. Os livros religiosos e seu computador foram confiscados.\n\nEu fico feliz apenas que ela não sofreu abuso físico. Eu acho fascinante como mesmo muitos chineses educados apoiam ainda um governo que não representa parte do povo.

If all minorities were oppressed, everyone would be oppressed.\n\nDictatorships crush minorities much more than democracies.\n\nDo think the majority of the Chinese people would vote to put 50 year old <<falun-gong>> meditating <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,aunties in jail>>, if the CCP hadn't made a huge propaganda campaign and used an iron fist?\n\nAre the Chinese really that selfish to vote for this oppression, even as the <<censorship,free media>> would show videos of meditating old ladies in jail on national television? <<ciro-santilli>> does not believe this.\n\nMinorities are put in jail because the CCP fears them. Dictatorships can only survive if there is zero difference in opinion in the population.\n\nThe famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...[First they came ...] text comes to mind in which <<nazi,the priest Martin Niemöller regrets not having supported the rights of his opponents that were unfairly treated by the Nazi Government>>:\n\n[[first-they-came]]\n____\nFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out +\nBecause I was not a socialist.\n\nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out +\nBecause I was not a trade unionist.\n\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out +\nBecause I was not a Jew.\n\nThen they came for me +\nand there was no one left to speak for me.\n____\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<rule-of-law>>\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerance_(film)[Intolerance (1916) film]\n\n====== This is Ciro Santilli's personal problem, we have nothing to do with it, stop punishing us for it\n\nWe have to fight for justice for our fellows, or else when injustice happens to us, no one will fight for use either: <<intolerance>>.\n\nEvery form of protest incurs some damage.

The wumao used this to criticize Guantanamo bay, saying that it was like <<xinjiang-re-education-camps>> but in the USA, apparently unaware that this was a staged protest. So it actually has the exact opposite effect than intended: because there is no <<censorship>>, here people in the West can together to denounce something they don't like. Imagine if a crowd of 100 people in China got together to denounce the Xinjiang camps! They'd go to jail immediately. Furthermore as Ciro repeated a million times: Guantanamo bay detainees are not American citizens, and democracies cannot fully protect people who can't vote. In China however, no one can vote, so everyone can be oppressed. https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/171145[Source].\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Guantanamo_bay_protest_London_2008.jpg[height=600]\n\n[[henri-meyer]]\n.French political cartoon from 1898 by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Meyer[Henri Meyer] showing leaders of Western powers, Russia and Japan splitting up China between them.

Last <<wayback-machine>> archive as of that date: 2020-11-03.\n\nThe video description was:\n\n____\nThis is an exposé of racist companies that I worked for, some of which operate in the United States and Canada, all of which are headquartered in China.\n____\n\nIn it, Aaron describes his experiences with the recruitment team of one of his former employers, an unnamed \"Chinese ed-tech company in Beijing\", for which he worked in human resources. In another also deleted video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6uFGGunRxc he mentions that he cannot mention the name of the company because he was under NDA.\n\nNotably, in that video, he gives several screenshots of Google Sheets spreadsheets with explicitly racist reasons why people were not hired, one of which is <<we-dont-hire-blacks-screenshot,reproduced here>>. Examples of such reasons include:\n\n* \"Skin color\"\n* \"Non-Caucasian\"\n* \"62-years old\"\n* \"elderly\"\n* \"Hispanic\"\n\nHe mentions:\n\n____\nOn the first day at this company, I had an orientation with my supervisor Ng, who is the head of the training department. She told me:\n\n\"We hire blacks. Obama black is OK. But no darker, or they'll scare the kids. The kids will think they're some kind of monster!\" \n____\n\nwhich would lead parents to just go to a competitor instead. Then he mentions about the Google Sheets documents that:\n\n____\nThey shared this document with the entire management team in Beijing, and everyone not only knew, but expected this discrimination to take place.\n____\n\nIn the video he also explains how he once went to a 2 week holiday to Bali, and when he came back with his skin darker due to the tanning, he was reprimanded by a manager, who said that he could not work looking like that.\n\nHe explicitly mentions later the video that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIPKid[VIPKid], for which he did not work, is a similar company in nature, but not the one he is talking about.\n\nWikipedia mentions about VIPKid\n\n____\nIts online-classroom portal enables students to receive 25-minute English language lessons from fluent English-speaking teachers.\n\nIn March 2019, VIPKid fired two American teachers for discussing the 1989 <<tiananmen>> and <<taiwan>> with their students in China. Teachers have also reported witnessing child abuse when teaching lessons, but they found little recourse to report such issues.\n____\n\nAs of 2021-05-05, the banner image of VIPKid's website explicitly includes a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism[token black person]: https://web.archive.org/web/20210505045920/https://www.vipkid.com/[], so their PR department clearly caught air of this. This is however only a frontend for hiring American teachers. The real Chinese client website https://www.vipkid.com.cn/[], rest assured, contains no black people: (https://web.archive.org/web/20210424032446/https://www.vipkid.com.cn/[archive])\n\nVIPKids had a 3 billion valuation in https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/chinas-vipkid-which-links-native-english-speakers-with-online-learners-raises-another-500m-reportedly-at-3b-valuation/\n\nWikipedia links as one of its sources to this 2019 article https://www.wired.com/story/when-online-teaching-job-becomes-window-child-abuse/[] which mentions:\n\n____\nOf the dozens of companies vying to cash in on the tutoring business, it is by far the largest, having raised $825 million in investment capital since its founding. Other major players include Qkids, Magic Ears, DaDa, and Gogokid, all based in China. \n____\n\nso it is overwhelmingly likely that one of those is the one mentioned Aaron is talking about:\n\n* Qkids\n* Magic Ears\n* DaDa\n* Gogokid\n\nLater in the video Aaron mentions that the company in question \"basically went bankrupt\".\n\nHe also mentions that he later worked for https://www.forbes.com/companies/offcn-education-technology/?sh=6d49822b4e45[offcn], which is run by the Chinese Government, and they would absolutely not hire black people.\n\n[[we-dont-hire-blacks-screenshot]]\n.Screenshot of the video <<we-dont-hire-blacks-by-aaron-dewitt-2020>> showing a list racist job interview candidate rejection reasons.\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/We_don_t_hire_blacks_by_Aaron_DeWitt_2020.jpg[height=500]\n\n===== Western democracies have invaded other countries and crushed separatism\n\nYes, <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect,Western democracies are not perfect>>.\n\nWhat matters is that citizens can disagree with those actions, publicly say it, vote accordingly, and not go to jail, so that policy will be changed if the majority so wants.\n\nIn China, the minority controls the majority, and the majority cannot say anything even if they disagree.\n\nIf the majority wants to do evil however, evil will get done, it is impossible to prevent that.\n\nPeople from other countries don't vote for your politicians in democracy. Therefore, democracies cannot protect them.\n\nWhat democracy does do well is to <<brainwashed-by-usa,reduce the chance that enough of the population will be brainwashed>> into <<war,starting war with other superpowers and destroy the world>>.\n\nDo you really think <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens,China wouldn't invade a country they need resources from because they are more humane>>?\n\n<<too-young-too-naive>>. China is already invading its own citizens right now as of 2020 to obtain resources! <<xinjiang-re-education-camps>>. And it is using the exact same excuse as the American politicians: terrorism!\n\nEven when the US invades another country, the people who support the US enemy can still pick up arms and fight. And Russia can send help if they want to annoy the Americans, making local resistance stand an actual chance. But when you oppress your own people, they are completely defenseless, and 100% certain to be fully oppressed, since no foreign country would risk world war 3 by sending help.\n\nDo you really think that the CCP would give a fuck about invading other countries? And furthermore, China is specifically oppressing Islamic people in Xinjiang, exactly the same religion of people who live where? In the Middle East.\n\nXinjiang _is_ China's Middle East.\n\nThe reason the USA has invaded countries in the Middle east and China hasn't yet is a mixture of:\n\n* the USA is more developed, and has greater fuel needs, and greater capacity to carry such a war.\n+\nAlthough as we've seen, they've been essentially losing those wars quite often now, by not saying long enough to establish a new stable government.\n+\nPart of their defeat is also due to <<russia>>, and increasingly China, helping the other side however.\n* the Middle East is full of dictatorships, and <<dictatorships-tend-to-work-together,dictatorships are natural allies of other dictatorships>> therefore it is more likely that they won't invade one another.\n* the Cold War is still fresh in the American mind. Oil is crucial to fight a war. Countries will do anything to survive, even if it means killing others.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> is not saying that any of this justifies the actions of the Western powers in the Middle East. But simply that it has nothing to do with democracy or non-democracy.\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<separatism>>\n* <<richer>>\n\n[[hate-speech]]\n===== Western democracies also censor subjects such as child porn and hate speech\n\nFirst, child porn and hate speech are also banned in China, so shut up. <<china-has-more-freedom-of-speech-than-the-usa,every type of speech>> is less free in <<dictatorship>>.\n\nSecond, if you don't think child porn should be banned, there isn't much point in arguing with you.\n\nNow, hate speech is a very complex subject. <<ciro-santilli>> does feel that we should be very careful when banning hate speech, and he is not sure if it should be banned at all, as perhaps it might just make matters worse.\n\nBut of course, there is also censorship in Western democracies, and there is a gray area between what should be censored or not.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> only argues that there is on type of speech that must never ever be <<censorship,censored>>: political speech.\n\nThis way, the majority can always discuss and vote to change what can be censored or not.\n\nIn China, however, trying to discuss such changes in laws <<internal-censorship,puts you in jail>>, so bad laws cannot be changed. This lack of freedom <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,also gives the impression to many brainwashed Chinese>> that dicatorships are better because you see less conflict online. Which is great, until your human rights are violated, and you've got no one to talk to.\n\nThe lack of ability to discuss political problems leads to extremely serious problems:\n\n* <<corruption>>: politicians can <<internal-censorship,censor>> anything bad that they did to stay in power\n* <<war>>: if the CCP leaders decide that a war must be made, everyone who opposes it will go to jail, and the war will be made\n* <<intolerance>>: if the CCP decides that <<xinjiang,some minority>> is <<falun-gong,a danger to their power>>, this minority gets fucked\n\nDeciding on hate speech, means having to decide what level of hardcoreness we are willing to accept, and there is no clear right or wrong answer.\n\nFor example, which of the following do you think should be banned:\n\n* This scientific study suggests that white people do less well in IQ tests.\n* This scientific study suggests that black people do less well in IQ tests.\n* I'm an idiotic irrational racist and I dislike white/black people. I won't kill them, but I dislike them, and I can't change that, I'm really sorry.\n* Let's all gather together and kill our black/white/gay/straight/Muslim/Christian neighbours tomorrow.\n* Let's all gather together and kill our oppressive dictator/president tomorrow.\n\nCiro believes that none of the above should ever be censored, because any form of \"hate-speech censorship\" immediately opens a precedent for political censorship.\n\nIf someone is idiotic enough to organize illegal acts like hurting someone publicly before doing it, it will just make it easier for them to get caught.\n\nAnd if its just empty words, just block those idiots to not see their posts, or downvotes their posts to reduce their impact.\n\nAnd if the majority supports idiotic acts like killing someone because of their race, it will get done in a democracy regardless, because that's what democracies do: they cater to what the majority wants.\n\nThere's not point in censoring them. Such censorship only makes things worse, as the perpetrators will use that as publicity for their cause.\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<richer>>\n* <<intolerance>>\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window[Overton window]\n\n====== Fake news\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/假新聞\n\nWhen a government controls all information to make it look good, and no one can challenge it, you cannot trust _any_ of the news produced by that country, as anything could be fake.\n\nIt is much better to have some fake news, but also few sources that are likely telling the truth.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> is also extremely critical of Western social media companies such as <<twitter>> and Facebook which have censored \"fake news\" from real legitimate accounts or real people, which is a point that Trump has justly criticized in Ciro's opinion.\n\nIf it is from a Chinese/Russian botnet, sure, destroy those accounts.\n\nBut from legitimate accounts of citizens? The people have to decide for themselves what is fake or real, not you, Twitter and Facebook. If the majority is made of idiots who believe in fake news, then so be it, that's how democracy works.\n\nCensoring any citizen, no matter how stupid you think they are, creates a precedent for dictatorship, and even an <<luxor,incentive to terrorism>>.\n\nMore interesting case is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_First_Amendment_Institute_v._Trump[]. Ciro feels strongly that people who try to have meaningful discussions on Twitter should automatically lose a lawsuit, and that people should be able to block whoever they want from their personal controlled accounts or forums. It is only the companies who provide the forum service that must be neutral.\n\n====== Unjust social media censorship in the West\n\n* Trump social media bans:\n** 2021-03-31 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/03/31/conservatives-blast-facebook-for-removing-trump-interview-with-daughter-in-law/ \"Conservatives Blast Facebook For Removing Trump Interview With Daughter-In-Law\".

Including any information that hundreds of thousands of people have witnessed, or economic performance metrics! See also: <<internal-censorship>>.\n\nThe level of unknown surveillance that Snowden uncovered is a bad thing about the US.\n\nSnowden's prosecution was inevitable. Countries need secret services. Secret services need laws that prevent leaking classified information that was produced by government officials.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> has never and will never criticize China or any other country for spying or prosecuting spies.\n\nIf Snowden were Chinese, the Chinese government would ban talking about him or anything he uncovered. A <<keyword-attack,keyword attack>> with \"Snowden\" in the West has no effect.\n\nIt is obvious that the level of surveillance in any dictatorship will be infinitely higher, since the Government has much more power and no-one can criticize.\n\nOn the West however, the debate Snowden sparked cannot be censored, and has helped to control excessive and secret state power.\n\nUltimately, Ciro thinks camera surveillance is somewhat inevitable, because people will always want to fight crime and terrorism and surveillance technology keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.\n\nHe is however strictly against the ban of cryptography.\n\nHe also believes that a good solution to balance out government power is the <<second-amendment>>. It is better to have more school shootings and less full-blown dictatorship led genocides / mass human rights violations.\n\nIn 2019 China amusingly censored passages Snowden's \"Permanent Record\" autobiography book, which Snowden then published on Twitter:\n\n* https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784 (https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083232/https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784[archive])\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083147/https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/[archive]).\n\nAs a https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/f7axckl/[Redditor put it]:\n\n____\nI don't think they understand that what Snowden stands for is completely the opposite of what the Chinese gov is lol\n____\n\nSnowden then later released the entire Chinese version of the book for free online with the censored parts underlined: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200213001653/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship[archive]), link to the book: link:++https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf++[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200212144108/https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf[archive]). One wonders why he didn't just do that in the first place for all versions, maybe he needed to pay the writer that helped him?\n\n.Snowden highlighted defects on abuses of power in a Western democracy, and the discussion he sparked helped to control such abuses. <<to-obey-is-to-betray,To obey is to betray>> comes to mind. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edward_Snowden-2.jpg[Source].\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Snowden.jpg[height=500]\n\n===== Bad things have been done in the name of freedom\n\nE.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks[September 11th].\n\nBad things have been done in the name of anything.\n\nIt's just that <<war,much>>, <<xinjiang,worse>> <<tiananmen,things>> are done without freedom than with it.\n\nDemocracies cannot necessarily protect weak countries from powerful ones either. No political system can do that, because humans are trash essentially.\n\nWhat democracy do is to protect its own people against its own government. Because when the government turns against part of the population in a dictatorship, that part of the population gets crushed entirely, without any chance to fight, because they don't have an army or ally countries like other countries do.\n\nHere are some images that <<wumao>>'s like to post:\n\n* Left Right Slaughterhouse comic: https://9gag.com/gag/ayn7KmW?ref=fbp\n\n[[ccp-evil]]\n=== Is the Chinese government evil? 中国共产党是邪恶吗？\n\nObviously not, just <<richer,inefficient>> and <<war,dangerous>>.\n\nIt is just another non-democratic empire like the Qing Dynasty, we might as well cal it:\n\n____\n共产朝 +\nThe Communist Dynasty\n____\n\nExpression previously mentioned at: https://web.archive.org/web/20161025220242/http://tieba.baidu.com/p/752094668\n\nLike any other organization and individual everywhere in the entire world, they are just doing everything that they can to maintain their own power.\n\nIt just happens that China's the current is political system allows the CCP to do really bad things.\n\nAnd it should also be noted that <<henri-meyer,it is in part the West's fault>> that China currently has this shitty system.\n\n<<falun-gong>> thinks otherwise of course, they think the CCP is actually made up of real actual devils in some dimension: <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>>.

But at least they have to pretend a little.\n\nBy John Kenneth Galbraith, possibly based on an earlier <<soviet-union>> joke https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ocasio-cortez-capitalism-quote/[]:\n\n____\nUnder capitalism, man oppresses man.

It mainly comes down to a way of avoiding any rational conversation about China's obvious problems by highlighting <<not-chinese>>.\n\nOr maybe they just want to waste Ciro's time.\n\nSuch idiots don't see however that every major slang is Googleable, and that every overly obscure slang is already not understandable by a large part of the Chinese population, and won't be understood by anybody in 5 years, so that you are wasting your time writing this gibberish. But since you are an idiot, it's not like you have anything better to do with your time, so maybe it doesn't matter.\n\nIf you want to efficiently prevent anyone from understanding your stuff, Ciro recommends that you just use SHA-256 instead:\n\n....\n$ printf 'heil xi' | sha256sum\n286b183bf41d6c9de5315bbd64f1ca35a58157ae2e7f38086978c108e67c4882  -\n....\n\nA Chinese insult tip 101, avoid similar sound euphemisms.

So someone came and suggested adding this project to the list at: https://github.com/leiroc/insults/issues/4[], which is obviouly censored in China, as an example. They even have an <<icp-license>> at https://insults.cn/[], isn't that cute?\n\nTo which the repo owner replied:\n\n____\n感谢提交，这个人有点疯狂了。我就不给加到记录里面了，因为加进去，看到的人就会更加多。对于这些信息不是所有人都有分别真伪的能力。害怕有些人信了他的，或者被他诱导。所以还是让他消声少曝光的好，这些人国家肯定一直在监控的，我们可以放心。\n____\n\nGoogle Translate:\n\n____\nThanks for submitting, this person is a bit crazy.

These people and countries must have been monitoring them, so we can rest assured.\n____\n\nThis perfecly shows the ruhua paradox.

Will he ever be able to go to China again to re-experience such marvelous locations? If the CCP falls before he dies, and if the statue hasn't been destroyed by the commies, Ciro will return to that exact spot and take a second picture. How will he look like?\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Ciro_Santilli_with_a_stone_carved_Budai_in_the_Feilai_Feng_caves_near_the_Lingyin_Temple_in_Hangzhou_in_2012.jpg[height=500]\n\nBut he doesn't think it is a good idea for him to do that now, in case his Visa got accepted, because he is not interested in learning about the Chinese jail system! :-)\n\nHe knows that if you don't mind contributing to making <<war,WW3>> deadlier and shut up and obey the CCP, China is already a fine place to live as much as any other developing country.\n\n===== Would Ciro Santilli like to live in China?\n\nIf the dictatorship ends, <<ciro-santilli>> would like to <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,migrate to China>> if given a decent job to help China develop and become awesomer.\n\nBefore the Dictatorship, Ciro likely won't be able to enter/it wouldn't be a good idea: <<would-ciro-santilli-be-able-to-visit-china-before-the-ccp-ends>>.\n\nAnd it is immoral to help make dictatorships richer by working for their companies: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.\n\n===== Would Ciro Santilli be able to visit China before the CCP ends?\n\nIt would be interesting to apply for a VISA to find out.\n\nBut Ciro won't do it because it is too risky that it would be a waste of Ciro's precious <<better-to-do,time and money>>.\n\nFirstly, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399[Jamal Khashoggi] taught us that walking into enemy into consulates of enemy countries is a bad idea.\n\nThen, even if the VISA were accepted, Ciro could still be turned back on entering the country, thus wasting the flight time and money. This could either be a genius plot to waste the money of enemies of the state, or due to a crappy divided IT system between the border control and the VISA people.\n\nFinally, even after the border, there is still the possibility that Ciro could be stopped in the country half-way through the visit and sent back, or be interrogated for a few days, or less likely murdered with poison.\n\nTherefore, if you think that living in China is fundamental to understand it, please just explain what you think one can learn from the experience instead. Do you really need to live there to see its censorship machine working? It would arguably be harder to see it from the inside.\n\nSee also: <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship>>.\n\nBibliography: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/93\n\n[[is-ciro-santilli-chinese]]\n==== Is Ciro Santilli Chinese? 三西猴是中国人吗？\n\nSee: https://cirosantilli.com/#ciro-santilli\n\nAnd it does not matter: <<not-chinese>>.\n\nBut <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,his wife is>>.\n\n[[does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli speak Chinese? 三西猴会说中文吗？\n\nAs of 2019, oral enough for daily things, but not understand most natural casual dinner conversation or watch TV series, because they go too quickly into vocabulary subject areas that he doesn't know. And obviously, using <<slang,slangs>> just makes things really hard.\n\nWhen it matters, and with some patience, he can make himself understood though with https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/[some analogies] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190908144612/https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/[archive]) and a dictionary.\n\nFrom the HSK vocabulary list, he estimates that he is definitely HSK 3, but not quite HSK 4. This would likely equate A2/B1 in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages[European system].\n\nPhonetics wise, Ciro can't distinguish or produce a few sounds, notably `-ing` vs `-in` and his off-tone rate is high, but it tends to not matter at all compared to his lack of vocabulary. Except for his <<wife,mother-in-law>>, who sometimes does not understand it at all without correct tones!\n\nCiro reads with link:https://www.perapera.org/[Perapera] when he wants to learn new words/has patience/something is very important, and can basically understand everything in that way. TODO perapera support stopped in 2021: https://www.perapera.org/plugins/ and since browsers don't have stable API's it very quickly stopped working for everyone.

Ciro really loves the Chinese language. But he has other more important endeavors at the moment. There simply aren't enough hours in a day.\n\nSpoken Chinese is in Ciro's opinion a relatively easy language to learn from scratch, because word formation is so often logical:, e.g.:\n\n* volcano = fire + mountain: 火山(huo shan)\n* train = fire + car: 火车 (huo che), a reference to old https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive[steam locomotives]\n\nand there is no useless crap like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation[verb grammatical conjugation], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender[grammatical gender], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural[plural inflection], capitalization, etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione[latino sine flexione] anyone?)\n\nCiro <<characters,hasn't tried to learn characters>> because <<chinese-characters-are-insane,too much effort>>, but he did learn some of the most common ones without trying.\n\nCiro initially learnt from book that come with audio recordings in the first 6-months to 1 year in 2010, but that got impossibly boring afterward, so he later moved to just basically talking as much as possible non-important things to <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,his wife in Chinese>>, and whenever he reaches one that he doesn't know that seems useful, he Plecos it up or just 怎么说 to his <<wife>> and then Pleco.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that Ciro also feels that it would be better if all countries more officially adopted English as an international language that everyone should learn for reasons explained at: https://cirosantilli.com/#having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world\n\n[[chinese-characters-are-insane]]\n===== Chinese characters are insane (汉字是疯狂的)\n\nMaybe the commies for once <<richer,did something good>> by introducing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters[simplified Chinese characters (简化字)]?\n\nBut they should have gone further and reduced it to pinyin like the Korean and Vietnamese did, this will make your culture much easier to export.\n\nNo foreign adult will every learn to read and write Chinese unless they are completely obsessed by the culture or need it as part of their jobs. And even then, they will avoid it at all costs, because life is just too short!\n\nJapanese https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana[furigana] also comes to mind.

Still, the area is much smaller without a doubt.\n* single character emoticons like \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiong[囧]\", before the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons_(Unicode_block)[Emoticons Unicode block]! Yes, when your language has a character so useless that it becomes an emoticon, maybe you should start to worry that something went wrong somewhere...

The fact that she is one of the most intelligent, morally upright, cute, and \"never give up\" person I know may have helped me choose too.\n\n[[selfish]]\n==== Ciro Santilli's China freedom campaign is selfish\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<flg-bias>>\n* <<throne>>\n* <<harm-programmers>>\n\n[[famous]]\n===== Ciro Santilli is doing his China freedom campaign to become famous\n\nNo, he am a selfless human being, only concerned with the greater well being of humankind.\n\nMore serious answer:\n\n* he believes in this.

If your <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days>>, for following the same religion that <<flg-bias,your wife follows>>, and if you had a social media presence, wouldn't you be tempted to do the same?\n\nWhat about you, are you funded by the CCP?\n\nSee also: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/48a95bf57a16b85619a6ae68702d18c9a5078797/FAQ.md#flg-has-been-funded-by-the-us-government-at-least-once-therefore-it-is-evil\n\nLabel: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/funded-by-cia-argument\n\n==== Would Ciro Santilli be doing his China freedom campaign if he was in China?\n\nNot with his real name attached to it, see also:\n\n* <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship>>\n* <<not-chinese>>\n\n===== Does your employer support this?\n\nMy employer has nothing to do with this.\n\nHe doesn't approve or disapprove of the Chinese government or of my private actions.\n\nThe only thing that my employer _does_ believe in is that employees can have their own political opinions, and that this should not affect hiring decisions.\n\nObviously, this action limits my ability to lead high profile deals with China.\n\nAlso I'm quite curious if this would limit my ability to go to China for business, but I haven't applied for a visa since I've started this. It likely wouldn't be a good idea for me to go to China :-)\n\nBut my employer believes that inclusion and non-discrimination are more valuable.\n\nI will always do my best to not let my personal opinions affect my professional decisions, as that would be unfair to my employer.\n\n[[better-to-do]]\n==== Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China?\n\nIn 1989, besides <<tiananmen>> and <<ciro-santilli>>'s birth, a beautiful thing called the World Wide Web was invented!\n\nThe Internet gives everyone the magic power of writing something, and having million people read it for free!\n\nThis is how much time Ciro spends on this project to give you an idea:\n\n* every week or two, someone sends me a message, he reply with \"read the FAQ\", and usually update\n* Ciro https://www.reddit.com/r/China amongst many other programming subs, and all major bad news show up there. See also: <<anti-ccp-info-sources>>\n* when something bad enough comes up, Ciro go to https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/sensitive-words-series/ by <<china-digital-times>>and update <<keyword-attack,his keyword attack>>. He's only been updating it on Stack Overflow and GitHub these days.\n\nThen Ciro just contributes to programming websites exactly as he would if he weren't making this campaign, and voila.\n\nEdit: to be fair, the end of 2019 and start of 2020 was such as hot year with <<2019-hong-kong-anti-extradition-bill-protests>> and <<covid>> that Ciro might have spent a tiny little bit more ;-)\n\nBut Ciro did it only when his brain was too tired of technical stuff and unable to do more, or as a brain warm up routine in the morning.\n\nTelling the CCP to fuck off is surprisingly relaxing, you should try it some time too. It uses a different part of your brain other than the programming one. It is, one could say, an art form.\n\n=== People in China have already considered democracy, and rejected it\n\nOK, shall we put that to an anonymous vote just to make sure?\n\nDear sir or madam: do you want more control over your government? y/n\n\nOops, I forgot that <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,proposing such a vote would put in you jail>>, nevermind.\n\n[[violence]]\n=== Would it be right to use violence to overthrow the CCP?\n\nIn an ideal world, Ciro Santilli is of course \"against violence\".\n\nBut what if you could prevent a lot of future violence with some violence today?\n\nAh, the eternal question which only God can answer:\n\n* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-quote-The-end-justifies-the-means \"What is the origin of the quote 'The end justifies the means?'\"\n** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism[Consequentialism]\n** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem[Trolley problem]\n* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance[Nonviolent-resistance]\n\nDo you really think that the communists will step down if you ask them nicely enough?

Obviously https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution[through violence]. And likely due to earlier <<not-chinese,Japanese invasions which weakened the Guomindang>>.\n\nAnd the CCP actually uses \"the ends justify the means\" as an argument to justify its own actions: <<overlook-human-rights-for-profit>>.\n\nThe question of if anything is morally right or wrong makes no sense. All that matters is: what is the government that maximizes the happines of its own people, and who has the power to do what? <<richer,Getting richer,>> is part of the equation, but so is <<rule-of-law,not being constantly affraid that you will be randomly put in jail for no good reason>>.\n\nIf you do decide to strike though, <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship,stay safe, gather your forces on the Internet, and only strike when victory seems certain>>.\n\nFor \"violence is illegal\" arguments, see also: <<follow-the-law>>.\n\n.One baby <<nazi,Hitler>> or 5 Million Jews https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem[trolley problem] illustrates well the moral dilemma of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism[\"the ends justify the means\"].\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Baby_Hitler_vs_5_million_Jews_trolley_problem.jpg[height=400]\n\n.Translation: What women think men want (a kiss).

Maybe because you are not doing the right thing?\n\nCiro also believes that although terrorists must be fought with all our strength, they must also be given some degree respect (interspersed simultaneously <<sacred-cows,with humour>>). He sometimes prefers the term \"warriors\" or \"fighters\", because their actions are largely indistinguishable from many ideological or purely greed based actions that larger nation states have done many times over and over. It is just a war, plain and simple.\n\nThe reason why they kill mostly civilians is that they don't have the means to kill the presidents those civilians elected.

Your profile and activity continues to remain viewable throughout the rest of the countries in which LinkedIn is available.

But the decision whether to update your profile is yours.\n\nIn February 2014, we began offering a localized version of LinkedIn in China. We believe that people everywhere can benefit from Chinese individuals connecting with each other and LinkedIn members in other parts of the world, and that the creation of economic opportunity can have a profound impact on their lives and the lives of their families and communities.\n\nWhile we strongly support freedom of expression, we recognized when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China.

想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？\n\nFirst of all, hide and stay safe, unless you can deal the final blow. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War[World at war, 1973], ep. 16:\n\n____\nA dictatorship is like a snake. If you put your foot on its tail as you do it, it will just bite you and nobody will be helped. You have to strike the head.\n____\n\nOnce that is taken care of, a few good options are:\n\n* hide your thoughts, manipulate your enemies, infiltrate the corporate, political and military power circles, and go up the ladder\n* if you are an technological innovator, leave China and come work for the West. Don't strengthen commie power.\n+\nAlternatively, with technology you could also try the anonymous rebellion route, but the risk of getting caught is significant, leaving the country first is likely a good idea. See also:\n+\n** <<terminus2049>>\n** <<programthink>>\n\nIf you don't manage to do either of the above, don't do any technological work. Go work on the fields or washing dishes. Working well for Chinese companies makes the Chinese <<dictatorship,Dictatorship>> stronger and <<war,more deadly>>. See also: <<embargo>>.\n\nAnd regardless: remember your kids that the commies are bastards every day.\n\n[[reply-policy]]\n=== Ciro Santilli's reply policy (三西猴的回答政策)\n\nPeople get kind of passionate sometimes about politics. And some of them might also be just malicious <<wumao,wumaos>>, although it is generally not possible to distinguish between them.\n\nIf you are not a wumao, consider this:\n\n* Ciro Santilli is one, and antagonists are millions. It is therefore not possible to reply to all antagonists.\n* Ciro has in the past tried to be nice to stupid people, and they gave nasty replies\n* all discussion is useless, <<effective,only the keyword attack has any chance of having any effect, and even that is slim>>\n\nIn order to not waste too much time on those, Ciro Santilli uses the following strategy.\n\nIf the original thread post is not very interesting, try to parse it quickly and reply once, always <<better-to-do,linking to the FAQ>>, and then unfollow the thread. This shows that you're still alive, and takes little effort.\n\nAlways quote reply, and always write down the ID of the OP on your reply, because discussions like this lead to a large number of comment and account deletions, which could make your reply not make much sense without the context.\n\nAfter the link addressing anything that they might have said, add three randomly selected images from this repository to it. This is fundamental because the average <<little-pink>> does not speak English. Therefore writing is pointless.\n\nMeme images, however, cross the language barrier beautifully. It is even better if they have Chinese captions.\n\nAnother way to see it is that we are creating a harder to censor <<instagram>> channel.\n\nYou can think of them metaphorically as throwing hand grenades over the <<gfw>>. Ciro strives to add the following elements in the image itself where applicable:\n\n* English explanation\n* Chinese explanation\n* date\n* location\n\nBecause the <<censorship,CCP censors politics>>, and the West does not, we can never \"lose\" a shitargument. Even if the <<wumao>> supports his country in a thread, just being in the same thread as the censored material could already be problematic for the wumao, as it is proof that they've seen something they should not have seen.\n\nTherefore the only option for them is to run away.\n\nCiro has since then created a reply bot based on <<github>> Actions that does the above automatically, therefore handling 99% of the work, see:\n\n* link:action.js[]\n* link:.github/workflows/issue.yml[]\n\nThe bot works beautifully because it makes Ciro not feel the need to reply to every idiot <<wumao>> that comes along. Also Ciro can hide like a coward behind the bot by editing the bot's comment, which is perfect. This reminded Ciro from something that was said in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul[Better Call Saul] S01 E01:\n\n____\nAnd they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend.\n\n\"Talk to me,\" he says. \"Help me clear this thing up.\"\n\n\"You don't need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers.\"\n\nAnd, boom, hey, that's when it all goes south.\n\nThat's when you want someone in your corner.\n\nSomeone who will fight tooth and nail.\n\nLawyers, we're like health insurance.\n\nYou hope you never need it, but, man, oh, man, not having it? No.\n____\n\nThe bot is basically Ciro's lawyer, always loyally on his corner of the fighting ring.\n\nCiro considers this a form of \"asymmetric information warfare\", a mixture of the concepts of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare[asymmetric warfare] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare[information warfare]. The dictatorship has <<censorship>>, and legions of non-anonymous supporters. And the anti-censorship has memes, and a few anonymous supporters.\n\nFinally, also try to extract the email of the user from one of their repositories. When successful, Ciro takes a <<wayback-machine>> snapshot of the repository as proof of SHA, and then forks it to https://github.com/wumaoland to possibly keep their email safe in case of account deletion. You never know when this information might be useful.\n\nThen, after replying, do your best never to read the inevitable reply again, and above all, never ever reply. An interesting reply never follows from a non-interesting original post. It is hard at first, but you will eventually get the hang of it.\n\nIf the user keeps generating notifications, block them as per link:CONTRIBUTING.md[], replying to a single person multiple times is useless.\n\nNever block users for an initial <<shitpost,shitposts>>, just reply with a stupid joke instead. This approach creates more uncertainty and makes you look cooler. It also allows you to identify who the enemy is. Only block if the user is generating multiple notifications.\n\nIf a shitpost is made on most other social media except GitHub issues in this repository, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, immediately block the user on that website if you have the permission to do that, with a canned reply:\n\n____\nHi <idiot's name>, I don't reply to China issues here, please open an issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues instead, cheers.\n____\n\nNote however that this is not possible on idiotic websites like <<quora>> where such comments may be deleted, possibly automatically, who the fuck knows, e.g. as done at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli/comment/143227962 In that case just link to sections of the FAQ, or mute people, or maybe just block all comments on the post to not waste time with new useless notifications.\n\nThis is because it is not worth answering anywhere else where the information will be scattered and impossible to find later on, and especially on websites that are already blocked in China. Shitposts on Stack Overflow and other non-blocked websites are encouraged however, as they further help to get the website blocked in China.\n\nFor outbursts of activity from Chinese websites, usually programming (<<backlinks,v2ex, hacpai, pincong>>), only post the following canned answer and nothing else, because cowards/people who don't know English from the website might delete your posts, so you shouldn't waste time there with that shit:\n\n____\n大家你好\n\n在我的GitHub中国FAQ repository我已经回答了好几个关于我常见的问题。\n\n你们要是在那儿找不到一个回答，请在那个repository开一个issue，我马上就回答。\n\n我不要再在这个网页评论。\n____\n\nFinally, don't forget the golden rule from https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-4.htm[Proverbs 26:4]:\n\n____\nDon't answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are.\n____\n\nwhich is now usually seen in the form https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66460/origin-of-do-not-argue-with-idiots[of unclear attribution]:\n\n____\nNever argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.\n____\n\nWhere basically idiot == someone who creates posts that obviously aren't teaching you any new useful thing, or that not praising you :-)\n\nAlternatively, there is also the Chinese https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu[chengyu] version:\n\n____\n对牛弹琴\n____\n\nwhich means:\n\n____\nPlaying the <<music,qin>> to a cow.\n____\n\nwhich means to talk to someone who does not have intellectual conditions of understanding what you are trying to say, bibliography:\n\n* https://www.theepochtimes.com/chinese-idiom-playing-the-qin-to-a-cow_766205.html\n* https://baike.baidu.com/item/对牛弹琴/3490\n\nMore <<wumao,wumao>> focused strategies at: <<how-to-deal-with-wumaos>>.\n\n.https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-super-effective[It's Super Effective!] meme by <<ciro-santilli>> describing how he deals with <<wumao,wumaos>> and <<little-pink,little pinks>>.

When they were seated, the owner of the restaurant asked the President's Secret Service if he could please speak to the First Lady in private. They obliged and Michelle had a conversation with the owner.\n\nFollowing this conversation President Obama asked Michelle, \"Why was he so interested in talking to you?\" She mentioned that in her teenage years, he had been madly in love with her. President Obama then said, \"So if you had married him, you would now be the owner of this lovely restaurant,\" to which Michelle responded, \"No. If I had married him, he would now be the President.\"\n____\n\n=== How do different websites view Ciro Santilli's profile?\n\n<<meant-to-be-used>> contains a more general overview.

Including that the cost of freedom.\n\nThis therefore morally justifies the take-down attempts made by hundreds of <<wumao>>s against Ciro's anti Xi Jinping content.\n\nFirst by initiative of Stack Overflow employee https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/508266/cesar-m[Cesar Manara (Brazilian)], the sentence:\n\n____\nI think Trump is disgusting as a person\n____\n\nwas removed from Ciro's profile and notified.\n\nIn response, Ciro created a meta thread to confirm that the community agreed, and they did: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361486/can-i-say-on-my-profile-that-i-find-that-an-ex-president-of-a-country-or-other[Can I say on my profile that I find that an (ex) president of a country or other major political public figure is “disgusting as a person”?] and the community agreed with the removal: it reached only 5 upvotes and 25 downvotes.

The overly speedy deletion of posts was then raised as an issue two days later for an unrelated post: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/405585/can-we-slow-down-on-the-deletes-on-meta-folks\n\nThen Ciro created an answer to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286082/does-the-be-nice-policy-require-se-users-to-be-nice-to-people-who-are-not-se-u/361497#361497[\"Does the Be Nice policy require SE users to “be nice” to people who are not SE users (e.g. public figures)?\"] which is a superset of the previous ones referred by them. That post is reproduced at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/198#issuecomment-787047242 It cites the case in which the law was tested, but it was single-handedly by journeyman-geek (from Singapore) without any justification.\n\nCiro then finally updated his profile picture to contain <<xi-pooh-photoshop>>, archive at: https://archive.vn/iV1L8 to test the Winnie-the-Pooh case which people simply refused to answer.

Stack Exchange is an apolitical platform, and we like to keep politics as for away from our content as possible. Our little nook on the net is about Graphic Design, which has nothing to do with politics (even though it is used in the political arena all the time).\n\nWe acknowledge that politic profiles are somewhat allowed as per https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok, although we do question the usefulness of 'campaigning' through a Stack Exchange profile.\n\nWe want to draw the line however at political content. There is no need to use images or other content that might be controversial or cause emotional distress, while another image or content would serve the same function. That is why we deleted you answer on this question.\n\nWe want to welcome you on our site and encourage you to keep contributing with answers. Your other answers are fine, and judging by the amount of votes, mostly well-received by the community. You may repost the answer if you can swap out the images for more neutral ones.\n\nAt the same time we want to warn you that this type of content will not be tolerated in the future and further infractions may lead to more severe consequences.\n\nThanks for your understanding an cooperation, we wish you a pleasant experience on GDSE.\n\nRegards,\n\nGraphic Design Stack Exchange Moderation Team\n____\n\nCiro's reply:\n\n____\nHi,\n\nIs this a policy specific to graphic design website, or is it network wide, and is there an open meta question for it?\n____\n\nThe mods then changed their discourse to mention spam rules rather than only on the \"people will feel bad\" aspect:\n\n____\nThe https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/conduct[code of conduct]:\n\nBe inclusive and respectful.\n\nExposing others to images of violent and traumatic events is not respectful to those on whom those images have a strong effect. This is only acceptable if the topic of the question make this inevitable, which also suffices to warn of those who are triggered by those images: Images about violent events are to be expected in a question about such events, not in a question about concatenating two images.\n\nRules against spam:\n\nA post should be marked as spam only if it advertises a product, service, or similar and is unsolicited or lacks disclosure.\n[…]\nUnsolicited means that mentioning the product serves no purpose other than promotion. […]\n\nYou were promoting a political position and including the promotional content (instead of a neutral picture) served no purpose other than promotion. It’s analogous to using a picture advertising a product as an example.\n____\n\nOK, the spam argument would likely win.\n\nCiro then hacked the images to his <<the-world-is-perfect,\"The world is perfect\">> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch[kitsch] placeholder, and mods approved it, so here we go.\n\nCiro was planning the following meta post, but gave up on it:\n\n____\nCan I use political images as placeholders for questions involving images when it does not affect the validity of the answer?\n\nFor example when answering the following ImageMagick question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20737061/merge-images-side-by-sidehorizontally/63575228#63575228 I used an image with political content.\n\nThe choice of the placeholder was completely arbitrary, and does not affect the answer in any way.\n\nBut today admins of Graphic Design Stack Exchange https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/83446/gimp-how-to-combine-two-images-side-by-side/145543#145543 deleted the post saying it is not allowed on the Graphic Design website.\n\n> We want to draw the line however at political content. There is no need to use images or other content that might be controversial or cause emotional distress, while another image or content would serve the same function. That is why we deleted you answer on this question.\n\nThe admins mention that on profiles it is OK linking to: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok but on answers it is not.\n\nSo I would like to clarify if:\n\n* is this a policy specific to Graphic Design or if it applies to the entire network.\n* if it applies to the entire network:\n** Can I use images of myself, Ciro Santilli, or is that currently considered political content?\n** At https://stackoverflow.com/a/57389607/895245 I needed several images, and I had used a list of USA presidents in chronological order without much thought. Do I have to modify that answer to use another set of images?\n____\n\nand planned answer:\n\n____\n**Any images that can be used on a profile picture should also usable as a placeholder**\n\nWhen you answer a question, you should have a very wide choice of what to use as a placeholder.\n\nPolitics is a perfectly legal topic, just like flowers, animals, and scenery.\n\nThe \"can it be used on the profile picture\" test should already filter out any content that is deemed unacceptable due to legal concerns.\n\nAnother issue is that it is extremely difficult and possibly unfair to classify what is political or not.\n\nSuppose that Ciro Santilli became famous enough outside of programming circles such that he starts to be considered a political subject.\n\nWould his images then start to be considered political content?\n\nBut that would be discriminatory against certain people and not others.\n\nFreedom of speech is extremely valuable, and we should be very careful about restricting it.\n\nThere are people literally unfairly dying, right now, because they don't have it.\n\nDo you really want to reduce yours?\n\nThe only way to prevent history from repeating itself, is to remember it.\n____\n\nRelated spam meta posts:\n\n* https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-rude-or-abusive-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-wor\n* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260638/what-is-the-exact-definition-of-spam-for-stack-overflow\n\n[[the-world-is-perfect]]\n.\"The world is perfect\" by Ciro Santilli, CC By-SA 4.0 (2021).

Instead of redoing the tutorial from scratch, Ciro just pasted the new image on top of the old one Stack Exchange censored: <<tank-man-cc-by-sa,Ciro Santilli's CC BY-SA Tank Man image>>.

The CCP is now evil, so you can criticize it, even if it shocks Chinese people. Ah, Nazism shocks us, even though it is an event from the past, so that you can't do.

The reason is that it creates an adversarial atmosphere where the people have to pick sides, **and they don't like to pick sides, they would rather have everyone be happy**. So when you have to pick sides, what do you do? You either butt out, you just leave it alone, you run away.

These are your words, not ours - and hopefully reflects a better understanding of what's not acceptable.\n\n> I just want to clearly understand the rationale of of why anti-CCP images are OK, but anti-Nazi ones aren't, so I can follow your rules correctly and save everyone's time in the future by correctly deciding which images are OK or not.\n\nWe never said that. We gave specific examples of objectionable content. If you realise something isn't suitable - that it is something shocking, and not suitable for the workplace, as you seem to realise, it shouldn't be on your profile.\n\nIn short, we believe you have a very clear idea, from your own response, of what's not acceptable, and we hope you exercise better judgement in this regard in future.\n____\n\nCiro's Reply:\n\n____\n> We never said that. We gave specific examples of objectionable content. If you realise something isn't suitable - that it is something shocking, and not suitable for the workplace, as you seem to realise, it shouldn't be on your profile.\n\nMy intent is to convey extremely important information, not to shock.\n\nHowever, in dictatorships like China, extremely important information is forbidden for unfair reasons, and therefore shocking.\n\n> We never said that. We gave specific examples of objectionable content. If you realise something isn't suitable - that it is something shocking, and not suitable for the workplace, as you seem to realise, it shouldn't be on your profile.\n\nYou forbade any Nazi imagery clearly, including to criticize the Nazis, so that is clear and I will never again add Nazi imagery.\n\nAll anti-CCP content is extremely shocking to many Chinese people (but not others). And it is not suitable for the workplace for anyone there, that is unquestionable.\n\nTherefore, from your reply, I understand that anti-CCP content is not allowed because it is not suitable for the workplace in China, as it is shocking.\n\nIs this understand correct? Can you please confirm very clearly and directly: do you forbid all anti-CCP imagery or not?

But that content made by other users was still removed. Therefore, this is not just a simple user ban, but active censorship.\n\nCiro received an email from account@mail.zhihu.com:\n\n____\n您好，Ciro Santilli，很抱歉您的回答受到了牵连，您回答过的问题「github.com@cirosantilli 是谁维护的，为什么会收集邮箱地址？」因「违反互联网相关法律法规」已被删除。\n____\n\nfollowed by Ciro's answer to <<zhihu-46957710>>. Ciro could not login anymore, the login screen showed:\n\n____\n帐号已停用，请联系：user@zhihu.com\n____\n\nSo likely someone must have used the fact that this was an edgy personally information release subject issue, and then someone from Zhihu decided to purge Ciro and anyone posts that ever talked about him.\n\nCiro's blocked account:\n\n* before deletion: https://web.archive.org/web/20190821075907/https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities\n* after deletion (redirects to login page): https://web.archive.org/web/20191103071033/https://www.zhihu.com/signin?next=http://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities\n\nRandom unblocked control account: https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities (https://web.archive.org/web/20191103070652/https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities[archive]).\n\nFurthermore, all questions related to Ciro, including the posts criticizing him such as https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25600138[] (https://archive.is/DkooN[archive]), were taken down. This made Ciro laugh: in China, you can't even criticize that which is censored, or your post also gets taken down.\n\nCiro then created an anonymous Zhihu account after this event.\n\nInterestingly however, the following answer came up later on: <<zhihu-ted-chiang-answer>> and stayed up for at least 5 months, which indicates that Zhihu did a one-off removal, and did not set up a filter for Ciro's name.\n\n====== Ciro Santilli's Zhihu ban 2018-06-25\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> was banned from Zhihu on 2018-06-25 for \"<<politically-sensitive>>\" content.\n\nAs a result, since that time I will be answering Zhihu questions as issues in this repo with the `zhihu` label: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Azhihu+\n\nI have however never posted anything politically sensitive on Zhihu, unless my name and profile picture have reached that distinction, and therefore the ban is clearly an unfair per-person ban.\n\nBut of course, all is fair in love and war, and politics.\n\nPosting any sensitive content on Chinese websites is a waste of time, since it only means that they will be removed and you will waste time creating a new account, I will never do that.\n\nThe only significant content I ever posted on Zhihu is the answer to: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710/answer/122827944 which is purely technical, and trivial replies on threads that other people have started about me. Have those people been blocked like me?\n\nMy posts are still up and it does not appear to be possible for people to see that I have been banned, but whenever I try to take any action on the website a popup appears saying:\n\n____\n由于严重违反 知乎社区管理规定 ，该帐号已被永久禁言\n____\n\nThis includes liking, commenting, answering, asking or trying to update my profile to say that I have been blocked.\n\nThis message also shows on my public page for everyone to see: https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities but they use some JavaScript scheme complicated enough that archive.is cannot capture it.\n\nI still get notifications however, but I am unable to reply to them, especially given that all Chinese accounts, unlike mine, have no personal identifiable information due to the understandable fear Chinese citizens have of their own government, even though such accounts might be illegal in theory: <<anonymous-accounts-ban>>.\n\nThe only action that I can take now is to report abusive comments people make to me.\n\nObviously, the only effect of such ban is that I will create an <<anonymous-accounts-ban,anonymous account>> under Tor with a second cell phone if I wish to contribute in the future, and China will have less information about my political interests than before.\n\nThe private messages the website sends while banning you are:\n\n____\n知乎管理员 ：您好，根据用户举报，您的帐号发布了「<<politically-sensitive,政治敏感>>」内容，帐号已根据知乎社区规范被永久禁言。处理详情可查看社区服务中心。具体规范请查看知乎社区管理规定。 6月25日 16:37 回复 | 删除\n\n知乎管理员 ：您好，根据用户举报，您的部分个人信息由于不符合知乎用户信息管理规范已被重置。用户名可以在设置页面中修改，修改后会自动进入审核等待通过；其他个人信息可以在个人主页中编辑。感谢您对知乎社区的理解和支持。 6月25日 16:37 回复 | 删除\n____\n\nThose messages contain links to: https://www.zhihu.com/terms2 | https://archive.is/wdXSz and https://www.zhihu.com/question/19551824 | https://archive.is/BrgV2\n\nThe ban came soon after I posted a link to my GitHub repo as a comment at: https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/ice-employee-list-github-linkedin/ maybe they are related.\n\n====== Who reported Ciro Santilli on Zhihu\n\nAt the same time the ban happened I received a public comment from user \"Eureka\" https://www.zhihu.com/people/crb912/activities | https://archive.is/1F3t6 on this thread: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710 | https://archive.is/PVOLd saying:\n\n____\n你滥用了github， 也滥用了Stackover。这个一个纯粹计算机、编程和知识分享的地方，请不要带入政治性的色彩。请不要这么做， 维护社区的非政治性、中立和技术性纯粹，是每个热爱cs的人应尽的义务。\n____\n\nI am unable to get a URL that shows the comment on archive.is, so I have no proof of this claim. If you trust me, then here is a screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/YCiEEax\n\nSince I expect the ban lists to be private, I find it extremely likely that this was the user who reported me, unless both were simultaneously triggered by a third event which I have not seen. So correct me if I'm wrong here.\n\nUsers with the same user id `crb912`, related \"Eureka\" username or same profile picture, can be found at:\n\n* https://www.weibo.com/crb912 (unable to archive) on <<weibo>>\n* https://github.com/crb912 | https://archive.is/heGfd which suggests a possible real name\n\nBy Googling the email found on the GitHub repos, we find: http://www.360doc.com/content/15/0809/11/25724933_490492490.shtml | https://archive.is/2UnGL which might, at last, contain a photo of my nemesis.\n\nMy public message to the reporter whomever he may be:\n\n____\nWhile you have also raised issues that were raised a thousand times before, and clearly answered in the FAQ, at least you were able to take some actual action leading to an actual ban, and I respect you for that.\n\nI hope that one day you will redirect that cunning and initiative towards taking down the root cause of the problem, which are the Chinese communist Party and their Firewall themselves.\n____\n\n===== Zhihu questions related to Ciro Santilli\n\nParent section: <<backlinks>>\n\nAll Zhihu posts related to Ciro Santilli were deleted following <<zhihu-purge>>.

Justification: \"non-English\".\n+\n* 2017 created one in English: Cook <<tiananmen,Tiananmen Square>> Noodle Shop, from <<falun-sweden>>\n+\nAdded my Noodle shop to maps: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tiananmen+Square+Noodle+Shop/@60.6132538,15.6687509,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x94603408e3c63fb3!8m2!3d60.6132538!4d15.6687509\n+\nLeach websites that picked it up: https://kvalster.se/Falu/Uthyres/Lagenheter/Gammelvagen_49_1417351\n\nQuora is also shitty because wumaos can downvote your answer privately regardless of reputation and make it become collapsed as \"Answer may need improvement\", which means it goes to the bottom and readers have to click an \"expand collapsed answers\" button to see it, so that very few people will ever see it.\n\nThen have to appeal and wait for moderators to evaluate it.\n\nThis happened for example at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli (see also <<t-shirt>>).\n\nCiro appealed in 2020-03-10 and the answer was reinstated on day later, but by then the question was already not being suggested as much to readers, and the other wumao answers (which criticize the USA rather than answering the question about China).\n\nWhile there is some probability that the answers themselves are not wumaos, their upvoters almost certainly are and must be investigated.\n\nOther shitty aspects of Quora include:\n\n* block <<wayback-machine>> archives with their robots.txt, gotta use <<archive-today>>\n* automatically add random topics that you don't care about to your suggestions, with no easy way to prevent that.\n* questions cannot have more than one sentence. There used to be a question body, but it was replaced with a \"link for context\". Ridiculous.\n\nAs a result, on the few occasions that Ciro posts on Quora, all content will also be mirrored here. Ciro's China Quora answers include:\n\n* https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli[What would happen if I walked around Beijing with a t-shirt that said \"freedom of speech is pretty great\"?] (https://archive.is/PxjJA[archive]) see also: <<t-shirt>>\n* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-net-worth-of-Xi-Jinping/answer/Ciro-Santilli[What is the net worth of Xi Jinping?] see also: <<panama-papers>>\n\nSome <<wumao,wumaos>>:\n\n* http://archive.is/WzIcg[]: a Han supremacist!\n\nRelated posts:\n\n* on <<reddit>>\n** 2021-03 https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/lv0n24/has_quora_been_overrun_with_chinese_propaganda/\n*** 2021-04 https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/mkfgrb/quora_is_officially_a_propaganda_network_for_the/\n\n[[ptt]]\n==== PTT Bulletin Board System 批踢踢實業坊\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTT_Bulletin_Board_System\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/批踢踢\n\nPopular <<taiwan,Taiwanese>> forum system and server from 1995, pre HTML, works from telnet terminal, so likely very programmer heavy, and obviously anti-CCP, as of 2020 often shows <<falun-gong>> ads.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>>'s appearances on PTT:\n\n* 2020-10-09: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602211516.A.3FB.html 如何一秒惹怒中國人 (how to provoke a Chinese person in one second) by https://pttweb.tw/user/abc60575986/[abc60575986] saying \"台灣是一個國家\" (Taiwan is a country).

Therefore all people end up thinking that the government is good.\n* just like China, <<evil-west,they emphasize the threat of the foreign countries>>, especially the US, as a justification for having an oppressive power.\n* the government puts pressure on any significant opposition candidate. One technique is to find some reason to put them in jail for two months, which by Russian law forbids them from participating in further elections. Only candidates that don't really stand a chance are left as a fake opposition.

The only other choice would have been joining the CCP.\n\nTo Ciro it is obvious that Falun Gong is just one of the many very similar movements that came out of the Qi Gong Boom, such as: <<zhong-gong>>. It just happens to be the one that survived due to better luck and strategy.\n\nThe absolute truth is already known by the <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>, although he does not want to give clear evidence for reasons: <<flg-verifiable>>, and Ciro finds that utterly boring. There's no fun in living in a world where the absolute truth has been found.\n\nFor these reasons, Ciro cannot bother to read even into the self-help part: how can you read that when there is so much bullshit every other page?\n\nCiro would really like to know if <<li-hongzhi>> really believes in FLG himself, or is just a complete manipulating charlatan, but unfortunately we will never know that. Just imagine if before he died he published a video saying: \"it was a joke, gotcha!\". Now that would be **epic**!\n\nSince Ciro is good-natured, it's hard for him to believe that he doesn't believe in anything, how can anyone be that evil? Maybe he believes in part of it, but made up some stuff to sell it better, maybe with good intentions that selling the fake part would also lead more people to see the good part?\n\nLike any other prophetic religion, FLG gives tiny evidence that you can directly feel through meditation. The energies, which Ciro believe are real feelings. And then using that entry point asks you to believe a whole lot more, that you can't feel: <<flg-verifiable>>.\n\nThis becomes especially strong when a critical mass of believers is reached, and then they start interpreting all sorts of events as miracles, and you start to believe other believers without questioning them, and a circle is formed.\n\nThis post by a former believer gives what Ciro feels is a realistic account that matches Ciro's observations: <<me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-2017>>.\n\nAnd yet, all those who love freedom, must oppose FLG ban, or be themselves enslaved by tyrants themselves: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.\n\nIn any case, at least FLG got one thing right: the commies are <<ccp-evil,evil>>, and we have to get rid of them.\n\nSee also: <<flg-fake>>.\n\n[[how-much-does-ciro-santilli-know-about-falun-gong]]\n==== How much does Ciro Santilli know about Falun Gong?

Non believers call them derogatorily \"轮子\"(\"little wheels\"), or in friendly terms \"轮友\" (wheel friend).\n\nAnd if you say you don't believe in their FLG metaphysics bullshit, they will often reply \"he does not understand\".\n\nTo them, it is not about belief, the truth is clear, and you just don't see it yet.\n\nTo this you should reply: \"and you don't understand that <<li-hongzhi,Li Hongzhi>> is a master manipulator dude who deceived you and millions of others\".\n\nBut <<ciro-santilli>> strongly believes that this is just a language barrier/FLG propaganda question (see also \"Different levels of truth\" from <<orange-papers>>), and that 99.9999% of people in the West would classify FLG as a religion just like <<christianity>> if they are told about FLG's beliefs:\n\n* absolute truth comes from an enlightened <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>, who is perfect and has superhuman abilities\n* weekly in-person meetings (学法 \"study the Fa\", or more verbosely \"study the law (of the universe (of <<li-hongzhi>>))\"）or daily online meetings where they read from a <<flg-canon,sacred book>>, either written by the prophet, or transcribed from his presentations to disciples, including the disciples questions, much like traditional Chinese texts like <<analects>>, just like Christians read from the Bible over and over again.\n+\nIn both cases, some believers claim that sometimes even reading the same text again gives them new insight.\n* prescribed daily meditation exercise hours, somewhat like Muslim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah[Salah] prayers which they call https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazhengnian[发正念 (fa1 zheng4 nian4)], which means \"send righteous thoughts\".

It is called Total Recall. Now there are six supernormal capabilities which are generally recognized in the world. They include the Celestial Eye, Remote Sight, and Total Recall. What is Total Recall? It is a supernormal capability with which one can know a person's future and past; if the ability is great, one can know the rise and decline of a society; if the ability is even greater, one can see the Law of the change of the whole celestial body.\n____\n* aliens that look like humans are amongst us, they gave us part of our modern technology, some are evil, others not so evil.

But I tell you that precisely because of its shallowness, this science has caused the degeneration of morality in human society.\n____\n+\nDespite this however, Falun Gong benefits from information technology enormously. For example, many (most?) believers use the Internet daily to study the Fa, and to organize their <<falun-gong-media,media outlets>>.\n* meetings in which people tell their religious testimonies (\"experience sharing\" TODO Chinese name, possibly just \"分享修炼的美好\", e.g. https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2015/9/29/分享修炼的美好-印尼召开修炼心得交流会（图）-316838.html[source]): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony#Religion\n+\nAs Jesus put it in https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A20&version=NIV[Matthew 18:20]:\n+\n____\nFor where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them\n____\n+\nwhich highlights the critical believer mass effect of reinforced beliefs.\n* an impending link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment[final judgment]-like event, which will happen \"very soon\" (<<flg-verifiable,unspecified date>>), and in which the just will be rewarded\n+\nCiro predict that when <<li-hongzhi>> dies, the claim will be that he went to another dimension so save us all, therefore putting this final judgment on hold, a bit like Jesus.\n* non-believers are fundamentally different from believers.

How could there possibly have been human beings 260 million years ago according to Darwin's theory of evolution?\n____\n* xref:flg-medication[Maybe FLG will make you healthier, but no promises, but it will make you a better person, and that's why you should do it, but if you really really believe, you get healthier]. But people who seemed to be believers also die, because deep within their hearts, there was a belief problem.\n* <<falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils>>\n\nFrom this, it is obvious that Falun Gong is just a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age[New Age] (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新纪元运动[新纪元运动]) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism[syncretic] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/綜攝[综摄]) religion combining https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong[Qigong], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism[Buddhism], some aspects of <<christianity>>, and whatever other crazy things <<li-hongzhi>> believes in.\n\nOr you could call Falun Gong a <<flg-cult,cult>>, which is nothing but a new/small religion with negative connotation, and thus meaningless.\n\nFLG is very similar to Scientology in Ciro's view: a new religion that mixes elements of both old and new. And just like any other religion, <<democracy-is-a-religion,their practice must be allowed>>.\n\nBut consider this: how to classify what a religion is?\n\nSome would answer: science is what every one can perceive with their own senses.\n\nBut FLG followers claim to feel FLG energies when doing the exercises, and a few of them have the power of seeing the other dimensions.\n\nOn the other hand, how many of your friends have experienced the laws of quantum field theory or general relativity in a very direct way?\n\nAnd aren't pro-democracy believers also taking actions based solely on a shared belief, possibly organized by a pro-democracy leader?\n\nFrom a purely strategic point of view, the \"religion\" denomination would be:\n\n* good to FLG because the concept of freedom of religion carries considerable weight in the West\n* bad for FLG because people who already have a religion would be less likely to try it out and start believing\n+\nFalun Gong's recruitment strategy is to focus on the exercises first, and in particular its <<flg-medication,health benefits>> and then as some people start to feel things, they start introducing the metaphysics.\n\nSee also: \"Different levels of truth\" from <<orange-papers>>.\n\nSee also: <<flg-daily>>.\n\n==== Falun Gong believes that the CCP is literally a manifestation of real devils\n\nUnlike <<ciro-santilli>> which does <<is-chinese-politician-x-evil,not think most CCP politicians are actually evil>>, Falun Gong seems to believe that they literally as in they are representatives of, or evil supernatural beings themselves.\n\nE.g. <<jiang-zemin>> is actually an evil frog in some alternate dimension, literally, not just memecally.\n\nAnd those devils they are literally responsible for example for creating <<covid,Covid-19>>, which is itself a magic force which tests the evil and good: <<falun-gongs-view-of-epidemics>>.\n\nAnd <<flg-trump,Trump>> likely represents a magical anti-devil force of the universe.\n\nSome of the most direct <<flg-canon,canon>> suggestions we could find: https://en.falundafa.org/eng/HongYin5.htm[]:\n\n____\nThe Red Devil uses lies and money to meddle with man\n____\n\nhttps://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20060209A.html[]:\n\n____\nAll along, lowlife secret agents of the wicked CCP have been constantly gathering so-called \"Falun Gong intelligence.\"\n____\n\nFalun Gong gives the CCP too much credit. The CCP are just a bunch of lazy and greedy people like you and me.\n\n==== Falun Gong preaching\n\nlink:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-air_preaching[Street preaching] is an important aspect of Falun Gong, using stands and leaflets on the streets much like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses[Jehovah's Witnesses].\n\nJargon:\n\n* http://www.minghui.org/mh/glossary.html[讲真相]: \"truth-telling\"\n* hongfa (TODO characters?)\n\nThe Falun Gong organization also specifies guidelines on how to preach, although these might not be <<flg-canon,canon>>, even though if they are not, it is extremely likely that <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> is directly involved in their specification\n\nFalun Gong has also used <<flg-telemarketing,phone call preaching>>.\n\nAll of this is part of their effort to \"save people (救人)\", i.e. convert them to Falun Gong.\n\n<<li-hongzhi>> personally heavily emphasises the importance of preaching in <<flg-canon>>.\n\n.Falun Gong believers preaching on the street in London in 2016. This image taken from a believer website shows a typical local regular gathering of believers on weekends, or even week days if there are enough retired believers in the group. They will put on their exercise music, and do exercises to attract more followers. Someone will also stand on their stall giving out propaganda flyers, or asking people to sign petitions for Western governments to support Falun Gong, e.g. opposing their alleged <<flg-organ-harvesting,organ harvesting>>. In the case of touristic areas with Chinese people walking around, they will also ask the Chinese tourists to <<tuidang,quit the their CCP membership, possibly using a fake name>>. <<ciro-santilli>> has to say: it is very amusing to see those Chinese people trying to pretend to ignore the censored religion, when some of them are clearly curious about it, especially the younger ones who didn't see it live. Some just get mad, and say how the CCP is so great to them. https://truthinchina.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/london-uk-practitioners-explain-the-facts-about-falun-gong-in-st-martins-place-photos/[Source].\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Falun_Gong_street_preaching_2016_London.jpg[height=400]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=315&v=nD6792YoOmY from <<nigel-ng,Mikey Chen>> shows a parade/preaching event in San Francisco.\n\n[[flg-telemarketing]]\n===== Some Falun Gong people make phone telemarketing\n\nCiro Santilli has seen Falun Gong people making phone calls to people in China with to explain why FLG is with his own eyes, and therefore is sure it has happened on some scale.\n\nParticularly during <<covid>>, Falun Gong ramped up the telemarketing calls and some voluntary believers were making calls all day nonstop.\n\nCiro does not know how the called numbers were obtained and if callees voluntarily signed up for it, but that feels extremely unlikely.\n\nInterestingly however, many of the callees seemed interesting in what they had to say, and they often had long chats, Ciro was surprised by that. Maybe they were just bored senseless due to the Corona lockdown. Or maybe <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,many Chinese People actually don't like their Government>> and the CCP is fucked.\n\nAlso, of course, the callers received call scripts and guidelines to makes those calls, because obviously <<flg-organized>>.\n\nCiro strongly disapproves of this, Just like for any product, visual ads on the street are impossible to prevent, but any kind of advertising that generates notifications on feeds, or takes people's time, is unacceptable.\n\nAs you can easily find on <<google>>/<<baidu>>, such calls may be reported in the <<cac-report-website>>.\n\nCiro has not however seen them talking about making automated phone calls.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1940394/how-rampant-phone-scams-highlight-chinas-need-tighter also mentions that Falun Gong makes telemarketing in passing without any reference.\n\n[[flg-cult]]\n==== Is Falun Gong a cult? 法轮功是邪教吗？\n\nDoes <<ciro-santilli>> think Falun Gong a cult? Yes.\n\nIs the CCP a cult? Yes: <<ccp-cult>>.\n\nIs <<christianity>> a cult? Yes.\n\nIs democracy a cult? Yes: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.\n\nIs modern science a cult? Maybe.\n\nTherefore, the only question that matters for all the above is the same: are they good or bad cults?\n\nFalun Gong clearly share many many many characteristics with what many people classify as a \"cult\", see e.g.: <<orange-papers>>.\n\nHowever, <<ciro-santilli>> strongly believes that so does any other existing religion e.g. Christianity, and that Falun Gong is not any worse or better than those other well known religions.\n\nCiro therefore believes that the only reasonable stances are to either:\n\n* be against all religions (including Christianity and Falun Gong), and classify all of them as Cults\n* allow both Christianity and Falun Gong to exist, and support religious freedom\n\nbut not \"oppose Falun Gong\" and support Christianity.\n\nSome people will say: Falun Gong is a cult because it is too new and therefore obviously fake!\n\nSo, if I tell a lie today, will it become true in a thousand years? Or a truth today become a lie? The Romans called <<christianity>> the \"Cult of Jesus\"!\n\nTry sending an email to <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> asking him to <<flg-verifiable,prove his powers to you>> :-)\n\nOthers will say: Falun Gong is a cult because its prophet is still alive!\n\nBut then, worry not, because Li Hongzhi was born in 1951, and therefore will almost certainly die by 2040, unless he truly is a living God as he claims.\n\nNow, for the really important question of weather Falun Gong is a \"good\" or \"bad\" religion, <<ciro-santilli>> has seen absolutely nothing in it that is worse than any <<flg-religion,other major religion>> say, e.g., <<christianity>>.\n\nSome possibly neutral Cult analysts analyzing if FLG is good or bad:\n\n* https://www.icsahome.com/articles/the-prc-and-falun-gong-langone\n\nAgainst:\n\n* https://www.culteducation.com/group/1254-falun-gong.html\n\nIn the end however, since there is nothing obviously completely creepy about FLG, all such discussions are basically equivalent to <<democracy-is-a-religion,\"is the Left better than the Right\">>, and cannot be answered.\n\nOne interesting linguistic aspect is that \"cult\" normally translates in Chinese as \"邪教\" which means \"Evil religion\".\n\nAs mentioned before, Ciro does not believe that FLG is an \"Evil Cult\", just another \"Acceptable Cult\", and therefore would not use \"邪教\" to describe it.\n\nAmusingly, <<li-hongzhi,Li>> calls the communists Communist Evil Party (中共邪党) in cannon, well played: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa5_2.htm\n\nThe word \"Cult\" is much more ambiguous in English however, and does not necessarily imply \"Evil\" in certain contexts, just \"worship\".\n\nFor example, People from <<ciro-santilli>>'s mother's Protestant Church in Brazil, all say that they are going \"to the cult\" when referring to when they are going to church to pray, sing and read the Bible together.\n\nAnd obviously, the origin of the word \"cult\" is exactly the same as that of https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cultivate#Etymology[\"cultivate\"] as in \"cultivate the crops\" (which is also how Falun Gong believers refer to practicing Falun Gong: \"cultivation practice\"). All of those come from the https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cult#Etymology[Latin \"colō\"], which means simply \"to protect\".\n\n[[ccp-cult]]\n===== CCP cult (中共邪教)\n\nThe CCP also has many cult-like characteristics, notably <<xi-jinping,\"The Guru is always right\">>, which is mentioned on <<orange-papers>> itself under \"The Guru is always right.\" (highlight by <<ciro-santilli,Ciro>>):\n\n____\nThe Guru, his church, and his teachings are always right, and above criticism, and beyond reproach.\n\nIn some cults, the guru is dead, but the principle is the same. I use the word \"guru\" loosely here; in many cults the charismatic leader has the title of minister, priest, yogi, swami, prophet, or all-knowing wise man. **Or even, \"<<mao-zedong,Chairman Mao>>.\"** In any case, the leader is always right.\n____\n\nAnd they also claim that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous[Alcoholics Anonymous] could be characterized as a cult. Very cool. What else could be powerful enough to get you off a physical addiction, than a mental addiction, right?\n\n____\n<<mao-zedong,Mao>> is the Father +\n<<xi-jinping,Xi>> is the Son +\nThe CCP is the Holy Spirit\n____\n\nBoth Mao and Xi have produced their own sacred books which must be revered, much like <<li-hongzhi>>'s <<flg-canon>>:\n\n* Xi's: <<xi-jinping-thought>>\n* Mao's: <<little-red-book>>\n\nFurthermore, both of those books are based on speeches, just like just like Li Hongzhi's speeches become instant canon.\n\nThis devotion can also be seen in Xi's benevolent personification: <<xi-dada>>.\n\nThis is also observed by <<falun-gong>> itself as a response to the CCP <<flg-cult,accusing Falun Gong of being an Evil Cult>>. E.g.: https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2019/07/01/a102612683.html from <<ntdtv>>, and Falun Gong is completely right here.\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<democracy-is-a-religion>>\n\n[[xi-halo]]\n.Xi Jinping with a Halo edited in to make <<ccp-cult,the obvious more obvious>>.

Copyright says by \"A. Orange\". Is it the real name, or just a pun for \"I ate an orange\"?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Orangepapers/comments/5sh7kg/any_info_on_what_happened_to_the_orange_papers/ mentions the creator's first name is \"Terry\", and that the website went down due to financial trouble.\n\nClaimed interview with him on the 2013 SAFE RECOVERY podcast: https://podfanatic.com/podcast/safe-recovery/episode/orange-papers-founder-terry-talks-about-the-truth-about-aa-1\n\nThe website also offered compressed archives, but Ciro could not find any of those on the Wayback Machine, although it is hard to be sure because there are many different timestamps available, the section reads:\n\n____\nGet this entire web site in a set of compressed packages so that you can read it later offline (and burn CDs and give copies to friends).\n\nArchives are available in both Unix/Linux tarred-gzipped format, or Micro$uck Windoze winzip format.\n\nCurrent as of 2016-12-07 (yyyy-mm-dd).\n\nTotal Size = 900 MB compressed (1.7 GB uncompressed), but no file is larger than 14 MB, to prevent file size problems with some systems, like Comcast.\n\nGet either set; you don't need both, as the files contained are identical.\n____\n\nFile names are of form:\n\n* `Orange_Papers-alpha-2016-12-07.tar.gz`\n* `Orange_Papers-imgs000-2011-01-01.tar.gz`\n\nA mirror with many broken links and images: http://aorange1.tripod.com/\n\nAnd the website also has a Free Tibet flag at the bottom.\n\nMany of the points highlighted at are very very interesting and Ciro feels that they apply strongly to <<falun-gong>>:\n\n* \"Instant Community\" and \"Instant intimacy\": you instantly join the cult family, and are very very likely to believe or at least consider anything anyone else in the cult says about their religious experiences, no matter how far-fetched, even though it is not <<flg-canon,canon>>\n+\nConversely, this also poses a risk for the Cult Leader, as new community ideas can spread very quickly, and if you try to fight them off, they might create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism[Schism].\n* \"Cult-speak\": see also \"Newspeak\" from <<nineteen-eighty-four>> and some common Falun Gong Cult-speak see: <<flg-religion>>\n* \"Denigration of competing sects, cults, religions, groups, or organizations\": yes, <<li-hongzhi>> does this all the time, see: <<zhong-gong>>\n* \"Personal testimonies of earlier converts\": see \"experience sharing\" at <<flg-religion>>\n* \"The group and its members are special\", \"Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider\": see: \"ordinary people (常人)\" at <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>>\n* \"Making cult members work long hours for free\": yes, many FLG members work long long hours for free. Why wouldn't you if you are saving people's souls?\n* \"No Humor\": see also <<funny>>\n* \"Different Levels of Truth\", \"Deceptive Recruiting\": Falun Gong people don't talk freely about their funny beliefs like <<flg-religion,aliens are amongst us>> to outsiders. Rather, they lure you in with the exercises first. Ciro has personally heard the following said many times: \"you should not tell this to non-believers, they are not ready for this truth yet\".\n* \"Front groups, masquerading recruiters, hidden promoters, and disguised propagandists\": <<falun-gong-media>>\n* \"Promised Powers or Knowledge\" and \"It's a con. You don't get the promised goodies\": they seem to believe in a <<flg-religion,Judgement Day like event>> and <<flg-medication,health benefits>>\n* \"The Guru is always right\", \"You are always wrong\", \"No Graduates\", \"The Guru Is Extra-Special\", \"Everybody else needs the guru to boss him around, but nobody bosses the guru around\", \"The guru criticizes everybody else, but nobody criticizes the guru.\": obviously: <<li-hongzhi>>\n** \"Group-think, Suppression of Dissent, and Enforced Conformity in Thinking\"\n* Membership Rivalry. Members vie with one another for the guru's attention, and for status within the group. Everyone is trying to become part of the favored inner circle. The leader plays the members off against each other in order to maintain his hold over the cult.\n* Giggly wonderfulness and starry-eyed faith: <<flg-religion,notably visible during in experience sharing>>\n\nThere are also however some points which Ciro feels don't apply, and Ciro praises Falun Gong for those:\n\n* \"Dual Purposes\": not much of that, most of their propaganda is \"we are persecuted unfairly by China\", not \"let's help the poor\"\n* \"The End Justifies The Means\": Li has made it clear that believers must follow the laws of their countries. Cults that violate this tend to not last as long, this is the smart move for cult leaders.\n\nAnd some points which Ciro feels apply which were mentioned in some other article, (or maybe in Orange Papers but he couldn't find them, TODO find reference?)\n\n* \"No time for fun\": how could you possibly spend leisure time watching television, etc. when you could be saving the world instead?\n* \"Focus on the persecution of the Cult\": while obviously people who have been persecuted have the right, and almost an obligation, to look for help and share their stories, it is also clear that this is a selling point for the Cult.\n+\nWhy would a nation state attack a Cult? This could give the impression that it is because there is something powerful and true in the Cult, and actually menaces this nation state.\n+\nFor example, Falun Gong puts huge emphasis on its persecution in China, much like the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr[Martyrdom] of the Catholic Saints is highly emphasised.\n\nThis is especially interesting, because the website does not mention Falun Gong at all it seems: it really seems that all those cults are very similar.\n\nIt should also be mentioned though that these points extend to any type of human organization, e.g. <<flg-religion,other religions>>, <<democracy-is-a-religion,political parties>>, job associations, etc.\n\n====== Careful control of your image\n\nThe cult leader is a master at controlling how people view him.\n\nOne aspect of that, is after reaching a certain critical mass of mindless followers, to limit your public appearances to situations in which you have the most control, and notably being surrounded only by your believers.\n\nBecause of course: you are human, not a God, and you are going to fuck up from time to time, so why take any risks?\n\n<<li-hongzhi>> does not announce where he is going for the most part, even though he is followed by millions: he just shows up unannounced, and local believers whisper to one another in short advance and come to see him when possible.\n\nThis reminded Ciro of the <<vissarion>> video he watched, in which VICE was allowed to visit and interview <<russia,Siberian>> prophet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vissarion[Vissarion] (real name Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop Серге́й Анато́льевич То́роп, AKA \"The Russian Jesus\"), and they note how well he controlled his appearance.\n\n[[vissarion]]\n.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Cv5hZfOmk&t=1177\nvideo::W2Cv5hZfOmk[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=1177]\n\n[[flg-canon]]\n=== What are the canonical Falun Gong texts?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong\n\nIt appears that Falun Gong cannon is present at: https://falundafa.org/\n\nThe two main books are:\n\n* \"China Falun Gong\" (中国法轮功) AKA just \"Falun Gong\" published in April 1993. 2006 English translation https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006.htm[]. Wikipedia comments:\n+\n____\nFalun Gong is an introductory book that discusses qigong, introduces the principles of the practice, and provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises.\n____\n+\nThe first edition contains one of http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130###\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong#Zhuan_Falun,_the_main_book[Zhuan Falun] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/转法轮_(书)[转法轮]), published in January 1995. 1998 English version: https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_01.htm[]:\n+\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n+\n____\nZhuan Falun is the main teaching and the most comprehensive work; it is an edited version of Li's nine-lecture series, 54 of which he taught across China between 1992 and 1994.\n____\n+\nBelievers very often read from this text when they <<flg-religion,\"study the Fa\">> in their gatherings. They often read one chapter per session, and can often just say \"we read the Nth teaching\" (第N讲, so apparently each chapter corresponds to a separate talk). Just like <<xi-jinping-thought>>!\n\nThe initial versions of both of those texts contained versions of <<li-hongzhis-hagiography>>.\n\nIt contains <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>'s approved texts/speech transcriptions, which are sacred.\n\nThe only sacred version is Chinese which is a sacred language, and of which there is only one perfect revision. Islam also appears to place great importance on the sacredness of Arabic in which Mohamed first spoke, perhaps even more: https://nationalinterest.org/feature/plight-uyghurs-why-muslims-wont-speak-their-brethren-112466 Protestants and later the Catholic church, have moved away from such really bad strategy however, the accessibility of Christianity is seen on the entrance of many many churches which have a sign \"ALL are welcome\". Well played.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> heard <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> claims the specifically chose to reincarnate in China this last time.\n\nThe English translation is made by followers, and gets new revisions to reduce translation imperfections.\n\nHowever, the Chinese language seems to be fundamentally sacred, and there might never be a sacred English version approved by LHZ.\n\nLHZ is of course a de-facto God with superpowers, and can of course speak all languages, but https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=for%20reasons[for reasons] he didn't just write an English translation himself.\n\nThis is a reasonable command to download the English cannon for grepping:\n\n....\nwget -r -l inf --no-remove-listing --no-clobber --no-parent -w 2 https://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-books.html\n....\n\nTODO: need to find a way to wrap lines, otherwise grep might fail on sentences.\n\nBut funnily the Canon books appear to all be copyrighted, likely \"to avoid other people from modifying his sacred text\", which is funny since the dude's the voice of absolute truth of the universe, but you still gotta copyright that I guess.\n\nNothing else is canonical. LHZ seems to have said that there are enlightened followers, but has not specified who, so we can't derive canon from anyone else.\n\nNotably, <<flg-organized,FLG media>> such as https://www.minghui.org/ is believer led and thus not canonical, even though believers have very high confidence in it, and LHZ <<flg-organized,directly supports it>>.\n\nCCP <<ccp-cult,cult leaders>> such as <<xi-jinping>> and <<mao-zedong>> have also published their own canon books, e.g.:\n\n* Xi's: <<xi-jinping-thought>>\n* Mao's: <<little-red-book>>\n\n.Front and back cover of <<flg-canon,Zhuan Falun>>, first edition (1994). It is said amongst believers that <<flg-verifiable,the Lotus flower on the back of these books have magically opened progressively as time passed>>. http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=165###[Source].\nimage::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Zhuan_Falun.jpg[height=400]\n\n=== Does Ciro Santilli support FLG, or just use it because it is censored?\n\nCiro Santilli doesn't support FLG specifically, only freedom of religion. See of course: <<flg-bias>>.\n\nCiro uses it in his usernames simply because it is the most banned and censored one in China today.\n\nHe believe that <<flg-thoughtcrime,individuals should only be put in jail for what they do, not for what they believe>>.\n\nHe considers FLG <<flg-religion,a religion like any other>>, and he is against its ban, as that of all other religions.\n\nHe also believes that freedom of speech and democracy imply that FLG and other religions will exist. If you want freedom, you have to <<intolerance,accept other people's choices>>.\n\nOtherwise, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy and communism can also be considered as religions>>, and banned.\n\nSee also: <<flg-verifiable>>.\n\n[[flg-daily]]\n=== How is it like to live with Falun Gong believers?\n\nThis will obviously vary from believer to believer, but here is <<ciro-santilli>>'s experience.\n\nLike any other religion that is taken seriously, they spend several hours per week doing their standard religious activities: <<flg-religion>>.\n\nCiro has never seen them, or anyone we know from FLG say or do something that he consider morally incorrect because of FLG.\n\nThis does not prevent <<wife,his wife>> from working normally.\n\nCiro's mother-in-law, who is retired, dedicates all her time to Falun Gong when she is not taking care of the house.\n\nCiro's mother is also religious (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism[Protestant]), and he gets a very similar feeling about both groups.\n\nLike other religions, Falun Gong gives them meaning in life, and Ciro admires that they pursue their belief energetically, just as he persues his beliefs energetically.\n\nCiro much prefers that Ciro's mother-in-law does Falun Gong, which is a noble meaningful goal, rather than watch stupid crap on television.\n\nAlso, although he is <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>>, Ciro also lives in a similar way.\n\nCiro's religion is that of science and technology, and he pursue it fervently by trying to learn and teach it and spend several hours a week doing that, even when it does not give him money immediately.\n\nIf Ciro pursue his meaning, why should he prevent anyone from pursuing theirs?\n\nPreviously, Ciro's wife and mother-in-law would sometimes try to persuade him to learn Falun Gong, which was annoying.\n\nBut every time he told them very clearly that he knows where to download the books if I want to, and that he may never want to read them, and that his wife must either accept this fact or leave him.\n\nAnd they have accepted that: they think Ciro's a good person, and they can accept that you can also be a good person even without doing Falun Gong.\n\nCiro does feel Falun Gong makes Ciro's mother-in-law more reluctant to use or actively search for <<flg-medication,medication or treatment>>. But he thinks it is also linked to the fact that she didn't have a very good education or a good health system around. However, if Ciro and his wife give her something, she will take it. Ciro's wife does not have any resistance to medication.\n\nOne thing that does worry Ciro is that Ciro's mother in law sleeps too little every night, doing one of the Falun Gong meditations late in the evening, and then waking up very early to a long series of reading and exercise sessions. But it is hard to say if she would be any different without Falun Gong, it could just be her nature.\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://www.zhihu.com/question/27659795 at <<zhihu>>\n\n=== In the Tweet about his mother in law, Ciro Santilli says \"correctional facility\", but reeducation through labour has been abolished\n\nHe was not very precise https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576[here], the precise term is \"jail\". He was _not_ talking about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_through_labor Unfortunately it is not possible to edit a Tweet.\n\n[[flg-changed]]\n=== Falun Gong is completely different in the West than it was in China\n\nI believe that it has changed.\n\nBut isn't that the case of every cultural religious movement that migrates to a completely new culture?\n\nMain points which may have changed:\n\n* It has become more organized.\n+\nBut why shouldn't they organize to defend themselves now that they have the chance without being put into prison?\n+\nThe CCP is highly organized and has way more resources.\n* Less emphasis is given to the religious/mystical aspect, and more to the corporal exercises, and health aspect.\n+\nThis may be because people in the \"West\" are:\n+\n** are \"scientific-educated\" atheists who wouldn't go for a \"religion\"\n** already have other religions, which would view FLG as a taboo\n\nAlso maybe only the richest and most educated believers managed to escape China, and thus the movement carried that bias outside China.\n\nIf you know more ways in which it may have changed, let me know.\n\nBut once again, we can know nothing for sure about the past in China because of censorship.\n\nEven if you saw something yourself, how can you be sure that it is representative?\n\nAnd if it has changed, now that it has changed, maybe China should unban it?\n\nSee also:\n\n* https://www.zhihu.com/question/23988890 at <<zhihu>>\n\n=== FLG has been funded by the US government at least once, therefore it is evil\n\n1.5M USD in 2010 for a FLG controlled internet freedom group https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm\n\nBut well, if you are going to do something anyway, and someone offers you money, why wouldn't you take it?\n\nTaking the money does of course give a \"bad impression\" that someone is trying to buy influence, but does it in itself imply that you are doing something bad?\n\nBut do you really think that the US government paid that to buy influence in FLG? What would they force upon that FLG group that they didn't already want to do? Isn't it more likely that the US government wanted them to continue doing exactly what they were doing?\n\nEvery government funds groups it supports, it is an all out war I suppose. Compare that to the propaganda funds of the CCP.\n\nWhat about the funding of political campaigns, which vastly outnumbers 1.5M USD every year?\n\n[[follow-the-law]]\n=== Falun Gong is illegal in China, we must follow the law\n\nThis might be a bad law that should be changed.\n\nIt was perfectly legal for <<nazi,Nazis>> to kill Jews. Does it make that right?\n\nBut many times, the commies don't even bother passing a law, they just fuck people anyways without one: <<rule-of-law>>.\n\n[[flg-fake]]\n=== Falun Gong is fake (法轮功是假的)\n\nThe same can be argued about any other religion or political belief of type: it is better if we organize society in this or that way.\n\nHow can you disprove their belief, when as in any other religion, every affirmation made hinges on \"miracles only happen around when true believers are around\" or \"only true believers can perceive evidence in their hearts / minds directly\". He died of cancer or <<covid>>? Not a true believer, deep withing his heart, something was wrong.\n\nConversely, do you understand the full sequence of experiments that imply quantum field theory? Have you seen videos of those experiments? Have you attended live demonstrations? Do you understand the construction of the experimentation apparatus? Yet, why do you believe it?\n\nMore importantly: what do you propose that should be done about it? Should we kill followers? Or is jail enough?\n\nAlso do let me know when you have achieved irrefutable proof that democracy/freedom of speech are the optimal ways to organize the government: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.\n\nSee also: <<flg-religion>>\n\n[[flg-verifiable]]\n==== FLG never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers\n\nExactly, just like any other <<flg-religion>>, this is why <<ciro-santilli>> is <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>> and thinks Falun Gong metaphysics is bullshit.\n\nNotably, <<li-hongzhi>> explicitly forbids display of magical powers gained by believers to non-believers: <<flg-supernatural-powers>> for \"reasons\". What a convenient coincidence, that prevents any verifiability!\n\nJust like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter[Harry Potter], Falun Gong believers are part of the magical <<flg-religion,Hogwarts world which non-believers, The Muggles>>, cannot access.\n\nThe closest claims to observable Ciro has heard are:\n\n* when pictures are taken in sacred events, notably <<shen-yun>>, sometimes you can see magic Falun energy wheels in the pictures\n* in the homes of some followers, small magic good plants-like fungi-like things have grown\n+\n[[flg-fungi]]\n.Image of the magic good small plants that grew on a <<falun-gong>> believer's home.

They seem to identify those fungi as mini-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udumbara_(Buddhism)[udumbaras], which is just a fancy name that Buddhism scriptures use to refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_racemosa[cluster fig flowers] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/聚果榕[优昙婆罗], amongst a billion other existing phonetic transliterations) emphasising their magic properties.

But not so much when suddenly you or your family is the weirdo...\n\nIf you are not ready to accept the beliefs of others, dictatorship is the only choice for you.\n\nIt is also interesting to note how Falun Gong is a good source of <<censorship-circumvention>> material.\n\nSee also: <<flg-bias>>\n\n[[democracy-is-a-religion]]\n==== Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong?\n\nBecause it also specifies irrational and fundamental aspects of how one should live, notably voting and freedom of speech.\n\nJust like the <<ccp-cult>> has one fundamental belief: <<stability,the Party is always right>>.\n\nBan <<falun-gong>>, and you have banned democracy.\n\nAccept democracy, and you will have <<falun-gong>>.\n\nThere is no in-between.\n\n[[flg-stability]]\n==== Falun Gong had to be banned because it was a threat to the stability of the country\n\nThen they link to the Taping Rebellion:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom\n\nOf course FLG was a threat to the stability of the country.\n\nIt is, as <<ciro-santilli>> has said, a highly organized political power: <<flg-political>>.\n\nHowever, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy>> is a threat to the stability country in the exact same way:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution\n\nAnything that goes against a dictatorship is a threat to the stability of the country.\n\nNow read: <<stability>>\n\n=== Many people say they do FLG only to get VISAs to the USA\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> heard this a few times, and I believe it has happened.\n\nBut I don't see how this is relevant at all to this discussion:\n\n* if they are not really FLG believers, they should be prosecuted, but this says nothing about the real FLG believers,\n* if they are, then why wouldn't they seek a VISA, since they are in constant threat of going to jail or worse in China, and the USA law gives them that right?\n\nSample news:\n\n* https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/09/28/652218318/thousands-could-be-deported-as-government-targets-asylum-mills-clients\n\n[[flg-witness]]\n=== I have personally seen people do bad things because of Falun Gong\n\nEither direct suicide or <<flg-medication,dying because of not taking medication>>.\n\nFirst, I'm not saying I don't believe you, and I'm sorry about what happened.\n\nBut your testimony is worthless unless you give the following:\n\n* clear unique personal identification\n+\nThis is because the CCP has thousands of <<wumao,wumaos>> who could make fake reports.\n+\nThere are basically two ways to do that:\n+\n. your testimony is done in video form on YouTube clearly showing your face as you make it\n. links between a notable social media presence that is hard to achieve, e.g. Twitter with many followers, Stack overflow with a lot of rep, and the account\n+\nEither of those must contain / link to information that uniquely identifies you. Generally, full name, city and date of birth is enough.\n* a precise testimony that states exactly what you saw happen with your own eyes, or heard from people that are very close to you.\n+\nThe testimony must include:\n+\n--\n** when the events happened\n** where they happened, in which city at the very least\n** the full names of who did what\n--\n+\nThis is to:\n+\n** make it easier to verify the truth of the event\n** uniquely identify the event so we don't count a single event multiple times\n\nIf you do provide all of the above, I add your report to a list of reports that I will maintain. This list does not exist yet because there were no valid reports yet.\n\nNext consider this:\n\n* are you sure that Falun Gong made the person do the bad thing, and that the person wouldn't have done it anyway?\n+\nDid someone from Falun Gong told the person to do it?\n+\nI bet that if you look into patients of psychiatrists, you will find more suicides than average. So should we ban psychiatry?\n* are you sure that the order came from <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>, and that it was not just some disgruntled local leader using Falun Gong for his personal madness and doing things he did not approve?\n+\nBranch Davidians were inspired by <<christianity>>. So should we ban Christianity? What about the majority of Christians who have never done anything bad?\n* only statistics have any meaning, and it would require a very large number of reports to make up statistics, so you will likely be wasting your time. I will do my part and maintain a list however.\n* if we ask for FLG believers to compile a list of horrors they have suffered, which they have already been doing since the start of the persecution, I bet that their list will be much longer than yours, because they are so <<flg-organized,well organized>>\n\n[[flg-persecution]]\n=== Falun Gong does not have proof of their persecution claims\n\nHow much proof do you think they would be able to get when there is no freedom of the press?\n\nDo you think that forbidding a <<flg-important,70 million>> person religion could have gone smoothly?\n\nDo you think the thousands of personal accounts of human rights violations that exist are all fake, and don't indicate that many, many more have taken place but fallen under censorship?\n\nConversely, there is no reliable proof that FLG is bad as claimed by CCP that has been verified by international media.\n\n[[sun-yi-falun-gong]]\n==== Sun Yi (孙毅, 2008)\n\nDocumentary about him, TODO are the producers Falun Gong believers?\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Masanjia\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/求救信\n\nMasanjia re-education through labor camp where he was kept:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanjia_re-education_through_labor_camp\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬三家女子勞教所 TODO the Chinese page says female-only, weird\n\nCoverage:\n\n* https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-45976946 \"The SOS in my Halloween decorations\"\n\n[[flg-thoughtcrime]]\n=== Someone from movement X did something bad, therefore the movement should be banned\n\nBy this logic, everyone should go to jail.

What would expect from <<flg-important,banning a 70 million person religion>>?\n* it is very unlikely that they had approval or instructions from <<li-hongzhi>>.

On the surface they are cultivating and doing some Fa-rectification things, but they are in fact stirring up trouble and creating disturbances, with some even committing suicide or being gay. What will become of these people? Will they go to the dimension of demons? And what will happen to those who stick up for them?\n\nTeacher: I know about all of that. Unless I have absolutely no choice I don't want to expel them, so I'm observing and watching these things. It's best that these people, if they want to do themselves justice, wake up quickly--wake up quickly! If you're determined to do that, then tell Dafa disciples about the things you've done, and that could help. Time is running short. I'm really worried about you. Don't take Master's mercy so lightly. The Fa has standards.\n____\n+\nand from 1998 canon https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html\n+\n____\nMany people who are capable of cultivating get sucked into them, and some of them engage in suicide - it's a mess\n____\n* maybe people should be allowed to choose how they want to die, see also:\n** <<flg-medication>>\n** <<honour-suicides-in-chinese-history>>\n\n====== Honour suicides in Chinese history\n\nAs https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_in_China&oldid=992138770#History[mentioned on Wikipedia], China has a long history of suicide for altruistic/moral/honour reasons in Confucian tradition, some of which are still celebrated to this day.\n\nThe <<analects>> paragraph <<analects-translation-by-robert-eno-2015,15.9>> says:\n\n____\nThe Master said, The gentleman who is resolute and ren does not seek to live on at the expense of ren, and there are times when he will sacrifice his life to complete ren.\n____\n\n<<mencius-book>> paragraph <<mencius-translation-by-robert-eno-2016,paragraph 6A.10>> says:\n\n____\nI love to eat fish; I also love to eat bear paws. If I can't have both, I will forego the fish and eat the bear paws. I love life; I also love right. If I can't have both, I will forego life and choose to do right. Life is truly something I love, it is just that there is something else I love more, and so I can't hold on to life by devious means. And death is truly something I hate, it is just that there is something I hate more than death, and so there are dangers I will not avoid.\n\nIf a man loves nothing more than life, then won't he use whatever means are required to hold onto it? If a man hates nothing more than death, then won't he use whatever means are required to avoid danger? Yet there are things men won't do in order to avoid danger and live, and from this we know that there are things men love more than life and hate more than death. It is not just worthy men who have such feelings, all men have them; worthies are simply those who do not lose them.\n____\n\nNotable historical figures who committed suicides are are still celebrated to this day include:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan[Qu Yuan] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屈原[屈原], 340-278 BC), is celebrated in the <<dragon-boat-festival>>, the third most important festival in modern China.\n+\nHe committed suicide by drowning himself in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miluo_River[Miluo River], modern Hubei Province, while holding a rock, after his country's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)[Chu] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/楚国[楚国])) capital was taken by the Qin enemies during the <<warring-states-period>>.\n+\nHe is a symbol of patriotism respected to this day.\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zixu[Wu Zixu] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伍子胥[伍子胥], ???-484 BC)\n\nThese sound exactly like examples that <<xi-dada>> would want his army to keep in mind: ultimate sacrifice for the motherland.\n\n[[flg-political]]\n=== People from movement X are only in it for political power\n\nFor every desire of the masses, there will be amoral representatives that will step to use that power.\n\nStill, those representatives cannot gain power if there is no backing desire from society.\n\nThe only advantage of <<richer,democracy>>, is that those representatives have to pretend harder to do things for that group to retain their power.\n\nFalun Gong believers obviously have the right to do politics, just like any other person, and Ciro greatly encourages this.\n\nBut Ciro does not like that Falun Gong tends to not call itself a political force, when it clearly is. But full disclosure is not a legal obligation, and many many media outlets don't really disclose their obvious political connections.

As usual, everything in Falun Gong is explained in an indirect roundabout way.\n\nOther related canon mentions https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2003/3/21/33575.html \"Explaining the Fa During the 2003 Lantern Festival at the U.S. West Fa Conference\":\n\n____\nQuestion: When elections were held in our district, there were people who went to help a few congressional candidates that supported Dafa. But some people thought we shouldn't get ourselves involved in politics, and that we shouldn't rely on ordinary people to do things for Dafa. Is that understanding correct?\n\nTeacher: It's correct in principle, but for this specific matter you should look at it this way. If you say Dafa disciples can't get involved in ordinary society's politics, I wouldn't say that's 100% correct. What I told you was that Dafa doesn't get involved in politics. And a lot of our Dafa disciples work in politics, that's their job. So if there's a government election, should you take part in it? If you take part in it and cast your vote, well then you've gotten involved in politics. A Dafa disciple cultivating in the ordinary society means that you try your best to cultivate while conforming to the ordinary society, and then there won't be a problem. You, too, are a member of the ordinary society. And the existence of the ordinary society is necessary for Dafa, for the cosmos, and for sentient beings. We can only help maintain it and can't disrupt it. When you're supposed to vote, just go vote, that's not a problem. If you say that a certain Congressman is your personal friend, and you'd like to help him do something, then of course there might be things that involve elections and you'd be doing volunteer work—that doesn't matter. But our Dafa as a whole doesn't get involved in politics, and we can't do anything political in the name of Dafa. For Dafa disciples, validating the Fa should be the priority, though.\n\nThe last time there was an election in Taiwan, I had a veteran practitioner call the person in charge of the Taiwan Dafa Association and make it clear to the public that Dafa Associations take no stance on elections. If an individual practitioner wants to support someone, that's his personal business and it doesn't represent Dafa. There were Dafa disciples supporting both of the parties. The Falun Dafa Association has no political opinion regarding any party's election, and it doesn't get involved. As individual practitioners you can support whoever you'd like. That's how it works.\n____\n\nThe last paragraph is really great, as it indicates how Li's communication works. His top tenants are known, and their word is as good as the master's.\n\nhttps://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/20040412L.html[] also has some good quotes:\n\n____\nQuestion: During Taiwan's presidential election, some students' human attachments got stirred up. Was it a test arranged by the old forces? What's the right way for us to handle this?\n\nTeacher: Even if the sky were to fall, a cultivator's righteous thoughts would stay unshaken--that is cultivation, and that is remarkable. (Applause) A cultivator is not attached to anything in this world. Dafa disciples' cultivation takes a different form today. In cultivation you do your best out in the world to conform to ordinary society, you have normal jobs in ordinary society, and you have your families, jobs, and all that--you are closely tied to society. With the Taiwan election, some students thought a certain person was pretty good and so they wanted to vote for him, while others thought a different person was pretty good and wanted to vote for that one. People have their own, different views, and there's nothing wrong with that. A person's own actions out in society don't represent Dafa. But you can't be attached to those things the way ordinary people are.\n\nWhoever you vote for, I can't, as your Master, say that you're wrong, nor do I get involved in those things. That's because the path I ask you to take has you cultivate in ordinary society. Cultivators can only benefit a society. You cultivate in ordinary society but you don't steer human society in one direction or another.\n\nSo for each student, it's fine for you to vote as an individual for whomever you want. It's just that you can't be too attached. But through the persecution against Dafa disciples in Mainland China, Dafa disciples have seen through something, and so some are thinking, \"Whoever is close to the evil that's persecuting us, I won't vote for him.\" (Applause) And as your Master I have no objection to that either. (Audience laughs, applauds) Those are the students' own thoughts, and as your Master I haven't told you who to vote for. Still less will I tell you to take any group action, and that's not allowed. (Audience laughs)\n____\n\n.https://youtu.be/ArfGyo6HQ_E?t=1175 Ciro really liked what https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/religious-studies/faculty/mathew-schmalz[Doctor Matthew N.

Falun Gong has obviously gone in this political direction, and that is a positive sign about the religion.\nvideo::ArfGyo6HQ_E[youtube,height=400,width=600,t=1175]\n\n[[flg-trump]]\n==== Falun Gong supports Donald (Trump, 法轮功支持特朗普)\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> believes without non-circumstantial evidence that the huge majority of Falun Gong believers strongly supports Trump.\n\nCiro feels that Falun Gong's support of Trump is a fundamental religious issue to the group.\n\nFalun Gong seems to believe that Trump is perfect and that everything that he says is true and good. He is essentially a supernatural force of good, as well shown at: <<you-are-not-alone-by-tony-chen-music>>. And his opponents, e.g. Biden and the Left, are the opposite.\n\nLike everything else concrete, it is not clear if <<li-hongzhi>> has directly supported this or not.\n\nCiro feels without proof however that it is extremely likely that he has given very clear private directives to his top tenants to support Trump, notably to the heads of the key <<falun-gong-media>> organizations.\n\nAnd then this belief gets pumped endlessly through the Falun Gong media, which completely unilaterally praises and supports Trump and criticizes his opponents, so that all believers understand that this is Li Hongzhi's desire.\n\nEdit: around 2021-05-15, this got published on <<minghui>>: https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2021/5/18/大纪元新唐人媒体法会讲法-425888.html[]. It is not on <<flg-canon,falundafa.org>> yet, but is extremelly likely to be uploaded later and can already be consiered canon. The title is \"Fa Teachings at the <<epoch-times>>/<<ntdtv>> media meeting\", and it contains the first, unumbiguous support of Trump done in Canon. Although such support took a long time to come out publicly in canon, <<flg-transparent,which ciro-santilli condems>>, it was a huge positive step forward towards transparency, as it makes Falun Gong's pre-exising but unannounced religious support for Donald trump publicly official. The key quote on Google Translate is:\n\n____\nEveryone knows that the former president of the United States could not be re-elected, and he was taken down by improper means. I only talk about this phenomenon. Isn't it a manifestation of the current state of society? Everyone knows that the former president wants to talk about traditions and restore traditions. What he has to do is to change the moral quality of people and society in a better direction, and to restore society to a better social state. Is he going against the current heavenly principle? Because God's law is not working. Is he against the trend of this society? He is going against the current, and he wants to suffocate the current. If it's a country, maybe he can do it; what about the entire human society, it's too difficult. So, if the entire universe is like this, can it be intercepted? Unstoppable. So, those gods who took him down and those bad gods in the old universe were as timid as they had stolen things in their hearts. They knew what he was doing was good. Do not you know? all know. Although those gods are corrupt, at least he still understands these things\n____\n\nwhich therefore clearly says Trump is a manifestation of supernatural forces of good, and also clearly says that the 2020 American election was in fact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election[stolen by the Democrats as per Donald Trump's accusations].\n\nIt could have been even more direct, but <<ciro-santilli>> considers this more than direct enough. A Brazillian saying comes to mind: \"Para bom entendedor, meia palavra basta\" (For the Connoisseur/Expert, half a word is enough). This was notably used as part of an relentless advertisement campain when Ciro was young (certainly too young to drink) for the overly-long-named beer brand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil_Kirin[Schincariol], suggesting that you could just call is \"schin\", e.g. to order it at a bar. Sample ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-UWr1RIQU[]. Anyways, back to Falun Gong, when it is the word of <<li-hongzhi,Living God himself>>, even a quarter-word is enough I guess.\n\nPrior to that, the most direct public suggestion we can find that Li Hongzhi directly supported Trump was in 2020-11-08 https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/11/8/n12534746.htm when the <<epoch-times>> published a poem by <<li-hongzhi>> which Ciro believes is clearly directly supporting Trump, since it was released just after Trump was announced to have lost the presidential elections, amidst claims of electoral fraud under investigation, which Falun Gong media fully and completely supported. The official translation can be found in <<flg-canon>> https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20201108A.html[]:\n\n____\nOn the General Election\n\nIn this majestic universe, the communist devil is making trouble +\nFraud and corruption are harming a great nation +\nAll the machinations make people only more despondent +\nWhen will justice be upheld and our conscience restored? +\n\nHongzhi Li +\nNovember 8, 2020\n____\n\nTo be completely fair, Trump has been vocal about China's threat way before <<covid,COVID>>, and correctly so in Ciro's opinion, and therefore is a much needed ally of the Falun Gong movement, and to anyone that opposes China's threat, like Ciro does.\n\nFurthermore, Ciro does believe that there might be a Democrat bias to media, and that certainly <<hate-speech,social media like Twitter should never ever censor any political statements as it has done for Trump>>.\n\nAnd of course, so long as those pro-Trump campaigns respect the laws of the country, Falun Gong is free to do it and must not be interfered with. As if other major American media didn't have political agendas: <<usa-based-media-bias>>.\n\nThis is exactly the same, in fact, as to how <<flg-religion,religious affiliation>> has a huge impact in how the average American votes: https://theconversation.com/how-strong-a-role-does-religion-play-in-us-elections-133224[].\n\nIt seems that Trump's immigration policies have turned Asian Americans towards the democrat opposition however as of 2019: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18308137/asian-american-voters-immigration-democrats-donald-trump[].\n\nOne saving point of the republicans for Asians is the opposition to university quotas instance, which many Asians feel blocks their high performing kids from top schools for less deserving students. This is suggested for example at: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/yang-asian-americans-affirmative-action/605917/ \"Opposition to affirmative action was pulling Asians toward the GOP. Then Yang's campaign began to gather momentum.\"\n\nExamples:\n\n* NBC News claims that the <<epoch-times>> has donated to Trump propaganda: $1.5 million https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121\n* after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election[2020 United States presidential election], <<falun-gong-media>> such as <<epoch-times>> was one of the very few medias to not immediately dismiss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election[Trump's accusations of electoral fraud], as baseless e.g. on 2020-12-12 https://web.archive.org/web/20201212014230/https://www.theepochtimes.com/ the front page read \"Election outcome unclear amid legal challenges\", at which point most had been shot down.

That's how things are in a troubled world. Many people didn't expect Trump to be elected in the last U.S. election, but he was. Some people believe that things are supposed to go a certain way, but then they turn out otherwise. I have always said that divine beings are in control of human affairs, and that it is they who have the say. But if I speak too much about it or get into the specifics, it might negatively impact our saving people, so I won't go into it.\n____\n\nAs usual, Hongzhi beats round the bush, as per \"Different Levels of Truth\" of <<orange-papers>>. Ciro feels it <<flg-transparent,would be better for Falun Gong if he just publicly said that believers must support Trump>>.\n\nOne wonders how Falun Gong views Trump's ideology of \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape[grabbing them by the pussy]\".

This is consistent with Ciro's understanding of FLG's view of the world, where <<falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils>> (\"I see the true light - You are the Chosen One to fight the Red Demon\") and therefore Trump is the manifestation of a supernatural force oof Good. The Chinese version is even more open about Trump's God-like status: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZrVbX8jV_o[], and contains perls such as (official translation) \"I see hope - you are the Chosen One to save the world\" and \"Trump, Trump, you are not alone! Gods and Buddhas are here with you!\". The extensive use of Trump's slogan \"Make America great again\" is also in line with Falun Gong's belief that the world was Good before, but has become Evil today. <<epoch-times>> made a https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/18/2/1/n10105396.htm[profile of Tony in 2018].\nvideo::WaWjFeo0BgU[youtube,height=400,width=600]\n\n=== Western media has exaggerated reports on FLG for propaganda reasons\n\nPossibly true, but which reports are you talking about specifically?\n\nAll that I care about is:\n\n* it is censored today\n* if you do it you go to jail\n* there were tens of millions of followers at the time of the ban\n\nwhich I think are undeniable.\n\nThe only question that matters is: should it be banned or not?\n\n=== Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of human rights violations done to Falun Gong believers?\n\nBesides the obvious prohibition of their most fundamental belief, so e.g. being tortured.\n\nLet's just focus on the evidence:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CedVnJOgwg4 \"Undercover video reveals brutal treatment of Falun Gong prisoners inside Chinese labor camps\" by \"FOX 11 Los Angeles\" published May 21, 2019. Names mentioned: Fuquan Yin,\n\n[[flg-organ-harvesting]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of organ harvesting made by Falun Gong believers?\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/對中國共產黨摘取法輪功學員及良心犯器官的指控\n\nIn short: Ciro believes that it has happened to many people.\n\nLong version follows.\n\nIt is obviously very hard to prove and quantify it definitely, much like it was hard to prove the Holocaust: bodies were cremated, and bribes were paid.\n\nEven if we had a video showing the whole process, showing the whole money flow from the donor to the prison guard, it would still be hard to quantify it, so I do have some room for doubt in this opinion.\n\nBut consider the following, which is based on what Ciro has heard.\n\nEven Chinese officials have admitted that in the past, if the body of the executed person is not claimed by family, then the organs can be extracted even without the consent of the prisoner:\n\n* 2014-12-04 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-30324440 \"China to stop harvesting executed prisoners' organs\"\n* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/china-still-using-executed-prisoners-organs-transplants-vatican\n* https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html\n\nPerhaps now that they claim that there is a large voluntary organ donor database, then this has stopped or been reduced, but let's focus on that period when the extractions were widely done.\n\nFrom this, even though China does not publish execution statistics, we can imagine that a large part of the organs come from prisoners sentenced to death.\n\nThen, consider that a <<flg-important,70 million>> person religion was banned, leading to a huge influx of prisoners from that religion.\n\nFLG followers are just de-facto criminals like any other, and so extracting their organs is also de-facto legal.\n\nAlso, people from that religion don't drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs, and their organs are of good quality.\n\nFurthermore, FLG prisoners continue to not bow down to the government even in prison, e.g. by doing their <<flg-religion,Falun Gong meditation>>, which makes them clearly identifiable and dangerous to the system.\n\nFinally, add to that mix the <<corruption,huge level of corruption found in dictatorships>>.\n\nDon't you think, then, that it is extremely likely that it has happened many times that such people have been selected to be executed earlier than others on average, due to the monetary value of their organs?\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6 (https://web.archive.org/web/20191118135832/https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6[archive]) \"Analysis of official deceased organ donation data casts doubt on the credibility of China's organ transplant reform\" by Matthew P.

It also amusingly says that D.F. is a \"Distinguished Professor of Music and Dance at Fei Tian College in New York\", which is likely where many of Shen Yun's dancers are trained, and therefore controlled by himself to a large extent. It's Falun Gong's dance-only-for-now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University[BYU].\n* LHZ mentions NDTV, Epoch Times and Shen Yun extensively on his <<flg-canon>>. TODO link to source, this based on unintentionally overhearing to my family members reading it.\n\nFurthermore, Falun Gong practitioners directly lobby foreign governments to take action against human rights abuses in China, e.g.:\n\n* https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+P7-RC-2013-0562+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\n* https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-court-cisco-must-be-held-accountable-aiding-chinas-human-rights-abuses\n\nLike any other religion, they have all the right to take those actions, and it is definitely in their best interest, and perhaps in the best interest of the whole world, that they do so.\n\nThe only thing that annoys me is their lack of self perception on this matter: the large majority of Western people would definitely classify them as an organized political force after having observed their activities. When they say otherwise, they are hurting their own credibility.\n\n[[flg-transparent]]\n===== FLG media is not transparent about its affiliation\n\nAgreed, and it is a point that hurts more than helps their cause.\n\nThis is very clearly put as well at \"Front groups\" of the <<orange-papers>>.\n\nBut the media is not legally obliged to state their affiliation.\n\nAnd if that were the case, then we should force _all_ newspapers to start taking polls of how many employees follow which religion and support which political party, and then put that in their print.\n\n[[flg-intolerance]]\n==== Falun Gong dislikes several other groups like homosexuals and some other religions\n\nLike most <<flg-religion,old religions>>, related: <<hate-speech>>.\n\n<<flg-canon,Canon quote>> from https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980904L.html[]:\n\n____\nQuestion: Why is homosexuality considered immoral?\n\nTeacher: Think about it, everyone: Is homosexuality human behavior? Heaven created man and woman. What was the purpose? To procreate future generations. A man being with a man, or a woman with a woman - it doesn't take much thought to know whether that's right or wrong. When minor things are done incorrectly, a person is said to be wrong. When major things are done incorrectly, it's a case of people no longer having the moral code of human beings, and then they are unworthy of being human.\n____\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> strongly disagrees with that view, because it is the type of thing that makes people feel bad for characteristics that they have, but cannot change.\n\nAlso, it is very hard to pass any kind of law that forces people not to be racist/discriminatory, because there is always the lingering question: what if they are right about a particular point?\n\nBecause clearly everyone has innate characteristics that make them better suited for certain activities than others, we when we select candidates for a job, we are basically discriminating amongst candidates.\n\nAlso any such law can have the opposite effect, acting as a justification for further hate.\n\nYou and I dislike certain personality traits without any logical reason.\n\nDemocracy dislikes dictators, and it is not necessarily rational.\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<intolerance>>\n* <<gay-rights>>\n\n===== Falun Gong on races\n\n<<li-hongzhi>> clearly classifies races as a metaphysical concept e.g. on <<flg-canon>> https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990502L.html[]:\n\n____\nStrictly speaking, Indians, Egyptians, Persians, the yellow race, the white race, and the black race are the six major races of the present Earth. All the other ones are mixed races.\n____\n\nMixed race people seem to have some metaphysical defect/peculiarity, https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/1997L.html[]:\n\n___\nQuestion: What did you say last time that a person of mixed race has lost?\n\nTeacher: He has lost the body that comes from the top down through to here. Let me put it this way: People of the yellow race have people of the yellow race up there, and people of the white race have people of the white race up there. He's lost this thread.\n___\n\nbut they can still go to Heaven:\n\n____\nQuestion: Can a person of mixed race succeed in cultivation?\n\nTeacher: Whether someone can cultivate and whether he can succeed in cultivation are all up to the person himself. If a person of mixed race can persist in cultivation, he can reach Consummation just the same. When he succeeds in cultivation his Primordial Spirit will return to wherever he came from.\n____\n\n[[flg-medication]]\n==== FLG believers are less likely to take necessary medication\n\nBased on what <<ciro-santilli>> saw and heard, he does believe, without any clear statistical evidence, that it is very likely that it hs happened to in many cases that some Falun Gong believers refused to take modern medications and died of diseases that could be otherwise cured.\n\nBut consider the following:\n\n* what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab\n* maybe people should be link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation[allowed to choose how they want to die], and not to take medication if they don't want to\n+\nAs the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation[Parks and Recreation] caricaturally liberal character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson[Ron Swanson] puts it https://youtu.be/_UlNnETAZeI?t=48[about the United States]:\n+\n____\nThe whole point of this country is if you wanna eat garbage, balloon up to six hundred pounds and die of a heart attack at forty three, you can! You are free to do so. To me that's beautiful.\n____\n+\n<<freedom-with-a-capital-f>> also comes to mind.\n* maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication\n* several <<flg-religion,religions>>, including <<christianity>> have miraculous cure claims. My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!\n* maybe the main reason why communists banned Falun Gong is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well? See also <<rule-of-law>>.\n* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication\n* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyway. Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system? See also: <<flg-thoughtcrime>>.\n* all the following also reduce people's lifespan:\n+\n--\n** riding motorcycles vs. cars/buses\n** smoking\n** moving to a poor country to do charity there\n** eating fast food\n--\n+\nForbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?\n\nEspecially In the beginning, Falun Gong did put a lot of emphasis on its health benefits, just <<zhong-gong,like all the other contemporaneous Qi Gong practices>>, and it is likely that especially many in the first generation of believers do believe it more than others.\n\nFor example, the main initial public announcement of Falun Gong was at a <<history-of-falun-gong,Health Exposition in Beijing>>.\n\nIn <<flg-canon>> itself, this is not super explicit and emphasised as far as Ciro can see. Zhuan Falun https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_74.htm[] has a chapter entitled \"On the Issue of Healing Illnesses\", that contains:\n\n____\n Let us talk about the most common illnesses, like tumors, infections or osteoproliferation etc., found in the human body. In another space, a very deep space, there lies an evil intelligent entity.\n____\n\nand the general very beaty-around-the-bush suggestion that if you do master Falun Gong fully, you will be healthy. But with the usual disclaimer that \"you have to become a master\", and since \"there are no graduates\", no one is ever a master for sure, and as usual \"you don't get the promised goodies\", as as mentioned at: <<orange-papers>>.\n\nhttps://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/mgjf.htm contains some more direct quotes that suggest that you can take medicine, but you have to try and bear the pain first, and if you can't, it's a sign that you haven't practiced Falun Gong well enough:\n\n____\nSo when you take medicine now you're killing this sickness or the virus at the surface. Medicine can truly kill viruses at the surface. Yet a practitioner's gong[7] is automatically destroying viruses and karma. But as soon as medicine kills the surface virus that has seeped over from other dimensions, the virus—karma—over on the other side will know, since everything is alive, and it will stop coming over. Then you feel that you've recovered because you took the medicine. But let me tell you that it nonetheless accumulates over there. Life after life human beings are accumulating this stuff. When the accumulation reaches a certain extent, the person becomes incurable and when he dies he's totally destroyed. He loses his life—forever loses his life. That's how horrifying it is. So here I've explained to you the relationship. It's not that people aren't allowed to take medicine. When an everyday person gets sick he definitely needs medical treatment.\n\nBut how do we cultivators deal with it? Aren't we purifying your body? Like the annual rings of a tree, there is karma at the very core, and at every layer, life after life, of your body. When you practice cultivation, I keep pushing this karma outward from the center; I push, and push, and push, and push until I completely push the karma out for you. And not all of this can go through the surface of our bodies. You wouldn't be able to bear it if all of it were to go through the surface of your body. Only a portion of it comes out through the surface. But you still feel that you're suddenly getting sick, you find it terribly uncomfortable and painful, can't bear it, regard yourself as an everyday person, and go take medicine. Then you can go ahead and take medicine, as we've never said that everyday people can't take medicine. We only say that your enlightenment quality isn't up to par and that you didn't pass this test well.\n____\n\nCiro does however believe that newer generations believe in this much less, notably because the first believer generation is all basically old or dead, and soon will be entirely dead. This might also have been de-emphasised to reduce the bullshit aspects and help the international spread of Falun Gong. Not even Falun Gong believers are that blind. And this perfectly mimics the beginning of Christianism, where the first generations gave much more emphasis to miraculous cures.\n\n<<me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-2017>> has an anecdote on this, which Ciro feels sounds believable:\n\n[[me-and-li-tumor]]\n____\nI think it was Lynn's* death that finally made me realise it was time to leave. I'd seen the writing on the wall about a year prior when I saw her at a yearly \"Fa conference\" for believers of Falun Gong, otherwise known as Falun Dafa, to exchange experiences and grow spiritually together. An executive assistant at a Queensland valuation firm, I'd gotten to know her over the years in various events as a warm and level-headed lady who had time for everyone. But I'd noticed she had developed a bulge on the side of her head and I was trying not to look at it when I talked to her. I saw, or at least I believed I saw, some pain in her smile. She was probably questioning herself over and over again what \"attachments\" she hadn't let go of that were causing this sickness to spread through her body and endanger her life. I wanted to tell her to just go to a hospital, although I wasn't at this stage resolute enough in my gradual return to logic. Another part of me feared that by looking at it I was acknowledging it — something you don't do with illnesses in Falun Gong because Master Li Hongzhi teaches that his pupils don't get illnesses. He can cure you but only if you don't have any loopholes in your belief in him and his teachings. Some people with solid beliefs can actually die due to others around them having flaws in their thinking, Li says. Just thinking the wrong way is perilous when you're a Falun Gong practitioner.\n\nI later heard through the grapevine of Lynn's death. The cancer went into her brain and she passed away in extreme pain, probably believing to the end that it was her fault she was in this awful predicament. In a way, I guess it was.\n____\n\nand more interesting anecdotes follow, see source.\n\nAnd Ciro has felt this first hand with his <<wife,mother-in-law>>. Whenever she has a health worry, first she tries to hide it. But then she casually mentions it without much thought because she speaks all the time the poor lady, may she be blessed. And then, when Ciro says: OK, let's try and treat it, even for trivial things that might have simple treatments, she immediately smiles a compassionate smile of \"I'm a Falun Gong believer, I don't need that\". This makes Ciro really mad. He tries to not show it, because he thinks people should be able to choose how they die. But Li promises the powers of <<flg-cross-dimensional-vision,remote, cross dimensional and past/future vision>> to some believers, and yet, blinds some of them to the obvious fact that they are aging, and, slowly but surely, their own bodies are starting to fail, like everyone else's will at one point.\n\nIt is also interesting to note how the Chinese government itself supported Falun Gong and <<zhong-gong,other Qi Gong practices>> for their health benefits, which is why they grew so large in the first place. <<li-hongzhi>> was even <<history-of-falun-gong,awarded prizes and recognized as a Qi Gong master by state backed organizations in 1992 and 1993>>. And the CCP still has a tendency to support certain non-scientific traditional practices: <<support-for-non-scientific-traditional-practices>>.\n\n[[freedom-with-a-capital-f]]\n.https://youtu.be/kIpaDW3RwtY?t=244 one random thing ex-KGB spy undercover in the USA Jack Barsky mentioned in this BuzzFeed Multiplayer interview stuck to his mind: \"The one thing that you have here, that I believe cannot be found anywhere else in the world is called Freedom, with a capital F\". If people want to die in a certain way, or believe that some bullshit will cure them, they should be allowed. Natural selection will take care of the rest.\nvideo::kIpaDW3RwtY[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=244]\n\nSee also: <<honour-suicides-in-chinese-history>>.\n\n[[falun-gongs-view-of-epidemics]]\n===== Falun Gong's view of epidemics\n\n<<li-hongzhi>> has said in <<flg-canon,canon>> things that lead certain believers (including e.g. <<wife,Ciro's mother in law>>) to believe that because they are good Falun Gong believers, that they are more safe from disease from evil people.\n\nFor example, in the 2003 \"Fa conference\" at the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome[SARS] he https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20030420L.html[said]:\n\n____\nYou must have seen the epidemic that's come along in China now, right? Hasn't a huge epidemic arrived? To put it in human terms, it's Heaven punishing people. What it's targeting, we Dafa disciples know full well: it's targeting those who don't deserve to be saved, who are impossible to save while Dafa disciples clarify the truth, and who aren't useful to the evil rotten spirits. This is the first round of cleansing. Heaven is punishing the evil, yet China is still lying to cover up the number of deaths, and I'll tell you, it's huge, and it hasn't peaked yet. \n____\n\nSuch beliefs have of course carried over directly to <<covid,COVID-19>>.\n\nAn amazing quote from https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/20/183715.html[]:\n\n____\nStay Rational\n\nPandemics and plagues are part of a divine plan and inevitable in the course of history.\n____\n\nStay rational. Believe in God ;-)\n\nEpidemics are also likely moments where religious grow due to more people being more desperate and looking for solace that cannot be found in this shitty world.\n\nIt is indeed tempting to believe that the virus magically kills only the Evil. What reality could be so fucked up where the innocent suffocate to their death? And yet, here we are.\n\n[[li-hongzhi]]\n==== Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/李洪志\n\nLi Hongzhi is the creator of <<falun-gong>>: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi[].\n\nFalun Gong people call him \"master\" (师父), which is a common traditional term used to respectfully address experienced teachers in a disciple (弟子)/teacher relation, e.g. Kung Fu or other crafts.\n\nHowever they also believe that he has many many God-like powers and is comparable figures such as Jesus and Buddha himself.\n\nNotably they believe that he has superpowers, and that everything that he says is the absolute truth of the universe, see also: <<flg-religion>>.\n\nThe term \"master\" is also used for example in the fictional film The Master (2012), which is likely inspired in <<flg-religion,Scientology>>.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> however prefers to call him <<flg-religion,prophet>>, since he feels LHZ is indistinguishable from <<flg-religion,any other religion>>. Guru/<<flg-cult,cult leader>> could also apply.\n\nIt's funny that even though Falun Gong only came up recently in the 80's, we still know relatively little about Li. One is kind of reminded of Jesus! See also <<li-hongzhis-family>> and <<li-hongzhis-hagiography>>.\n\nOne should note however that this is partly by design: at some point in the 90's, Li relatively stepped away from public view. This is because once you reach a critical mass of followers, it is better to let them to the preaching for you, while you hide your obvious human defects in a corner.

Or just kill some minority who is not happy about the situation.\n\nSimilarly, any charismatic leader of a pro-democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.\n\nIf you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.\n\nFinally, LHZ was born in 1951, so he will die in 20 years, unless FLG is true and a miracle happens, and then this argument will become invalid.\n\nFrom what Ciro hears, LHZ has always maintained that he is the only source of truth on FLG (see also \"The Guru is always right\"), and therefore, so his death will very likely remove any danger once and for all.\n\nFurthermore, it also seems to Ciro that FLG is clearly anti-violence and self-harm, so Ciro wonder how many would follow a contradictory order such as killing or suicide? We have had no hint of any incitation to violence so far.\n\nIt is also interesting to look into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown case. When the suicide order came, most people wanted out! Without physically controlling the followers, I don't think you can make them do much.\n\n===== Li Hongzhi's hagiography\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi mentions that there are two versions of the biography:\n\n* An unofficial biography appeared in the first of Li's major publications, <<flg-canon,Zhongguo Falun Gong>>, supposedly authored by journalist Zhu Huiguang (朱慧光).\n+\nThe full text appears to be at available at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130### (God bless <<taiwan,Taiwanese>> piracy, link:++https://web.archive.org/web/20200805093333/http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130###++[archive])\n+\n<<benjamin-penny-the-life-and-times-of-li-hongzhi-2003>> gives the full title of the section + a translation (originally in pinyin, but why?!?! :-)):\n+\n____\n法輪旋轉新天地-記李洪志先生和他創立的法輪功 +\n\"The wheel of the law revolves the new cosmos - on Li Hongzhi and the Falun Gong he founded\".\n____\n* A second, official spiritual biography appeared in early editions of <<flg-canon,Falun Gong's primary text, Zhuan Falun>>.\n+\nIt is shorter than the first, and is marked as authored by the \"Falun Dafa Research Society's President\" (法轮功研究会会长).\n+\nThe Wiki quotes <<benjamin-penny-the-religion-of-falun-gong-2012>>.\n+\nPenny says that it was removed in 1999 (presumably to remove some more glaring magical bullshit help with internationalization).\n+\nA possible Chinese copy might be found at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=165### inside a 1994 version of Zhuan Falun.\n+\nThe section is entitled \"中国法轮功创始人、法轮功研究会会长 李洪志先生小传\", so literally tranlated as a \"profile\" (小传) rather than a full biography. The index marks it as 附 (addendum), and it comes at the end of the book.\n\n===== What will happen to Falun Gong when Li Honzhi dies?\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-Li-Hongzhi-the-founder-of-Falun-Gong-when-he-is-not-in-this-world-anymore/answer/Ciro-Santilli\n\n===== Let's make a mini series about Li Hongzhi's life\n\nCiro can't help but to imagine how Falun Gong came about in detail.\n\nSomeone should write a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(novel)[\"The Last Temptation of Christ\"].\n\nThis deserves an American miniseries like Chernobyl.\n\nIt would manage to piss off both FLG and the CCP, which would be amazing. It is a shame that it is so difficult to find good historical information between the infinite barrages of CCP and FLG propaganda.\n\nIt could show how:\n\n* Li was an ordinary dude who could liked to play the trumpet, which partially explains his focus on <<falun-gong-media,Shen Yun>> and Falun Gong musical street parades\n* Li first heard about Qi Gong, and went to practice it under some dude. Then how he saw other people were so into it, and decided to take this opportunity to make a career out of it during the 80's\n* how he met his wife and had a daughter\n* how he started to notice how people were feeling things during the exercise classes, and started suggesting more and more metaphysics to these first disciples\n* Li could also have some metaphysical moment, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW20LbwAmng but at the same time, he must tell his followers some lies which he does not believe\n* how followers started telling others things and \"experience sharing\" where the cycle of belief stats to take off\n* a clear demonstration of how \"A group of early adopters in Changchun became disenchanted after Li forbade his followers from charging fees for the practice at the end of 1994\" showing dissent within the cult\n* and finally, the immigration and crackdown, and how he put his fingers on those things, and the creation of media, this could be the last episode\n\nEpisodes could be split along:\n\n* Episode 1: pre Qi Gong, shows Childhood, workplaces, early motivations. Ends with first contact with a Qi Gong lesson\n* Episode 2: early Falun Gong. Opens an academy. Starts without metaphysics, but grows into it. Show him knowingly lying, but also seething magic things. The first followers, and top lieutenants. Makes some management mistake, but gets away with it. Could end in a metaphysical scene, or 13 May 1992 initial public lesson. Maybe a scene of Li's visit to <<thailand>> in 1983 (photo from CCP media found on Google).\n* Episode 3: later Falun Gong in China. It grows, show in Chinese news. Power struggles, problems with early lieutenants, and new lieutenants come up. Many people practice on streets. Battle against <<zhong-gong>>. Near 1996, something tips Li off to the fact that the CCP is going to crack down on them, and so he announces that he will be spreading abroad full time. Check out if this was before or after the first Anti FLG newspaper article in 1996-06-17.\n* Episode 4: preaching outside of China and emigration. American permanent residence in 1998. Watches crackdown on television. International Falun Gong media. Show him at Falun Gong New York <<dragon-springs,\"Dragon Springs\">> complex\n\nOr maybe, never mind that boring post 1992 stuff which is already highly public, instead we could focus only on the more interesting pre-1992 events, and finish in 1992.\n\nSo per-early FLG up to 1992, with childhood flashbacks.\n\nThe tone should of course be a mixture of:\n\n* personal insight of the master\n* the love of a follower\n* external view of their shortcomings\n\nParts of the series could be filmed in <<taiwan>> maybe?\n\nSource material: <<history-of-falun-gong>>.\n\nRelated videos:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Wild_Country (2017) about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh[].

To <<ciro-santilli>>, this makes Zhong Gong a perfect example of why <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,FLG metaphysics is bullshit>>: it is obvious that both Zhong Gong and Falun Gong and many others were just random dudes who took advantage of the Qigong fever to create their religions.\n\nTheir prophet is <<zhang-hongbao>>.\n\nInterestingly, like <<li-hongzhi>> who is from <<jilin>>, Hongbao is also from the Northeast of China (<<heilongjiang>>), there must be a reason why those Qi Gong movements come from that region.\n\nUnlike Falun Gong however, Zhong Gong failed to branch the franchise out of China, and basically died out. Hongbao also died in a car crash in 2006 which didn't help. Li Hongzhi however played smarter, and started branching abroad full force in 1996, he likely predicted that the crackdown was inevitale.\n\nWikipedia says it reached 34 million followers in China.\n\nHongbao also has a more spicy history it seems, with sexual allegations and open political goals <<flg-political,unlike Li Hongzhi, who hid his goals better>>. Well played, Li, well played.\n\n<<li-hongzhi>> maintains in <<flg-canon,canon>> that Falun Gong is of course extremely different from all of those other extremely similar Qi Gong religions.

Master Tian Ruisheng was taught this as a ill young boy by a traveling buddhist monk. He was told to practice it every day and not reveal it until 50 years later. He diligently practiced and eventually taught it after 50 years. It quickly became a popular qigong in China.\n____\n+\nThis is exactly the type of \"Creation Story\" that <<li-hongzhi>> invented. Notably, it is not something he just made up to take advantage of the obvious <<qigong-fever>>. No, it is something that he developped his entire life, and only started teaching at that point due to a coincidence!\n+\nThis is notably highlighted in <<diaries-of-being-in-thailand-with-li-hongzhi-s-family>>. Li's sister just casualy never mentioned to her husband that her brother had been having mystical training for several years, until he finally announced it in the early days of <<falun-gong>>.\n+\nIn Tian's case however, he is truly really old. This is possibly a major reason why he didn't get as big as Falun Gong. It is terribly discriminatory, but who wants to look at an old ugly dude? Especially when he's likely teaching stuff that is supposed to cure diseases. <<li-hongzhi>> and \n* https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2000/05/chinese-crackdown-goes-beyond-falun-gong.aspx Chinese Crackdown Goes Beyond Falun Gong (2000) mentions <<zhong-gong>> and <<xiang-gong>>.

A homonym \"墙国\" (wall country) is also known as a reference to the <<gfw>>, https://archive.ph/czYEv[sample usage].\n\nThe app appears to have both content, and also tests to check that you've read the bullshit.\n\nAt https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/mnulkd/china_is_forcing_chinese_to_use_national/gu05o20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 a <<reddit>> user explains:\n\n____\nMany people are also forced to use the app \"强国学习\" in order to keep their jobs. Especially government workers. They have to study XiJinPing thought for certain amount of time each week and do exams.\n____\n\nThis is confirmed e.g. at: https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/studies/voices-middle-east-asia/voices-from-east-asia/xuexi-qiangguo-%E2%80%93-digitalization-of-chinese-propaga.html\n\n____\n\nWithin the first four months of Xuexi Qiangguo’s release, it was the most downloaded app in China with over 100 million downloads, surpassing China’s most popular messaging, social media and mobile payment app, <<wechat>> and the <<tiktok,Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin>>.\n\nTo use the app is not exactly voluntary. The Communist Party has issued directives that requires party members to download the app and use it. Many workplaces have done the same and it has been reported that employees are required to send screenshots to document their progress on the app. If they don’t, they are at risk of a pay deduction.\n\nTo put it in perspective, over 90 million Chinese are members of the Communist Party, and there are nearly 850 million internet users and almost 690 million smart phone users in China, as of 2019. It is, however, not clear whether the people who have downloaded the app genuinely are interested in learning about Xi Jinping’s political ideology, or if they feel like they must download it to show loyalty to the party.\n____\n\n[[fuck-xuexiqiangguo]]\n====== Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo (Fuck学习强国)\n\nhttps://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo[]\n\nThis <<github>> repository appears to help cheat the Xuexi qiangguo, see also: <<github-repositories-with-censored-information>>.\n\nThe program's executable file name is actually `./Fuck学习强国`, a thing of beauty.\n\nSeveral video demos can be found on YouTube:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahHzi1rGDfA \"2021@学习强国辅助之Ai强国&科技强国\" by Axiom Show shows the Android App\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOic-mYcwGA \"习近平的学习强国和fuck 学习强国 | 如何从github上获取fuck xuexiqiangguo | 如何使用fuck xuexiqiangguo\" by \"中国人每日秀 The Chinese Daily Show\" (2019)\n\nAnd there there's an anti-repo for <<wumao>> who oppose the cheating: https://github.com/boycott-fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Boycott-Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo It had 150 stars as of 2021, as oppoesd to 7500 of the cheating repo.\n\nhttps://github.com/TechXueXi/TechXueXi appears to be a \"non-cheating\" assistant?

Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'\n____\n\nOn Part Two, Chapter 5, Winston explains the <<censorship,erasing of the past>> to Julia:\n\n____\nDo you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.\n____\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<censorship-of-images-in-the-soviet-union>>\n* <<baidu-baike-censorship-of-hao-haidong>>\n\nWith the advent of the Internet and <<wayback-machine>>, this has become a bit harder though :-)\n\nThere is also a decent movie made released in the year, you guessed, 1984: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_(1984_film) starring https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hurt[John Hurt].\n\nOn Part Three, Chapter 4, The Law of Gravity quote perfectly illustrates the CCPs approach to lying:\n\n[[law-of-gravity-1984]]\n____\nAnything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.\n____\n\n.https://youtube.com/watch?v=flhggnpCeHw Gravity scene from the 1984 movie.\nvideo::flhggnpCeHw[youtube,height=400,width=600]\n\nRelated:\n\n* https://ibisbill.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nineteen-eighty-four-in-chinese/ asks how much George Orwell thought about China at the time\n\n[[newspeak]]\n==== Newspeak (新语)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新語_(一九八四)\n\nSee also \"Cult-speak\" from <<orange-papers>>, related <<ccp-cult>>.\n\n[[community-with-shared-future-for-mankind]]\n===== Community with shared future for mankind (人类命运共同体)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_with_shared_future_for_mankind\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/人类命运共同体\n\n[[thoughtcrime]]\n==== Thoughtcrime (思想罪)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/思想罪\n\nSee also: <<thoughtcrime>>\n\n[[brave-new-world]]\n=== Brave New World (美丽新世界, 1932)\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World\n* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美麗新世界\n\nThis is basically a less good <<nineteen-eighty-four>>, but the following passage https://archive.org/stream/ost-english-brave_new_world_aldous_huxley/Brave_New_World_Aldous_Huxley_djvu.txt[from Chapter 17] rocks:\n\n____\nThe Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the book- shelves.

This was soon after <<ciro-santilli>> mentioned <<cac-report-website>> at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/149#issuecomment-688084645[]. This is presumably the censor's web UI to review reports. \"jb\" from jbcz presumably means Ju Bao (举报), the CZ Ciro couldn't guess. 2020-10-14 had another hit from: http://jbcz.12377.cn/report/load/operate.index[]. 2021-05-18 https://jbcz.12377.cn to https://cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship[] <<mirrors>>.

So we just call all of them wumaos.\n____\n\nBut of course, the <<ccp-cult,CCP is a cult>> (and <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy, a religion>>), and therefore <<preconceived,any discussion is also pointless>> in general.\n\nTo a large extent, wumao's goals are to dilute useful conversation with shit, normally <<evil-west>> and <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.\n\nThis leads to endless idiotic conversions of type:\n\n____\nYou: Chinese friend, your house is on fire, let's try to put the fire out!\n\nWumao: I don't care, your house is also on fire!\n\nYou: that's true, that fire is also very serious, and I'm trying to put it out!\n\nWumao: look everyone, his house is on fire!

But snuffing out wumaos is important, and must be done.\n\nIf we were to give up on privacy completely, one possible rule would be: block anyone that lives in China and whose revenue therefore cannot be investigated properly by your government to determine if they are funded by the CCP.\n\nHere are some people completely against blocking wumaos.

At a time when all of China's telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunication company that could compete with, and ultimately replace, foreign competitors.\n\nDuring its first several years the company's business model consisted mainly of reselling private branch exchange (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, it was reverse-engineering imported switches and investing heavily in research and development to manufacture its own technologies. By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R&D staff and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises.\n\nThe company's first major breakthrough came in 1993 when it launched its C&C08 program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market.\n\nHuawei also won a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People's Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as \"small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships\". In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, telling him that \"switching equipment technology was related to national security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military.\" Jiang reportedly agreed with this assessment.\n\nAnother major turning point for the company came in 1996 when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a national champion, and established new research and development offices.\n____\n\nAt any point the Chinese government could make a request that they cannot deny.\n\nList of bad things Huawei has done: https://github.com/evil-huawei/evil-huawei Mostly not political.\n\nList of Huawei joke:s https://github.com/HuaweiJoke/Huawei-Joke \"This project is collecting jokes about Huawei company that are deleted due to censorship.

Cook the minimum possible so that it is not raw. This also means taking the jiaozi out of the hot water as soon as they are done.\n* after the dumplings rise to the surface after a few minutes, let it boil, and then put some cold water on top of the hot water. Repeat this two, three or four times until they are fully cooked. This helps the jiazi keep a strong peel.\n\nThe best way to eat them is to pour some vinegar and ready-to-eat spicy preparations like <<laoganma>> or Ciro's favorite, <<fansaoguang>> in the bowl, and then dip them one by one.\n\nYou can also drink the soup, or for cold days, actually eat the jiaozi with their soup.

But it could be so much more awesome!\" This makes non-real restaurants twice as bad. So beware, there is no turning back.\n\nMaybe we should institute a Foodie Dictatorship (美食家独裁) that prevents such fake restaurants from hiding real Chinese food???\n\n[[resturants--rating-system]]\n==== Rating system\n\n* tier 1: amazing, worth a trip\n* tier 2: worth it, but not exciting, so not worth a trip just for it\n* tier 3: I wouldn't go there\n\n[[resturants--how-to-find-good-restaurants]]\n==== How to find good restaurants\n\n* go with Chinese food-loving friends to Chinese restaurants\n* read up Chinese restaurant recommendation websites written in Chinese by Chinese for Chinese\n* read up small shady Chinese food recommendation websites by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinophile[sinophiles like Ciro Santilli]\n\nBig Western sites like Google Maps reviews and TripAdvisor are completely and utterly useless for this and will recommend places in which poor non-Chinese which don't know what real Chinese food is like.\n\nIf you go out on the street by yourself, you are very unlikely to find really good Chinese food since the enormous majority of Chinese restaurants are not real Chinese food.\n\nIf there are only Chinese clients inside the restaurant, it is a good indicator that it might be good. If all clients people are Western, run away.\n\nWestern people don't know what good Chinese food is, so if you are not in a place that has a very large Chinese population, real Chinese food restaurants cannot survive, and won't exist. This usually implies being in large cities of rich countries.\n\nBeware of restaurant owner changes: if the menu looks a bit different, it has likely happened.\n\nThis is <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>>, but here goes: if the place looks as if it is maintained by more recent immigrants, and looks more modern, it is more likely to be good. There are however some venerable older uncles who have cooked well their entire lives and are still fine. Things tend to water down across generations, and there was likely not enough real Chinese clientele for them to serve real Chinese food and survive in the past.\n\nIf a restaurant advertises itself as \"Asian\", it is less likely to be very good.\n\nConversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good).\n\nIt is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.\n\nJust beware of \"Sichuan\" restaurants: their cuisine is so well known even in the West that I've seen many not so good restaurants that describe themselves like that, even if the owners are from another region. But there are many good ones which really are from there as well.\n\n[[resturants--similar-lists]]\n==== Similar lists\n\n[[resturants--how-to-order]]\n==== How to order\n\nFor all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:\n\n* want the most typical dishes, not what the foreign locals eat, but what the Chinese eat\n* can eat spicy food, way more than any foreign local person can.\n+\nThe spice level you generally want is \"zhong1 la4\" (medium spicy)\n+\nIf you can't eat spicy, either learn or stop reading now and accept the fact that you will never eat good Chinese food.\n* if the restaurant is from some region, ask for dishes from the region, and which are different from other regions.\n+\nI was once <<dumplings>> (super popular dish everywhere in China which I buy frozen and eat every 3 days) in a Tibetan restaurant... Yes, I do believe Tibetans also eat jiaozi! :-)\n* Speaking a little Chinese goes a long way towards convincing the owners that you can handle the real thing.\n\nOnly order dishes with meat. Those without are not worth the money/time. Aubergine is the exception.\n\n[[restaurants--france]]\n=== France 法国\n\nTraiteurs are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made foods in a glass showcase for you to choose how big your portions will be.\n\nThey are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but I have never found one that serves exceptional Chinese food, so beware.\n\n[[restaurants--france--paris]]\n==== Paris 巴黎\n\nParis has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China in the whole world centered in the 14eme arrondissement, plus a lot of Chinese students with money around.\n\nAs a result, you can find some of the best Chinese food in the world outside of China!\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://carnetdecroute.blogspot.fr\n* http://cnkick.net/2013/09/10/les-meilleurs-restaurants-chinois-de-paris-le-guide-cn-kick/\n* https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Chinese-restaurants-in-Paris\n* https://www.newsavour.com/restaurants/ Chinese only, Paris, website subsidiary of some larger Chinese group.\n\n* Restaurant Sichuan (川里川外)\n+\n17 Rue le Peletier, 75009 Paris\n+\nXianglaxie.\n+\nLast checked: 2017/06\n* Chez Yong (Ding Ding Xiang, 鼎鼎香)\n+\n42, rue de la Colonie, 75013 Paris\n+\n** shui zhu niu rou\n** dishes with intestines\n* La Chine sur la langue (舌尖美味)\n+\n163 rue Saint-Denis, 75002 Paris\n+\n** Spicy soup with Chinese charcuteries.

Works, but a bit clunky.\n\nMaybe some day something will be extracted from: https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi which jas a huge JSON of character data.\n\nWhen you want to learn \"how to say something in Chinese\", the only valid routes are:\n\n* does it have a Wikipedia page? Go on the English one then change language\n* put an English sentence on https://translate.google.com/[Google Translate], then Google for it.\n+\nIf it is a common word, it will give useless dictionary results, so search instead with `site:bbc.com` or `site:zhihu.com`.\n+\nThen find a sentence that contains the word written by a native Chinese, and understand the full sentence to confirm that it means what you want it to mean in a similar context.\n+\nJust using the Google translate directly will lead 70% to a weird/wrong/incomprehensible translation that no Chinese person would ever say.\n\nGood Chinese content to consume to learn:\n\n* 几分钟看完: illegal 10 minute summaries of movies with clips from the movies and a narrator speaking quickly instead of movie sounds.\n+\nSome have Chinese subtitles, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSMvtS6SYQ and it is great content to learn from, because it is someone telling a not too boring story in a natural and clear way, with supporting images to help with context.\n\n=== Chinese character sentence component mnemonic systems\n\nAssociate one word to each character/character component.\n\nOne good way to find mnemonics is to just Google for whatever random words you want to fit into a sentence. You end up learning fun things this way, and those make the best mnemonics.\n\nThen to learn a new character, break it down into components, and create a sentence or short story that includes all the component words.\n\n* <<characters>>: our own!!!!!\n* https://rtega.be/chmn/ CC-BY-NO-SA but not clear way to contribute to it\n* Proprietary books\n** https://www.amazon.com/dp/0824833236 \"Remembering Simplified Hanzi\" by James W.

So we just use the common phonetic compound **roots** (<<根>>) as the mnemonic. It was tempting to leave \"root\" for <<本>>, which looks perfectly like a root, but we did character first, and \"potato\" makes for even better mnemonics.\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<根>>\n\n[[冠]]\n==== 冠 (guan1, corona)\n\nMnemonic: when Queen Elizabeth was crowned, the **first** (<<元>>) thing they put a one **inch** (<<寸>>) **hajib** <<冖>> on her head, and then the **corona** of a Christian saint saint appeared on her head\n\nNotes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona\n\n[[禾]]\n==== 禾 (he2, grain)\n\nMnemonic: imagine **one** <<一>> **grain** of rice coming out of **wood** (<<木>>)\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<私>>\n* <<和>>\n\n[[和]]\n==== 和 (he2, harmonious)\n\nMnemonic: nothing is more **harmonious** than putting some **grains** <<禾>> in your **mouth** <<口>>\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<私>>\n* <<和>>\n\n[[很]]\n==== 很 (hen3, very)\n\nMnemonic: **stepping** (<<彳>>) on a tree **root** (<<艮>>) is a **very** bad idea, it might be a tree spirit that gets angry and eats you!\n\n[[火]]\n==== 火 (huo3, fire)\n\nShort forms: 灬\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<炎>>\n\n[[几]]\n==== 几 (ji3, side table)\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<殳>>\n\n[[交]]\n==== 交 (jiao1, exchange student)\n\nMnemonic: we measured **six** <<六>> American **exchange students** <<交>> on a **balance** <<乂>> to see which one was heaviest.

The traditional 臨 can be broken into: the **Prime minister** (<<臣>>) temporarily decided to increase production of an important **product** (<<品>>): **pistols** (<<top-part-of-每>>), until the zombie apocalypse would be over.\n\nWords:\n\n* <<临时>>\n\n[[仑]]\n==== 仑 (lun2, logic)\n\nMnemonic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory[spoon theory] is very logical and explains how using **spoons** (<<匕>>) is a good metaphor for a **person**'s (<<人>>) energy consumption\n\nCharacters:\n\n* <<论>>\n\n[[论]]\n==== 论 (lun4, rationale)\n\nMnemonic: \"**rationale**\" the fancy way that engineers **say** (<<言>>) \"**logic**\" (<<仑>>)\n\nWords:\n\n* <<理论>>\n\n[[轮]]\n==== 轮 (lun4, wheel)\n\nMnemonic: it is pretty **logical** (<<仑>>) that a **car** (<<车>>) needs **wheels**\n\nWords:\n\n* 法轮功: <<falun-gong>>\n\n[[没]]\n==== 没 (mei2, not have)\n\nMnemonic: if you **do not have** any **water** (<<水>>) for your **coffee** (<<殳>>), it won't be very good\n\n[[冖]]\n==== 冖 (mi4, hajib [Muslim female head scarf])\n\nNotes: the Wikipedia Kangxi is \"cloth cover\". Ciro guesses this was originally something to do with food covering. But let's just go with hajib which will allow for easy <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>> mnemonics. \"Crown\" from <<冠>> would also be another good one, but we had already used crown for
