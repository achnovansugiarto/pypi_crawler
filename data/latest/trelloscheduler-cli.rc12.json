    "description": "# trelloscheduler-cli\nBot for automating schedule management in Trello.  Intended use is to place the bot skeleton on a cloud server, set up commands with cron, and let it do \nits thing.\n\nPrimarily a personal project, but if you can use it by all means do.  \n\n## Pypi location:\nhttps://pypi.org/project/trelloscheduler-cli/1.0.0/\n\n## Supported features:\n1. buildweek - Builds the infrastructure (a \"Weekly Schedule\" board and \"Recycle Bin\" board) for the bot.\n2. startweek - Starts the week by adding empty lists with the day names and dates to the \"Weekly Schedule\" board.\n3. endweek - Archives the lists in \"Weekly Schedule\" by moving them to the \"Recycle Bin\" (AFAIK you can't delete boards through the API)\n4. loadweek - Loads a schedule file to add to the \"Weekly Schedule\" board.  Currently supports named days and numerical days.\n\n## Usage:\n\n*[Usage]*\n\n ``` trelloschedulercli [command : startweek OR buildweek OR endweek OR loadweek] [schedule file IF loadweek]```\n \n  Trello scheduler CLI is a command line interface used to automate tasks related to creating a weekly schedule in Trello.\n  All you need is a valid Trello account to access the various commands.\n  \n*[Commands]*\n\n  **buildweek**\n  \n  EX: ```trelloschedulercli buildweek```\n\n  Create a new weekly schedule board and recycle bin board.  They will show up as \"Weekly Schedule\"\n and \"Recycle Bin\" in Trello.\n  Does not need to be executed more than once.\n\n  **startweek**\n  \n  EX: ```trelloschedulercli startweek```\n\n  Starts a week by adding empty lists to the \"Weekly Schedule\" board.\n\n  **endweek**\n  \n  EX: ```trelloschedulercli endweek```\n\n  Archives all of the lists in the \"Weekly Schedule\" board.\n\n  **loadweek**\n  \n  EX: ```trelloschedulercli loadweek \"filename\"```\n\n  Loads a schedule file in JSON format into the \"Weekly Schedule\" board.\n  Currently supports named days and numerical days.\n\n## Installation:\n0. Install the Trello Scheduler CLI through pip as shown above.\n1.  Run ```nano ~/.bashrc``` to open up bash, then add the enivornment variables \"TRELLO_API_KEY\", \"TRELLO_API_SECRET\", and \"TRELLO_TOKEN\".  For more information on getting them, please see: http://www.trello.org/help.html\n3.  Run ```python3 trellobotrunner.py buildweek``` to create the necessary infrastructure.\n\n## Schedule.json File\n\nThe schedule file follows the following format in JSON:\n```\n\"tasks\": [\n     {\n          \"name\": \"task name\",    \n          \"description\": \"task description\",\n          \"day\": Either shorthand day names \"MoTuWeThFrSaSu\" or day numbers (for now)\n     }\n]\n```\nPlease see schedule.json for an example.\n\n## TODO:\n\n1.  Add more options for day parsing, ie multiple days for the same event both comma delimited and day ranges.\n2.   Add due dates for tasks.\n\n** These are not planned though, currently I don't need these features. **\n",
