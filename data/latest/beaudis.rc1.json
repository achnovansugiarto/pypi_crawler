    "description": "uploaded by TheAmmiR for personal use\nI don't claim anything, the work was done by @leovoel and contributors\n\nBeautifulDiscord\n================\n\nSimple Python script that adds CSS hot-reload to Discord.\n\n![demo gif](http://i.imgur.com/xq4HS5f.gif)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI wanted custom CSS injection for Discord, with no JavaScript add-ons or anything.\nThat's BeautifulDiscord.\n\nIf you want JS, you can either:\n- Use [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp)\n- Make your own thing!\n\nYou could also fork this repo and add it, it's not that big of a stretch.\nI just didn't add it because it's not what I want to do here.\n\n## Usage\n\nJust invoke the script when installed. If you don't pass the `--css` flag, the stylesheet\nwill be placed wherever the Discord app resources are found, which is not a very convenient\nlocation.\n\n**NOTE:** Discord has to be running for this to work in first place.\nThe script works by scanning the active processes and looking for the Discord ones.\n\n(yes, this also means you can fool the program into trying to apply this to some random program named Discord)\n\n```\n$ beautifuldiscord --css C:\\mystuff\\myown.css\n0: Found DiscordPTB.exe\n1: Found DiscordCanary.exe\nDiscord executable to use (number): 1\n\nDone!\n\nYou may now edit your C:\\mystuff\\myown.css file,\nwhich will be reloaded whenever it's saved.\n\nRelaunching Discord now...\n$\n```\n\nPass the `--revert` flag to restore Discord to its initial state. You can also do this manually if your Discord\ninstall gets screwed up, by first locating where Discord stores its resources:\n\n- On Windows, it's `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\discord[ptb,canary]\\<version>\\modules\\discord_desktop_core`\n- On OSX, it's `~/Library/Application Support/discord[ptb,canary]/<version>/modules/discord_desktop_core`\n- On Linux, it's `~/.config/discord[ptb,canary]/<version>/modules/discord_desktop_core`\n\n(`<...>` means it's required, `[...]` means it's optional)\n\nIn that folder, there should be four files, with `core.asar` and `original_core.asar` being the interesting ones.\nYou should then remove the existing `core.asar` and rename `original_core.asar` to `core.asar`.\n\n```\n$ beautifuldiscord --revert\n0: Found DiscordPTB.exe\n1: Found DiscordCanary.exe\nDiscord executable to use (number): 1\nReverted changes, no more CSS hot-reload :(\n$\n```\n\nYou can also run it as a package - i.e. `python3 -m beautifuldiscord` - if somehow you cannot\ninstall it as a script that you can run from anywhere.\n\n## Installing\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord/archive/master.zip\n```\n\nUsage of a virtual environment is recommended, to not pollute your global package space.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.x (no interest in compatibility with 2.x, untested on Python 3.x versions below 3.4)\n- `psutil` library: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil\n\nNormally, `pip` should install any required dependencies.\n\n## More GIFs\n\n![demo gif](http://i.imgur.com/w0bQOJ6.gif)\n\n\n",
