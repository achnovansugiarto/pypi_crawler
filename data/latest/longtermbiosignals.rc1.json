There's loads of more stuff to customize like sources, body locations, physical units, events, etc. Explore it in this [notebook](https://github.com/jomy-kk/IT-LongTermBiosignals/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb) ðŸ““ and in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jomy-kk/IT-LongTermBiosignals/wiki\">Wiki</a>.\n\n________\n\n#### Copyright Notice\n\nThere is no license for the content of this repository.\n\n2022, All rights reserved.
