    "description": "# Balaitous\n\nBalaitous is an updated version of the AI-severity model described in [Lassau et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20657-4).\n\nGiven an input CT scan, Balaitous outputs a probability for COVID disease and a probability for severe outcome, defined as intubation or death within one month.\n\nIt was trained on 2,000 patients from  the public [STOIC database](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2021210384) and achieved the best performance on an hold-out validation dataset of 800 patients during qualification phase of the [STOIC-2021 challenge](https://stoic2021.grand-challenge.org/) (see [leaderboard](https://stoic2021.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/quallification-last-submission/leaderboard/)). \n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install balaitous\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing the command line interface:\n```bash\nbalaitous --path path/to/image\n````\n\nor using python: \n```python\nfrom balaitous import Balaitous\n\nmodel = Balaitous()\np_covid, p_severe = model('path/to/image')\n```\n\nThe input image must be readable using the `SimpleITK.ReadImage` function (*e.g.* .nii or .mha file). If your input is a DICOM folder, you can convert it using tools such as [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).\n\n `PatientAge` and `PatientSex` metadata keys are automatically parsed from the input image. If not available, age (in years, *e.g.* 65) and sex (1 for male, 0 for female) can be optionnaly passed to Balaitous :\n\n```bash\nbalaitous --path /path/to/image --age age --sex sex\n```\n\nor:\n```python\np_covid, p_severe = model('path/to/image', age=age, sex=sex)\n```\n\n*Note: Balaitous runs much faster on GPU : 2-4 sec/sample on a GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti) compared to 2-4 min/sample on CPU (Intel i7, 8 cores).*\n\n## Model description\n\nThe processing steps of Balaitous (see `balaitous.py`) are the following : \n\n- The scan is resized to a pixel spacing of (1.5mm, 1.5mm, 5mm) and reshaped to a shape of (224, 224, Z)\n- A lung segmentation mask is obtained using a 2D U-Net ([source](https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask))\n- The scan is cropped to the slices containing the lungs\n- A first feature extractor is applied to get a first vector $X_{full}$\n- The lung mask is applied to the image (only lungs are now visible)\n- A second feature extractor is applied to get a second vector $X_{lung}$\n- For the severe outcome, 2 logistic regressions are applied to [$X_{full}$, age, sex] and [$X_{lung}$, age, sex] and the 2 probabilities are averaged \n- For the covid outcome, 2 logistic regressions are applied to $X_{full}$ and $X_{lung}$ and the 2 probabilities are averaged \n\nThe first feature extractor is a ViT-L model pretrained on ImageNet-22k using iBOT ([source](https://github.com/bytedance/ibot)) and finetuned for 35 epochs on 165k CT slices (4k patients from 7 public datasets). The second feature extractor is the same ViT-L model without finetuning. Model weights can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6547999#.Yn9QjJNBxSA).\n\nOnly the 4 logistic regressions were trained on the STOIC database, and only COVID positive patients were used to train the 2 logistic regressions for the prediction of severity. \n\n*Note : hyper-parameters and feature extractors have been choosen following cross-validation results on the public STOIC database (n=2,000 patients). Using the finetuned iBOT model on the plain image instead of the ImageNet model only brought modest performance gains.* \n\nIt is possible to get intermediate output variables from Balaitous using : \n\n```python\noutput_dict = model('path/to/image', return_dict=True)\n```\n\nThe main keys of this dictionnary are : \n- `unmasked_image`: array of the resized image with shape (224, 224, Z) and (1.5mm, 1.5mm, 5mm) pixel spacing\n- `mask`: boolean array of the lung mask \n- `image`: image with the lung mask applied\n- `features`: dictionnary of features from the unmasked image (key `full`) and from the masked image (key `lung`)\n- `prediction`: dictionnary of predictions for the 4 logistic regressions (keys `full_covid`, `lung_covid`, `full_severe`, `lung_severe`) and their weighted averages (keys `covid` and `severe`)\n\n*Note: Balaitous predictions are invariant to vertical image flips (see the iBOTExtractor class in `transforms.py`). \nSuch flips may happen depending on the DICOM conversion tools, so don't worry if `unmasked_image` and `image`  are flipped.*\n\n## Performances\n\nThe ROC-AUC performances (in %) of Balaitous are:\n\n|                       | AUC severity  | AUC covid      | \n| --                    | --            | --             | \n| Training - $X_{full}$  | 79.01 +- 2.63 | 80.65 +- 2.16  |\n| Training - $X_{lung}$ | 79.00 +- 3.30 | 82.63 +- 1.99  |\n| Training              | 80.36 +- 2.80 | 82.98 +- 2.01  |\n| Validation            | 80.44         | 83.22          |  \n\nThere were n=2,000 patients in the training dataset (n=1,205 COVID positive) and around n=800 patients in the validation dataset.\n\n Performances on the training dataset are computed using a stratified 4x8-fold cross-validation scheme. Following the STOIC-2021 challenge, the AUC for the severity prediction task is computed only among COVID positive patients. \n\n\n## Calibration\n\nCalibration has not been performed as the validation set has not been released.\n\n## Interpretability\n\nFor the severity prediction task, most of the false negatives are patients with low lung lesion burden but a severe outcome. On the opposite, most of the false positives are patients with high lung lesion burden but a positive outcome. This tends to indicate that the lung lesion burden is the main feature used by the model.\n\nMore investigation should be done to interpret Balaitous inner working. For instance, the $X_{full}$ features contain information that are external to the lung. Some can be predictive of a severe outcome such as patient body composition or heart condition, but they may also contain biases such as the presence of catheters if the patient was intubated before getting its CT scan. \n\n## License\n\nThis repository has been released under the MIT license.\n\n## Medical disclaimer\n\nThis repository is for the purpose of disseminating health information free of charge for the benefit of the public and research-sharing purposes only and is made available on the basis that no professional advice on a particular matter is being provided.
