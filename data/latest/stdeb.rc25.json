Automatic defaults are provided for the Debian package,\nbut many aspects of the resulting package can be customized (see the\ncustomizing section, below). An additional command, ``bdist_deb``,\ncreates a Debian binary package, a .deb file. The ``install_deb``\ncommand installs this .deb file. The ``debianize`` command builds a\n``debian/`` directory directly alongside your setup.py.\n\nSeveral convenience utilities are also provided:\n\n* ``pypi-download`` will query the `Python Package Index (PyPI)\n  <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ for a package and download it.\n* ``pypi-install`` will query the `Python Package Index (PyPI)\n  <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ for a package, download it, create a\n  .deb from it, and then install the .deb.\n* ``py2dsc`` will convert a distutils-built source tarball into a\n  Debian source package.\n* ``py2dsc-deb`` will convert a distutils-built source tarball into a\n  Debian source package and then use the Debian machinery to build a\n  .deb file from this.\n\n.. contents::\n\n\nPython 3 support\n----------------\n\nAs explained in more detail below, the heart of stdeb is the sdist_dsc\ndistutils command. This command runs once to generate a Debian source\npackage. This Debian source package can specify building packages for\nPython 2, Python 3, or both. Furthermore, this generation can be done\nwith the Python 2 or Python 3 interpreter. By default, only packages\nare built for the version of Python being used. To override this, use\n``--with-python2=True`` or ``--with-python3=True`` as an argument to\nthe sdist_dsc distutils command (or use both to be sure). For example,\nto build only a Python 3 package using the Python 3 interpreter::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb\n\nTo build both Python 2 and Python 3 packages using the Python 3\ninterpreter (and only the Python3 package installs scripts)::\n\n  python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command sdist_dsc --with-python2=True --with-python3=True --no-python2-scripts=True bdist_deb\n\nNews\n----\n\n * 2020-10-28: **Version 0.10.0**.

Tests pass\n   on Debian Squeeze (6), Debian Wheezy (7), and Ubuntu Precise\n   (12.04). Support for Python 3.4 (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty 14.04) was\n   mistakenly broken and was fixed in the 0.8.3 release.\n\n * 2014-8-14: **Version 0.8.2**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.2>`__. This is a bugfix\n   release fixing a serious issue that would cause a Python 2 package\n   to be built if only a Python 3 package was requested in some\n   circumstances.\n\n * 2014-8-10: **Version 0.8.1**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.1>`__. Due\n   to bugs in 0.8.0, this release is the first announced from the 0.8\n   series. Highlights since 0.7.1:\n\n   - Full support for Python 3. This includes being run from Python 3\n     and generating packages for Python 3. The default is to build\n     Python 3 packages when run with Python 3 and to build Python 2\n     packages when run from Python 2. Command line options can be used\n     to build packages for the other Python interpreter, too.\n\n   - Build .changes file for source package. While this still must be\n     signed for upload to a PPA, for example, it should still be\n     useful in some cases.\n\n   - Switch to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt). Practically speaking,\n     the .diff.gz file that used to come with a source package is now\n     replaced by a .debian.tar.gz file.\n\n   - Verify SSL certificates when talking to PyPI using\n     Requests. (Verification requires Requests >= 0.8.8.)\n\n   - Many bugfixes.\n\n * 2014-05-05: **Version 0.7.1**. See the `download page\n   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.7.1>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.7.1/CHANGELOG.txt>`__). Due\n   to bugs in 0.7.0, this release is the first announced from the 0.7\n   series. Highlights since 0.6.0:\n\n   - New commands: pypi-download and pypi-install to directly download\n     and install packages from PyPI, respectively. py2dsc-deb directly\n     creates a .deb file from a source tarball.\n\n   - New distutils command: install_deb lets you directly install a\n     python package as a standard system package.\n\n   - Many bugfixes, including the new URL for PyPI.\n\n   - Automated runs of test suite, thanks to Travis CI\n\n   - Thanks to many, especially Piotr Ożarowski for help with stdeb.\n\n * 2010-06-18: **Version 0.6.0**. See the `download page\n   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.6.0>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.6.0/CHANGELOG.txt>`__):\n\n   - A new ``debianize`` command to build a ``debian/`` directory\n     alongside your setup.py file.\n\n   - Bugfixes.\n\n * 2010-01-09: **Version 0.5.1**. Bugfix release. See the `download\n   page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.5.1>`__, the `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.1/CHANGELOG.txt>`__\n   and `release notes\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.1/RELEASE_NOTES.txt>`__.\n\n * 2009-12-30: **Version 0.5.0**. See the `download page\n   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.5.0>`__. Highlights for this\n   release (you may also wish to consult the full `changelog\n   <http://github.com/astraw/stdeb/blob/release-0.5.0/CHANGELOG.txt>`__):\n\n   - A new ``pypi-install`` script will automatically download, make a\n     .deb, and install packages from the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_.\n\n   - Removal of the setuptools dependency.\n\n   - New option (`--guess-conflicts-provides-replaces`) to query\n     original Debian packages for Conflicts/Provides/Replaces\n     information.\n\n   - As a result of these changes and to fix a couple bugs/warts, some\n     minor backwards incompatible changes and deprecations were\n     made.

Specifically,\nyou could include this in your ``~/.pydistutils.cfg`` file::\n\n  [global]\n  command-packages: stdeb.command\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThese all assume you have stdeb installed in your system Python\npath. stdeb also works from a non-system Python path (e.g. a\n`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_).\n\nQuickstart 1: Install something from PyPI now, I don't care about anything else\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nDo this from the command line::\n\n  pypi-install mypackage\n\n**Warning: Despite doing its best, there is absolutely no way stdeb\ncan guarantee all the Debian package dependencies will be properly\nfulfilled without manual intervention. Using pypi-install bypasses\nyour ability to customize stdeb's behavior. Read the rest of this\ndocument to understand how to make better packages.**\n\nQuickstart 2: Just tell me the fastest way to make a .deb\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n(First, install stdeb as you normally install Python packages.)\n\nDo this from the directory with your `setup.py` file::\n\n  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb\n\nThis will make a Debian source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz and\n.diff.gz files) and then compile it to a Debian binary package (.deb)\nfor your current system. The result will be in ``deb_dist``.\n\n**Warning: installing the .deb file on other versions of Ubuntu or\nDebian than the one on which it was compiled will result in undefined\nbehavior. If you have extension modules, they will probably\nbreak. Even in the absence of extension modules, bad stuff will likely\nhappen.**\n\nFor this reason, it is much better to build the Debian source package\nand then compile that (e.g. using `Ubuntu's PPA`__) for each target\nversion of Debian or Ubuntu.\n\n__ https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\n\nQuickstart 3: I read the warning, so show me how to make a source package, then compile it\n``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nThis generates a source package::\n\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  py2dsc Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n\nThis turns it into a .deb using the standard Debian tools. (Do *this*\non the same source package for each target distribution)::\n\n  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0/\n  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us\n\nThis installs it::\n\n  cd ..\n  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb\n\nQuickstart 4: Install from a Python package direct to a debian system package\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n(First, install stdeb as you normally install Python packages.)\n\nDo this from the directory with your `setup.py` file::\n\n  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command install_deb\n\nThis will make a Debian source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz and\n.diff.gz files), compile it to a Debian binary package (.deb) for your\ncurrent system and then install it using ``dpkg``.\n\n\nAnother example, with more explanation\n``````````````````````````````````````\n\nThis example is more useful if you don't have a Python source package\n(.tar.gz file generated by ``python setup.py sdist``). For the sake of\nillustration, we do download such a tarball, but immediately unpack it\n(alternatively, use a version control system to grab the unpacked\nsource of a package)::\n\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/Reindent/Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  tar xzf Reindent-0.1.0.tar.gz\n  cd Reindent-0.1.0\n\nThe following will generate a directory ``deb_dist`` containing the\nfiles ``reindent_0.1.0-1.dsc``, ``reindent_0.1.0.orig.tar.gz`` and\n``reindent_0.1.0-1.diff.gz``, which, together, are a debian source\npackage::\n\n  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command sdist_dsc\n\nThe source generated in the above way is also extracted (using\n``dpkg-source -x``) and placed in the ``deb_dist`` subdirectory. To\ncontinue the example above::\n\n  cd deb_dist/reindent-0.1.0\n  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us\n\nFinally, the generated package can be installed::\n\n  cd ..\n  sudo dpkg -i python-reindent_0.1.0-1_all.deb\n\nFor yet another example of use, with still more explanation, see\n`allmydata-tahoe ticket 251`_.\n\n.. _allmydata-tahoe ticket 251: http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/ticket/251\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nFiles are available at the `download page`_ (for ancient releases, see\nthe `old download page`_).\n\n.. _download page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb\n.. _old download page: http://stdeb.python-hosting.com/wiki/Download\n\nThe git repository is available at\nhttp://github.com/astraw/stdeb\n\nInstall (or, using stdeb to create an stdeb installer)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor a bit of fun, here's how to install stdeb using stdeb. Note that\nstdeb is also in Debian and Ubuntu, so this recipe is only necessary\nto install a more recent stdeb.\n\n::\n\n  STDEB_VERSION=\"0.10.0\"\n\n  # Download stdeb\n  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/stdeb/stdeb-$STDEB_VERSION.tar.gz\n\n  # Extract it\n  tar xzf stdeb-$STDEB_VERSION.tar.gz\n\n  # Enter extracted source package\n  cd stdeb-$STDEB_VERSION\n\n  # Build .deb (making use of stdeb package directory in sys.path).\n  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb\n\n  # Install it\n  sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python-stdeb_$STDEB_VERSION-1_all.deb\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nFor the average Python package, its source distribution\n(python_package.tar.gz created with ``python setup.py sdist``)\ncontains nearly everything necessary to make a Debian source\npackage. This near-equivalence encouraged me to write this distutils\nextension, which executes the setup.py file to extract relevant\ninformation. `setuptools\n<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_ may optionally\nbe used.\n\nI wrote this initially to Debianize several Python packages of my own,\nbut I have the feeling it could be generally useful. It appears\nsimilar, at least in theory, to easydeb_, `Logilab's Devtools`_,\nbdist_dpkg_, bdist_deb_, pkgme_ and `dh-virtualenv\n<https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv>`__.\n\n.. _easydeb: http://easy-deb.sourceforge.net/\n.. _Logilab's DevTools: http://www.logilab.org/projects/devtools\n.. _bdist_dpkg: http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/Lib/bdist_dpkg.py\n.. _bdist_deb: http://bugs.python.org/issue1054967\n.. _pkgme: https://launchpad.net/pkgme\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Create a package for all Python versions supported by\n  python-support. (Limiting this range is possible with the\n  ``XS-Python-Version:`` config option.)\n\n* Automatic conversion of Python package names into valid Debian\n  package names.\n\n* Attempt to automatically convert version numbers such that ordering\n  is maintained. See also the config option\n  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``.\n\n* Fine grained control of version numbers. (``Debian-Version``,\n  ``Forced-Upstream-Version``, ``Upstream-Version-Prefix``,\n  ``Upstream-Version-Suffix`` config options.)\n\n* Install .desktop files. (``MIME-Desktop-Files`` config option.)\n\n* Install .mime and .sharedmimeinfo files. (``MIME-File`` and\n  ``Shared-MIME-File`` config options.)\n\n* Install copyright files. (``Copyright-File`` config option.)\n\n* Apply patches to upstream sources. (``Stdeb-Patch-File`` config\n  option.)\n\n* Pass environment variables to setup.py script. (``Setup-Env-Vars``\n  config option.)\n\nCustomizing the produced Debian source package (config options)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nstdeb will attempt to provide reasonable defaults, but these are only\nguesses.\n\nThere are two ways to customize the Debian source package produced by\nstdeb. First, you may provide options to the distutils\ncommands. Second, you may provide an ``stdeb.cfg`` file.\n\nstdeb distutils command options\n```````````````````````````````\n\nThe sdist_dsc command takes command-line options to the distutils\ncommand. For example::\n\n  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command sdist_dsc --debian-version 0MyName1\n\nThis creates a Debian package with the Debian version set to\n\"0MyName1\".\n\nThese options can also be set via distutils configuration\nfiles. (These are the ``setup.cfg`` file alongside ``setup.py`` and\nthe ~/.pydistutils.cfg file.) In that case, put the arguments in the\n``[sdist_dsc]`` section. For example, a project's ``~/.setup.cfg``\nfile might have this::\n\n  [sdist_dsc]\n  debian-version: 0MyName1\n\nTo pass these commands to sdist_dsc when calling bdist_deb, do this::\n\n  python setup.py sdist_dsc --debian-version 0MyName1 bdist_deb\n\n====================================== =========================================\n        Command line option                      Effect\n====================================== =========================================\n  --with-python2                       build Python 2 package (default=True)\n  --with-python3                       build Python 3 package (default=False)\n  --no-python2-scripts                 disable installation of Python 2 scripts (default=False)\n  --no-python3-scripts                 disable installation of Python 3 scripts (default=False)\n  --force-x-python3-version            Override default minimum python3:any\n                                       dependency with value from x-python3-\n                                       version\n  --allow-virtualenv-install-location  Allow installing into\n                                       /some/random/virtualenv-path\n  --with-dh-virtualenv                 Build the package using dh_virtualenv, so all dependencies\n                                       are embedded into the packages.\n  --with-dh-systemd                    Add the systemd addon that will add dh_systemd_enable and\n                                       dh_systemd_start helpers at the correct time during build.\n  --sign-results                       Use gpg to sign the resulting .dsc and\n                                       .changes file\n  --dist-dir (-d)                      directory to put final built\n                                       distributions in (default='deb_dist')\n  --patch-already-applied (-a)         patch was already applied (used when\n                                       py2dsc calls sdist_dsc)\n  --default-distribution               deprecated (see --suite)\n  --compat                             debian compatibility level (default=9)\n  --suite (-z)                         distribution name to use if not\n                                       specified in .cfg (default='unstable')\n  --default-maintainer                 deprecated (see --maintainer)\n  --maintainer (-m)                    maintainer name and email to use if not\n                                       specified in .cfg (default from\n                                       setup.py)\n  --extra-cfg-file (-x)                additional .cfg file (in addition to\n                                       stdeb.cfg if present)\n  --patch-file (-p)                    patch file applied before setup.py\n                                       called (incompatible with file\n                                       specified in .cfg)\n  --patch-level (-l)                   patch file applied before setup.py\n                                       called (incompatible with file\n                                       specified in .cfg)\n  --patch-posix (-q)                   apply the patch with --posix mode\n  --remove-expanded-source-dir (-r)    remove the expanded source directory\n  --ignore-install-requires (-i)       ignore the requirements from\n                                       requires.txt in the egg-info directory\n  --ignore-source-changes              ignore all changes on source when\n                                       building source package (add -i.*\n                                       option to dpkg-source)\n  --no-backwards-compatibility         This option has no effect, is here for\n                                       backwards compatibility, and may be\n                                       removed someday.\n  --guess-conflicts-provides-replaces  If True, attempt to guess\n                                       Conflicts/Provides/Replaces in\n                                       debian/control based on apt-cache\n                                       output.

Passing the arguments this way (either on the\ncommand line, or in the ``[sdist_dsc]`` section of a distutils .cfg\nfile) will take precedence. The option name should be given in lower\ncase.\n\nstdeb.cfg configuration file\n````````````````````````````\n\nYou may write config files of the format understood by `ConfigParser\n<http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html>`_. When building\neach package, stdeb looks for the existence of a ``stdeb.cfg`` in the\ndirectory with ``setup.py``. You may specify an additional config file\nwith the command-line option --extra-cfg-file. The section should\nshould either be [DEFAULT] or [package_name], which package_name is\nspecified as the name argument to the setup() command. An example\nstdeb.cfg file is::\n\n  [DEFAULT]\n  Depends: python-numpy\n  XS-Python-Version: >= 2.6\n\nAll available options:\n\n====================================== =========================================\n  Config file option                     Effect\n====================================== =========================================\n  Source                               debian/control Source: (Default:\n                                       <source-debianized-setup-name>)\n  Package                              debian/control Package: (Default:\n                                       python-<debianized-setup-name>)\n  Package3                             debian/control Package: for python3\n                                       (Default:\n                                       python3-<debianized-setup-name>)\n  Suite                                suite (e.g. stable, lucid) in changelog\n                                       (Default: unstable)\n  Suite3                               suite (e.g. stable, lucid) for python3\n                                       (Default: uses value of Suite option)\n  Maintainer                           debian/control Maintainer: (Default:\n                                       <setup-maintainer-or-author>)\n  Debian-Version                       debian version (Default: 1)\n  Section                              debian/control Section: (Default:\n                                       python)\n  Epoch                                version epoch\n  Forced-Upstream-Version              forced upstream version\n  Upstream-Version-Prefix              upstream version prefix\n  Upstream-Version-Suffix              upstream version suffix\n  Uploaders                            uploaders\n  Copyright-File                       copyright file\n  Build-Depends                        debian/control Build-Depends:\n  Build-Conflicts                      debian/control Build-Conflicts:\n  Stdeb-Patch-File                     file containing patches for stdeb to\n                                       apply\n  Stdeb-Patch-Level                    patch level provided to patch command\n  Depends                              debian/control Depends:\n  Depends3                             debian/control Depends: for python3\n  Suggests                             debian/control Suggests:\n  Suggests3                            debian/control Suggests: for python3\n  Recommends                           debian/control Recommends:\n  Recommends3                          debian/control Recommends: for python3\n  XS-Python-Version                    debian/control XS-Python-Version:\n  X-Python3-Version                    debian/control X-Python3-Version:\n  Dpkg-Shlibdeps-Params                parameters passed to dpkg-shlibdeps\n  Conflicts                            debian/control Conflicts:\n  Conflicts3                           debian/control Conflicts: for python3\n  Breaks                               debian/control Breaks:\n  Breaks3                              debian/control Breaks: for python3\n  Provides                             debian/control Provides:\n  Provides3                            debian/control Provides: for python3\n  Replaces                             debian/control Replaces:\n  Replaces3                            debian/control Replaces: for python3\n  MIME-Desktop-Files                   MIME desktop files\n  MIME-File                            MIME file\n  Shared-MIME-File                     shared MIME file\n  Setup-Env-Vars                       environment variables passed to\n                                       setup.py\n  Udev-Rules                           file with rules to install to udev\n  Python2-Depends-Name                 override Python 2 Debian package name in\n                                       ${python:Depends}\n====================================== =========================================\n\nThe option names in stdeb.cfg files are not case sensitive.\n\nReproducible builds\n-------------------\n\nBy default stdeb uses the current time for the the timestamp in the generated\nchangelog file. This results in a non-reproducible build since every invocation\ngenerates a different changelog / ``.deb``.\nThe environment variable ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` can be set to a fixed timestamp\n(e.g. when the version was tagged or of the last commit was made) which will be\nused in the changelog instead. This will ensure that the produced ``.deb`` is\nreproducible on repeated invocations.\n\nFor more information about reproducible builds and this specific environment\nvariable please see https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n * Python 2.7 or Python 3.x\n * Standard Debian utilities such as ``date``, ``dpkg-source`` and\n   Debhelper 7 (use stdeb 0.3.x if you need to support older\n   distributions without dh7)\n * If your setup.py uses the setuptools features ``setup_requires`` or\n   ``install_requires``, you must run ``apt-file update`` prior to\n   running any stdeb command.\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Make output meet `Debian Python Policy`_ specifications or the `new\n  python policy`_. This will include several things, among which are:\n\n  - the ability to make custom changelogs\n  - the ability to include project-supplied documentation as a -doc package\n  - include license information in debian/copyright\n  - the ability to include project-supplied examples, tests, and data\n    as a separate package\n  - much more not listed\n\n* Create (better) documentation\n\n* Log output using standard distutils mechanisms\n\n* Refactor the source code to have a simpler, more sane design\n\n.. _debian python policy: http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/\n.. _new python policy: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPython/NewPolicy\n\nCall for volunteers\n-------------------\n\nI don't have a lot of time for this. This project stands a very real\nchance of being only a shadow of its potential self unless people step\nup and contribute. There are numerous ways in which people could\nhelp. In particular, I'd be interested in finding a co-maintainer or\nmaintainer if the project generates any interest. Secondarily, I would\nappreciate advice from Debian developers or Ubuntu MOTUs about the\narcane details of Python packaging.\n\nMailing list\n------------\n\nPlease address all questions to the distutils-SIG_\n\n.. _distutils-SIG: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT-style license.
