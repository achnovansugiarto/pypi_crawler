Clone this repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rizwanmustafa/Rizpass.git\ncd Rizpass\n```\n\n\n2. Create a new virtual environment in a folder called 'venv' for this project (This will prevent your binary size and compilation time from being too long).\n```bash\npython3 -m venv venv\n```\n\n3. Activate the virtual environment:\n```bash\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n4. Install the package\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n5. Start Rizpass\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass\n```\nNote: You can also start rizpass by executing `rizpass` in the terminal directly however this may require modification to the `$PATH` variable\n\n\nBonus - If you want to do it all in one step:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rizwanmustafa/Rizpass.git\ncd Rizpass\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install .\npython3 -m rizpass\n```\n\n## But I really really need a binary\nSo you want to use Rizpass on the go. \nSince python doesn't have an official compiler we are going to rely on one of it's module called `PyInstaller`.\n\n1. Follow the steps in the [Installation through Github](#installation-through-github)\n\n2. Install `PyInstaller`:\n```bash\npip install PyInstaller\n```\n\n3. In the same virtual environment that we created, run the following command while in the root directory of the package:\n```\npython3 -m PyInstaller --onefile rizpass.py\n```\n\n4. Upon completion, this will create a binary file for your OS which will be located in  `dist/`\n\nCongratulations, you now have a huge sized binary\n\n## Running tests\nIt is recommended that you run tests after installation to ensure the best experience. You can run all unit tests through the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass.tests\n```\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nConfiguring Rizpass is as simple as running the following command and answering the questions asked\n\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass --setup\n```\n\n## Configuration File\nRizpass uses a json object for storing its configuration. The setup command creates a configuration file at `~/.rizpass.json`  \nHere is a list of the fields contained in the configuration file and their description:\n```\ndb_type (string, Required) : Name of the database. 'mysql' for MySQL or MariaDB and 'mongo' for MongoDB.\ndb_host (string, Required) : Address at which the database is hosted e.g 'localhost'\ndb_name (string, Required) : Name of the database created specifically for Rizpass to store your credentials in.\ndb_user (string, Required) : Name of the database user created specifically for Rizpass (Should have read and write permissions on the database).\ndb_port (integer, Optional): Port number for communication with the database. Defaults to 3306 for 'mysql' and 27017 for 'mongo'.\n```\n\n#### Sample Configuration File\n\n```json\n{\"db_type\": \"mongo\", \"db_host\": \"localhost\", \"db_user\": \"passMan\", \"db_name\": \"rizpass\", \"db_port\": 7000}\n```\n\n## Overriding configuration at runtime\nYou can override the configurations stored in a file on runtime using the following cli options:\n```\n--db-host <host>        Database host\n--db-type <type>        Database type (mongo, mysql)\n--db-user <user>        Database user\n--db-name <name>        Database name\n--db-port <port>        Database port\n```\n\nYou can also use all these options together to use Rizpass without a configuration file.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Execution\n\nYou can execute Rizpass through the following commmand:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass\n```\n\n## Menu Items\n\n#### Generate a strong password\nThis menu item allows one to generate a strong password that contains all kinds of characters (uppercase, lowercase, special, digit) to enhance security. The generated passwords stand strong against dictionary attacks as they are truly random and not easy to guess. In this option the minimum length of a generated password can be 16 characters\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass generate-strong\n```\n\n#### Generate a password\nThis menu item allows one to generate a password with the traits of their choice. The user can choose the length and the type of characters they want to include in the generated password. This option is less secure than the option mentioned above but allows for greater customizability.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass generate\n```\n\n#### Add a credential\nThis menu items allows one to store a new credential. Users can store the credential data in the following fields: 'title', 'username', 'email' and 'password'. Rizpass automatically adds a unique 'id' field to the credential for use in other menu items\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass add\n```\n\n#### Retrieve credential using id\nThis menu item takes the 'id' of a credential as an input from the user and prints the credential if it exists.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass retrieve\n```\n\n#### Copy credential to clipboard\nThis menu item takes the 'id' of a credential as an input from the user and copies the password to the clipboard if it exists. For this menu item to work, pyperclip must be able to find a copy mechanism for your system.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass copy\n```\n\n#### Filter credentials\nThis menu item allows the users to provide 'filters' for the following fields: 'title', 'username', 'email'. A 'filter' for a field is just character(s) that each credential's matching field must contain. If no 'filter' is provided for a particular field, all values for that field will be considered valid. If no 'filters' are provided at all, all stored credentials will be returned.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass filter\n```\n\n#### List all credentials\nThis menu item prints all the stored credentials to the screen.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass list-all\n```\n\n#### Modify credential\nThis menu item takes the credential 'id' as an input. It then takes in replacement values for each field for that credential. If a replacement value for a field is empty, the field value will not be modified.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass modify\n```\n\n#### Remove credential\nThis menu item takes the credential 'id' as an input and removes the stored credential if it exists.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass remove\n```\n\n#### Remove all credentials\nThis menu item first confirms if you are sure about what you intend to do. It then prompts you to re enter the master password, if the master password is incorrect, it exits, else it removes all stored credentials. Remember this is a permanent change.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass remove-all\n```\n\n#### Change master password\nThis menu item changes the master password you use to log in to Rizpass. It first confirms your intentions and then prompts you for the current master password. If incorrect, it exits, else it continues with the process. It then asks you for the new master password. If you are using the database option, it will ask for the root credentials to change the password of the database user. It then re-encrypts the stored credentials using the new master password. Remember this is a permanent change.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass change-master-pass\n```\n\n#### Export credentials to a JSON file\nThis menu item allows you to export your encrypted credentials to a JSON file to allow for portability. It will ask you for the file path and the master password for this file. You can choose a separate master password for the exported credentials but if you do not provide a separate master password, it will encrypt the credentials with your current master password. You can then use this file with the file mode of Rizpass to access your credentials on the go.\n\nWe recommend you use this feature to backup your credentials regularly. It is also recommended to store this file in a safe place.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass export\n```\n\n#### Import credentials from a JSON file\nThis menu item allows you to import your encrypted credentials from a JSON file that was exported using the export menu item of Rizpass. Rizpass will prompt you to provide the path of the file and the master password for this file when you try to import it. It will then try to re-encrypt all credentials in the file and store them.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass import\n```\n\n#### List all raw credentials\nThis menu item is similar to the \"List all credentials\" menu item but there is one key difference. It prints the encrypted version of the stored credentials on the screen rather than the usual decrypted version of the credentials.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass list-raw\n```\n\n#### Password checkup\nThis menu item goes over your stored credentials and scans for passwords that are either weak or duplicate. For detecting weak passwords, it jsut checks if a password follows the guidlines that this item prints before beginning the checkup. It is completely possible for this item to miss weak passwords like \"p@$$w0rdp@$$w0rd123\". Hence this is why it is recommended to use passwords generated from the \"Genearate a strong password\" menu item.\n\nYou can access this feature through the commandline by the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass pass-checkup\n```\n\n## File Mode\n\nA major reason behind the creation of Rizpass was to have ease of use and to prevent confusion among the users. Rizpass supports file mode whereby all operations are performed on a JSON file instead of a database. This can help those who don't want to go through the process of setting up a database and those who want portability\n\nYou can access the file mode using the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass --file <file_name>\n```\n\n## Actions\nSince Rizpass is a CLI tool, it is designed to be as cli-friendly as possible. Hence, if you don't like the extensive menu and know exactly what you want to do, you can use actions. For example if you want to add a credential, you can do so through the terminal:\n```\npython3 -m rizpass add\n```\nPlus you can use this feature to perform multiple tasks in one go without touching the menu:\n```\npython3 -m rizpass add list-all generate-strong pass-checkup\n```\nHowever with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n## Other\n\nYou can print the help menu through the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass --help\n```\n\nYou can print the version of Rizpass you are using through the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass --version\n```\n\nYou can have verbose output through the following command:\n```bash\npython3 -m rizpass --verbose\n```\n",
