    "description": "\n# Proximity Operator Repository \n\nProximity operators have become increasingly important tools as basic \nbuilding blocks of proximal splitting algorithms, a class of algorithms \nthat decompose complex composite convex optimization methods into simple \nsteps involving one of the functions present in the model. This package provides\nimplementations of the proximity operator of various\nfunctions (function of scalar variable or multivariate,convex and non-convex functions, \nindicator functions...). \n\nFor more information see the [full project](http://proximity-operator.net/) containing technical details, a tutorial and code implantation in matlab.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install package (require python 3.8.0 or a later version):\n\n    pip install proxop\n\nTo update, one should add the option \"--upgrade\":\n\n    pip install proxop --upgrade\n\n## How to use it ?\n\nTo import the package:\n\n    import proxop\n\nPlease visit our [website](http://proximity-operator.net/)  for more tutorial and more details.\n\n## Examples:\n\nEvaluates the function 'AbsValue':\n    >>> import proxop\n    >>> proxop.AbsValue()(-3)\n    3\n\nUse a scale factor 'gamma':\n    >>> proxop.AbsValue(gamma=2)(-3)\n    6\n\nWhen the input is a vector, the result is the sum of the outputs obtained by applying the function to each element :\n\n     >>> from proxop import AbsValue\n     >>> import numpy as np\n     >>> AbsValue()( np.array([-1, 2, 3., -4.]) )\n     10.0\n  \nCompute the proximity operator by using the method 'prox' :\n\n    >>> AbsValue().prox( 3)\n    2\n    >>> AbsValue().prox(np.array([ -3., 1., 6., 3.]))\n    array([-2.,  0.,  5., 2.])\n\n\nUse a scale factor 'gamma'>0 to commute the proximity operator of  th function \"gamma*f\" :\n\n    >>> AbsValue(gamma=2).prox([ -3., 1., 6.])\n     array([-1.,  0.,  4.])\n\n## Example 2: Projection onto a set\nSince proximity operator is a generalization of the notion of projection onto a (convex) set,\none can easily interpret the result with an indicator function. For example, the affine barrier is defined as:\n\n                       / -log(b- a.T*x)    if u.T*x < b\n                f(x) =|\n                       \\   + inf            otherwise\n\n\n     >>> import numpy as np\n     >>> from proxop import AffineBarrier\n     >>>\n     >>> x=np.array([1,2,3])\n     >>> a= np.array([-1, 5, 3])\n     >>> b= 3.5\n     >>> AffineBarrier(a,b)(x)\n     inf  \n\nThe result below is infinite, which means 'x' does not belong to the affine set.\n\nProjection of 'x' onto the affine set:\n\n     >>> px= AffineBarrier(x,b).prox(x) \n     >>> px\n     >>> AffineBarrier(a,b)(px)\n     0.61828190224889\n\nAs expected, the result is finite, meaning the projection of 'x' belongs to the affine set.\n\n## Example 3: Matrix variable\n\n     >>> x=np.arange(6)\n     >>> x=x.reshape((2,3))\n     >>> x\n     array([[0, 1, 2],\n           [3, 4, 5]])\n     >>> a =np.ones_like(x)\n     >>> a[0,:]=2\n     >>> a\n     array([[2., 2., 2.],\n            [1., 1., 1.]])\n     >>> b=np.array([-1, 2, 4])\n\nSet 'axis=0' to process along the rows of the matrix 'x' (note the dimension of 'b'\nmust be compatible with the shape of 'x'):\n\n     >>> AffineBarrier(a,b, axis=0)(x)\n     inf\n\n Projection of x onton the affine set:\n\n     >>> px = AffineBarrier(a,b, axis=0).prox(x)  \n     >>> AffineBariier(x,b, axis=0)(px)\n      0.157704693902156\n",
