The app is primarily\nbuilt with ``Flask``, but ``Celery`` handles CPU-intensive background tasks, such as compressing pdf files.\nThis is mostly a toy project for me to learn Flask, but someone, somewhere may find it\nuseful someday. Currently, the features include uploading pdf files, compressing them, and\nhaving them sent to a pre-configured e-mail address.\n\nRequirements\n============\nAside from the Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`_, the following requirements must be\nmet:\n\n* ``Python 3.6``\n    - Strictly speaking, 3.5 should also work fine, but the tests use 3.6 features so the\n      build is only tested for 3.6.\n* ``Ghostscript``\n    - ``pdfebc-core`` requires ``Ghostscript`` for the PDF compression. The default binary is ``gs``,\n      but this can be specified in the configuration file.\n* ``Redis``\n    - Celery requires a message broker, and I chose to go with ``Redis``.\n* A Gmail account (for sending e-mails)\n    - By default, ``pdfebc`` uses Google's SMTP server to send e-mails. The program can however\n      be configured to use any SMTP server by maniupulating the ``config.cnf``.\n\nInstall\n=======\nOption 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``\n----------------------------------------\nThe latest release of ``pdfebc-web`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.\nI strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this\nmay land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install\ncan be done like this:\n\n1. Execute ``pip install --user pdfebc-web`` to install the package.\n2. Install ``Redis`` (used by ``Celery``).\n    - This may or may not be available in your package manager, Google it for specifics!\n3. Install ``Ghostscript``.\n    - Many distributions come with ``Ghostscript`` pre-installed, but you may need to install\n      it.\n    - Make note of what the binary is called, and enter it in the configuration file\n      (see the next step).\n4. Currently, you must add the configuration file manually. Please have a look at the\n   `sample configuration`_ file for details. Where to put the configuration file is\n   machine-dependent, and decided by the ``appdirs`` package.\n   On most modern Linux distributions, the file should be put at ``$HOME/.config/pdfebc/config.cnf``.\n   You can run ``apdirs.user_config_dir('pdfebc')`` in the Python interpreter to find the \n   correct directory for your machine.\n   Note that you must first import ``appdirs`` for it to be available in the interpreter.\n\n   **Note:** When using a Gmail account, I strongly recommend\n   using an `App password`_ instead of the actual account password.\n\nOption 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded\nto PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.\n\n1. Clone the repo with ``git``:\n    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/pdfebc-web``\n2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.\n    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.\n    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.\n    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.\n3. Install ``Redis`` (used by ``Celery``).\n    - This may or may not be available in your package manager, Google it for specifics!\n4. Install ``Ghostscript``.\n    - Many distributions come with ``Ghostscript`` pre-installed, but you may need to install\n      it.\n    - Make note of what the binary is called, and enter it in the configuration file\n      (see the next step).\n5. Currently, you must add the configuration file manually. Please have a look at the\n   `sample configuration`_ file for details. Where to put the configuration file is\n   machine-dependent, and decided by the ``appdirs`` package. Run \n   ``apdirs.user_config_dir('pdfebc')`` in the Python interpreter to find the correct directory.\n   Note that you must first import ``appdirs`` for it to be available in the interpreter.\n   **Note:** When using a Gmail account, I strongly recommend\n   using an `App password`_ instead of the actual account password.\n   \nHow to run\n==========\nAssuming everything is installed correctly, running the application is dead simple.\n\n1. Execute ``pdfebc-web-start-celery-redis`` to start up the ``Redis`` server and 4 ``Celery``\n   workers. The script will complain if ``Redis`` or ``Celery`` is not installed.\n2. Execute ``pdfebc-web runserver -h x.x.x.x -p n`` to run ``pdfebc-web`` while listening\n   to address ``x.x.x.x`` and port ``n``. Do note that if you run the server as root,\n   for example if you want to run it on a port lower than 1000,\n   then ``appdirs`` will likely look for a different configuration directory than if you\n   run it as your normal user (because root is a different user).\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.

At this point, this is a practice project for me,\nand even if I were looking for outside help the test suite is nowhere near comprehensive enough\nfor that yet.
