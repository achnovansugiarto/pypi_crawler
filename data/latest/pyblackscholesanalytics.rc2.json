    "description": "# pyBlackScholesAnalytics\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/master) [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/tree/master/) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyBlackScholesAnalytics.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyBlackScholesAnalytics)\n\n[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) is a Python package implementing analytics for options and option strategies under the Black-Scholes Model for educational purposes.\n\n# Summary <a name=\"Summary\"></a>\n\n[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) package is a Python package designed to use the well known Black-Scholes model \nto evaluate price, P&L and greeks of European options (both plain-vanilla and simple equity exotics \nsuch as cash-or-nothing Digital options), as well as simple option strategies built on them.\n\nThe package has been developed as a spin-off project of the [\"IT for Business and Finance\"](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20) class held at the University of Siena for the Master degree in Finance in 2020.\n\n[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) places itself in the middle between the coding style and level of a master student and that required for a junior quant at an investment bank. The aim is to address the gap between the two providing a playground \nfor students to master financial concepts related to options and option strategies and implementing a dedicated comprehensive\nobject-oriented architecture.\n\nThe package itself tries to follow the style guide for Python code [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Intentional as well as unintentional departures from this style may occur in code. I'd like to thank in advance anyone who will make me aware of possible improvements in style and clarity of code. \n\n# Installation <a name=\"Installation\"></a>\n\nYou can install [**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) simply typing \n\n`pip install pyBlackScholesAnalytics`\n\nLatest version of the package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/). If you encounter problems during installation please share with me.\n\n# Components <a name=\"Components\"></a>\n\nThe current version of the package features the following components:\n\n- `options`: definitions for `EuropeanOption` abstract base-class as well \nas `PlainVanillaOption` and `DigitalOption` derived classes\n\n- `portfolio`: definition of `Portfolio` class implementing analytics for portfolios of options\n\n- `plotter`: definitions for `Plotter` abstract base-class as well \nas `OptionPlotter` and `PortfolioPlotter` derived classes\n\n- `utils`: definition of general utility functions\n\n- `numeric_routines`: definition of `NumericGreeks` class implementing option greeks through finite-difference methods\n\n# Resources <a name=\"Resources\"></a>\n\nAs far as the educational purpose is concerned, I find the [**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) package itself helpful as much as the way in which its final version can be progressively built. In my experience, the constructive approach is ubiquitous in the real life of a Quant/Strat: a business need is first formulated by a trader or another stakeholder, then tackled by the Quant/Strat team with an _ad hoc_ analysis, then a tactic short-term implementation of the response is produced and, finally, a strategic and robust long-term solution is designed and implemented. For this reason, the package is complemented by a series of 4 Tutorials in the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/tree/master/Notebook_Tutorials) and [Youtube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC77o5i2ePrXjwlQQLQeYsBw/playlists). These tutorial aim to present the package step-by step in a constructive way building on the ideas of the Object-Oriented paradygm as improvements over sequential implementations of the same financial concepts. \n\nMoreover several [examples](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/tree/master/examples) showcase the features of [**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) package and can be used as entry-point to begin the exploration of the package.\n\n## Tutorials <a name=\"Tutorials\"></a>\n\nJupyter Notebook are made interactive thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (click on the badge here below and start playing with the notebooks from your web browser)!\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/master)\n\n|  | Jupyter Notebook | Youtube Video Playlist |\n|:-------------------|:--------------------------:|:------------------:|\n| **Derivatives Analytics - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming**: in this tutorial we introduce _Object-Oriented_ Programming in Python. We first make a non-financial example, developing the intuition behind the need of a change of programming paradigm to be able to cohordinate together different pieces of code. Once we have established the intuition, we then leverage on some basic financial knowledge to develop a Black-Scholes pricer for European call Options, first, and then a more general pricer for Plain-Vanilla put Options as well. | [.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/blob/master/Notebook_Tutorials/Derivatives_Analytics___Introduction_to_OOP.ipynb) | [watch]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIS0g8TmV1NI7lr2I7BF9wdJ_PK9mVAz) |\n| **Derivatives Analytics - Inheritance and Polymorphism**: in this tutorial we introduce _Inheritance_ and _Polymorphism_ in Python which are two milestones in Object-Oriented programming. We present these concepts introducing Digital cash-or-nothing Options and observing their similarities with Plain-Vanilla Options. Inheritance and Polymorphism allow us to leverage on the financial analogies between these two contracts and eventually represent them more efficiently as derived classes of a unique `EuropeanOption` abstract base class. | [.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/blob/master/Notebook_Tutorials/Derivatives_Analytics___Inheritance_and_Polymorphism.ipynb) | [watch]() |\n| **Derivatives Analytics - Objects Composition**: in this tutorial we introduce _Composition_ which is an additional way to model relationships among objects, alternatively to Inheritance. We present this relationship introducing a common `MarketEnvironment` under which Option contracts are emitted, a `Portfolio` class is designed to aggregate Options and another `Plotter` class is designed to provide visualization routines. Finally, we examine several Option Strategies which uses the architecture implemented so far. | [.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/blob/master/Notebook_Tutorials/Derivatives_Analytics___Objects_Composition.ipynb) | [watch]() |\n| **Derivatives Analytics - Options Greeks**: in this tutorial we introduce Option Greeks. That is, the derivatives of an option price with respect to its pricing parameters. We provide both a numeric computation using _finite-difference_ methods implemented in `NumericGreeks` class and their analytic expression using the Black-Scholes model. Finally, all features introduced in this and previous tutorial are collected in the `pyBlackScholesAnalytics` Python package which is hereby introduced. | [.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/blob/master/Notebook_Tutorials/Derivatives_Analytics___Options_Greeks.ipynb) | [watch]() |\n\n## Examples <a name=\"Examples\"></a>\n\n| <!-- -->  | <!-- --> |\n|:-------------------:|:--------------------------|\n| [options.py](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/blob/master/examples/options.py) | This example shows basic usage of `PlainVanillaOption` and `DigitalOption` classes.
