**[copyparty-sfx.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty-sfx.py)** -- that's it! 🎉\n\n* or install through pypi (python3 only): `python3 -m pip install --user -U copyparty`\n* or if you cannot install python, you can use [copyparty.exe](#copypartyexe) instead\n* or if you are on android, [install copyparty in termux](#install-on-android)\n* or if you prefer to [use docker](./scripts/docker/) 🐋 you can do that too\n  * docker has all deps built-in, so skip this step:\n\nenable thumbnails (images/audio/video), media indexing, and audio transcoding by installing some recommended deps:\n\n* **Alpine:** `apk add py3-pillow ffmpeg`\n* **Debian:** `apt install python3-pil ffmpeg`\n* **Fedora:** `dnf install python3-pillow ffmpeg`\n* **FreeBSD:** `pkg install py39-sqlite3 py39-pillow ffmpeg`\n* **MacOS:** `port install py-Pillow ffmpeg`\n* **MacOS** (alternative): `brew install pillow ffmpeg`\n* **Windows:** `python -m pip install --user -U Pillow`\n  * install python and ffmpeg manually; do not use `winget` or `Microsoft Store` (it breaks $PATH)\n  * copyparty.exe comes with `Pillow` and only needs `ffmpeg`\n* see [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies) to enable even more features\n\nrunning copyparty without arguments (for example doubleclicking it on Windows) will give everyone read/write access to the current folder; you may want [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes)\n\nsome recommended options:\n* `-e2dsa` enables general [file indexing](#file-indexing)\n* `-e2ts` enables audio metadata indexing (needs either FFprobe or Mutagen)\n* `-v /mnt/music:/music:r:rw,foo -a foo:bar` shares `/mnt/music` as `/music`, `r`eadable by anyone, and read-write for user `foo`, password `bar`\n  * replace `:r:rw,foo` with `:r,foo` to only make the folder readable by `foo` and nobody else\n  * see [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes) (or `--help-accounts`) for the syntax and other permissions\n\n\n### on servers\n\nyou may also want these, especially on servers:\n\n* [contrib/systemd/copyparty.service](contrib/systemd/copyparty.service) to run copyparty as a systemd service (see guide inside)\n* [contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service](contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service) to run it in a chroot (for extra security)\n* [contrib/rc/copyparty](contrib/rc/copyparty) to run copyparty on FreeBSD\n* [contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf](contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf) to [reverse-proxy](#reverse-proxy) behind nginx (for better https)\n\nand remember to open the ports you want; here's a complete example including every feature copyparty has to offer:\n```\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80,443,3921,3923,3945,3990}/tcp  # --zone=libvirt\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=12000-12099/tcp --permanent  # --zone=libvirt\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={1900,5353}/udp  # --zone=libvirt\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n```\n(1900:ssdp, 3921:ftp, 3923:http/https, 3945:smb, 3990:ftps, 5353:mdns, 12000:passive-ftp)\n\n\n## features\n\n* backend stuff\n  * ☑ IPv6\n  * ☑ [multiprocessing](#performance) (actual multithreading)\n  * ☑ volumes (mountpoints)\n  * ☑

something missing? post any crazy ideas you've got as a [feature request](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/issues/new?assignees=9001&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md) or [discussion](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/discussions/new?category=ideas) 🤙\n\n\n## testimonials\n\nsmall collection of user feedback\n\n`good enough`, `surprisingly correct`, `certified good software`, `just works`, `why`, `wow this is better than nextcloud`\n\n\n# motivations\n\nproject goals / philosophy\n\n* inverse linux philosophy -- do all the things, and do an *okay* job\n  * quick drop-in service to get a lot of features in a pinch\n  * some of [the alternatives](./docs/versus.md) might be a better fit for you\n* run anywhere, support everything\n  * as many web-browsers and python versions as possible\n    * every browser should at least be able to browse, download, upload files\n    * be a good emergency solution for transferring stuff between ancient boxes\n  * minimal dependencies\n    * but optional dependencies adding bonus-features are ok\n    * everything being plaintext makes it possible to proofread for malicious code\n  * no preparations / setup necessary, just run the sfx (which is also plaintext)\n* adaptable, malleable, hackable\n  * no build steps; modify the js/python without needing node.js or anything like that\n\n\n## notes\n\ngeneral notes:\n* paper-printing is affected by dark/light-mode! use lightmode for color, darkmode for grayscale\n  * because no browsers currently implement the media-query to do this properly orz\n\nbrowser-specific:\n* iPhone/iPad: use Firefox to download files\n* Android-Chrome: increase \"parallel uploads\" for higher speed (android bug)\n* Android-Firefox: takes a while to select files (their fix for ☝️)\n* Desktop-Firefox: ~~may use gigabytes of RAM if your files are massive~~ *seems to be OK now*\n* Desktop-Firefox: [may stop you from unplugging USB flashdrives](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1792598) until you visit `about:memory` and click `Minimize memory usage`\n\nserver-os-specific:\n* RHEL8 / Rocky8: you can run copyparty using `/usr/libexec/platform-python`\n\nserver notes:\n* pypy is supported but regular cpython is faster if you enable the database\n\n\n# bugs\n\n* Windows: python 2.7 cannot index non-ascii filenames with `-e2d`\n* Windows: python 2.7 cannot handle filenames with mojibake\n* `--th-ff-jpg` may fix video thumbnails on some FFmpeg versions (macos, some linux)\n* `--th-ff-swr` may fix audio thumbnails on some FFmpeg versions\n\n## general bugs\n\n* Windows: if the `up2k.db` (filesystem index) is on a samba-share or network disk, you'll get unpredictable behavior if the share is disconnected for a bit\n  * use `--hist` or the `hist` volflag (`-v [...]:c,hist=/tmp/foo`) to place the db on a local disk instead\n* all volumes must exist / be available on startup; up2k (mtp especially) gets funky otherwise\n* probably more, pls let me know\n\n## not my bugs\n\n* [Chrome issue 1317069](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1317069) -- if you try to upload a folder which contains symlinks by dragging it into the browser, the symlinked files will not get uploaded\n\n* [Chrome issue 1352210](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1352210) -- plaintext http may be faster at filehashing than https (but also extremely CPU-intensive)\n\n* [Firefox issue 1790500](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1790500) -- entire browser can crash after uploading ~4000 small files\n\n* iPhones: the volume control doesn't work because [apple doesn't want it to](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW11)\n  * *future workaround:* enable the equalizer, make it all-zero, and set a negative boost to reduce the volume\n    * \"future\" because `AudioContext` can't maintain a stable playback speed in the current iOS version (15.7), maybe one day...\n\n* Windows: folders cannot be accessed if the name ends with `.`\n  * python or windows bug\n\n* Windows: msys2-python 3.8.6 occasionally throws `RuntimeError: release unlocked lock` when leaving a scoped mutex in up2k\n  * this is an msys2 bug, the regular windows edition of python is fine\n\n* VirtualBox: sqlite throws `Disk I/O Error` when running in a VM and the up2k database is in a vboxsf\n  * use `--hist` or the `hist` volflag (`-v [...]:c,hist=/tmp/foo`) to place the db inside the vm instead\n\n* Ubuntu: dragging files from certain folders into firefox or chrome is impossible\n  * due to snap security policies -- see `snap connections firefox` for the allowlist, `removable-media` permits all of `/mnt` and `/media` apparently\n\n\n# breaking changes\n\nupgrade notes\n\n* `1.6.0` (2023-01-29):\n  * http-api: delete/move is now `POST` instead of `GET`\n  * everything other than `GET` and `HEAD` must pass [cors validation](#cors)\n* `1.5.0` (2022-12-03): [new chunksize formula](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/commit/54e1c8d261df) for files larger than 128 GiB\n  * **users:** upgrade to the latest [cli uploader](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/up2k.py) if you use that\n  * **devs:** update third-party up2k clients (if those even exist)\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n\"frequently\" asked questions\n\n* is it possible to block read-access to folders unless you know the exact URL for a particular file inside?\n  * yes, using the [`g` permission](#accounts-and-volumes), see the examples there\n  * you can also do this with linux filesystem permissions; `chmod 111 music` will make it possible to access files and folders inside the `music` folder but not list the immediate contents -- also works with other software, not just copyparty\n\n* can I make copyparty download a file to my server if I give it a URL?\n  * yes, using [hooks](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/hooks/wget.py)\n\n\n# accounts and volumes\n\nper-folder, per-user permissions  - if your setup is getting complex, consider making a [config file](./docs/example.conf) instead of using arguments\n* much easier to manage, and you can modify the config at runtime with `systemctl reload copyparty` or more conveniently using the `[reload cfg]` button in the control-panel (if logged in as admin)\n  * changes to the `[global]` config section requires a restart to take effect\n\na quick summary can be seen using `--help-accounts`\n\nconfiguring accounts/volumes with arguments:\n* `-a usr:pwd` adds account `usr` with password `pwd`\n* `-v .::r` adds current-folder `.` as the webroot, `r`eadable by anyone\n  * the syntax is `-v src:dst:perm:perm:...` so local-path, url-path, and one or more permissions to set\n  * granting the same permissions to multiple accounts:  \n    `-v .::r,usr1,usr2:rw,usr3,usr4` = usr1/2 read-only, 3/4 read-write\n\npermissions:\n* `r` (read): browse folder contents, download files, download as zip/tar\n* `w` (write): upload files, move files *into* this folder\n* `m` (move): move files/folders *from* this folder\n* `d` (delete): delete files/folders\n* `g` (get): only download files, cannot see folder contents or zip/tar\n* `G` (upget): same as `g` except uploaders get to see their own filekeys (see `fk` in examples below)\n\nexamples:\n* add accounts named u1, u2, u3 with passwords p1, p2, p3: `-a u1:p1 -a u2:p2 -a u3:p3`\n* make folder `/srv` the root of the filesystem, read-only by anyone: `-v /srv::r`\n* make folder `/mnt/music` available at `/music`, read-only for u1 and u2, read-write for u3: `-v /mnt/music:music:r,u1,u2:rw,u3`\n  * unauthorized users accessing the webroot can see that the `music` folder exists, but cannot open it\n* make folder `/mnt/incoming` available at `/inc`, write-only for u1, read-move for u2: `-v /mnt/incoming:inc:w,u1:rm,u2`\n  * unauthorized users accessing the webroot can see that the `inc` folder exists, but cannot open it\n  * `u1` can open the `inc` folder, but cannot see the contents, only upload new files to it\n  * `u2` can browse it and move files *from* `/inc` into any folder where `u2` has write-access\n* make folder `/mnt/ss` available at `/i`, read-write for u1, get-only for everyone else, and enable filekeys: `-v /mnt/ss:i:rw,u1:g:c,fk=4`\n  * `c,fk=4` sets the `fk` (filekey) volflag to 4, meaning each file gets a 4-character accesskey\n  * `u1` can upload files, browse the folder, and see the generated filekeys\n  * other users cannot browse the folder, but can access the files if they have the full file URL with the filekey\n  * replacing the `g` permission with `wg` would let anonymous users upload files, but not see the required filekey to access it\n  * replacing the `g` permission with `wG` would let anonymous users upload files, receiving a working direct link in return\n\nanyone trying to bruteforce a password gets banned according to `--ban-pw`; default is 24h ban for 9 failed attempts in 1 hour\n\n\n## shadowing\n\nhiding specific subfolders  by mounting another volume on top of them\n\nfor example `-v /mnt::r -v /var/empty:web/certs:r` mounts the server folder `/mnt` as the webroot, but another volume is mounted at `/web/certs` -- so visitors can only see the contents of `/mnt` and `/mnt/web` (at URLs `/` and `/web`), but not `/mnt/web/certs` because URL `/web/certs` is mapped to `/var/empty`\n\n\n# the browser\n\naccessing a copyparty server using a web-browser\n\n![copyparty-browser-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/192042695-522b3ec7-6845-494a-abdb-d1c0d0e23801.png)\n\n\n## tabs\n\nthe main tabs in

web-browser to upload  (or use the [command-line uploader](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#up2kpy))\n\nthis initiates an upload using `up2k`; there are two uploaders available:\n* `[🎈] bup`, the basic uploader, supports almost every browser since netscape 4.0\n* `[🚀] up2k`, the good / fancy one\n\nNB: you can undo/delete your own uploads with `[🧯]` [unpost](#unpost)\n\nup2k has several advantages:\n* you can drop folders into the browser (files are added recursively)\n* files are processed in chunks, and each chunk is checksummed\n  * uploads autoresume if they are interrupted by network issues\n  * uploads resume if you reboot your browser or pc, just upload the same files again\n  * server detects any corruption; the client reuploads affected chunks\n  * the client doesn't upload anything that already exists on the server\n* much higher speeds than ftp/scp/tarpipe on some internet connections (mainly american ones) thanks to parallel connections\n* the last-modified timestamp of the file is preserved\n\n> it is perfectly safe to restart / upgrade copyparty while someone is uploading to it!  \n> all known up2k clients will resume just fine 💪\n\nsee [up2k](#up2k) for details on how it works, or watch a [demo video](https://a.ocv.me/pub/demo/pics-vids/#gf-0f6f5c0d)\n\n![copyparty-upload-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635371-48fc54ca-fa91-48e3-9b1d-ba413e4b68cb.png)\n\n**protip:** you can avoid scaring away users with [contrib/plugins/minimal-up2k.js](contrib/plugins/minimal-up2k.js) which makes it look [much simpler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/118311195-dd6ca380-b4ef-11eb-86f3-75a3ff2e1332.png)\n\n**protip:** if you enable `favicon` in the `[⚙️] settings` tab (by typing something into the textbox), the icon in the browser tab will indicate upload progress -- also, the `[🔔]` and/or `[🔊]` switches enable visible and/or audible notifications on upload completion\n\nthe up2k UI is the epitome of polished inutitive experiences:\n* \"parallel uploads\" specifies how many chunks to upload at the same time\n* `[🏃]` analysis of other files should continue while one is uploading\n* `[🥔]` shows a simpler UI for faster uploads from slow devices\n* `[💭]` ask for confirmation before files are added to the queue\n* `[🔎]` switch between upload and [file-search](#file-search) mode\n  * ignore `[🔎]` if you add files by dragging them into the browser\n\nand then theres the tabs below it,\n* `[ok]` is the files which completed successfully\n* `[ng]` is the ones that failed / got rejected (already exists, ...)\n* `[done]` shows a combined list of `[ok]` and `[ng]`, chronological order\n* `[busy]` files which are currently hashing, pending-upload, or uploading\n  * plus up to 3 entries each from `[done]` and `[que]` for context\n* `[que]` is all the files that are still queued\n\nnote that since up2k has to read each file twice, `[🎈] bup` can *theoretically* be up to 2x faster in some extreme cases (files bigger than your ram, combined with an internet connection faster than the read-speed of your HDD, or if you're uploading from a cuo2duo)\n\nif you are resuming a massive upload and want to skip hashing the files which already finished, you can enable `turbo` in the `[⚙️] config` tab, but please read the tooltip on that button\n\n\n### file-search\n\ndropping files into the browser also lets you see if they exist on the server\n\n![copyparty-fsearch-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635361-c79286f0-b8f1-440e-aaf4-6e929428fac9.png)\n\nwhen you drag/drop files into the browser, you will see two dropzones: `Upload` and `Search`\n\n> on a phone? toggle the `[🔎]` switch green before tapping the big yellow Search button to select your files\n\nthe files will be hashed on the client-side, and each hash is sent to the server, which checks if that file exists somewhere\n\nfiles go into `[ok]` if they exist (and you get a link to where it is), otherwise they land in `[ng]`\n* the main reason filesearch is combined with the uploader is cause the code was too spaghetti to separate it out somewhere else, this is no longer the case but now i've warmed up to the idea too much\n\n\n### unpost\n\nundo/delete accidental uploads\n\n![copyparty-unpost-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635368-3afa6634-c20f-418c-90dc-ec411f3b3897.png)\n\nyou can unpost even if you don't have regular move/delete access, however only for files uploaded within the past `--unpost` seconds (default 12 hours) and the server must be running with `-e2d`\n\n\n### self-destruct\n\nuploads can be given a lifetime,  afer which they expire / self-destruct\n\nthe feature must be enabled per-volume with the `lifetime` [upload rule](#upload-rules) which sets the upper limit for how long a file gets to stay on the server\n\nclients can specify a shorter expiration time using the [up2k ui](#uploading) -- the relevant options become visible upon navigating into a folder with `lifetimes` enabled -- or by using the `life` [upload modifier](#write)\n\nspecifying a custom expiration time client-side will affect the timespan in which unposts are permitted, so keep an eye on the estimates in the up2k ui\n\n\n## file manager\n\ncut/paste, rename, and delete files/folders (if you have permission)\n\nfile selection: click somewhere on the line (not the link itsef), then:\n* `space` to toggle\n* `up/down` to move\n* `shift-up/down` to move-and-select\n* `ctrl-shift-up/down` to also scroll\n\n* cut: select some files and `ctrl-x`\n* paste: `ctrl-v` in another folder\n* rename: `F2`\n\nyou can move files across browser tabs (cut in one tab, paste in another)\n\n\n## batch rename\n\nselect some files and press `F2` to bring up the rename UI\n\n![batch-rename-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/128434204-eb136680-3c07-4ec7-92e0-ae86af20c241.png)\n\nquick explanation of the buttons,  \n* `[✅ apply rename]` confirms and begins renaming\n* `[❌ cancel]` aborts and closes the rename window\n* `[↺ reset]` reverts any filename changes back to the original name\n* `[decode]` does a URL-decode on the filename, fixing stuff like `&amp;` and `%20`\n* `[advanced]` toggles advanced mode\n\nadvanced mode: rename files based on rules to decide the new names, based on the original name (regex), or based on the tags collected from the file (artist/title/...), or a mix of both\n\nin advanced mode,  \n* `[case]` toggles case-sensitive regex\n* `regex` is the regex pattern to apply to the original filename; any files which don't match will be skipped\n* `format` is the new filename, taking values from regex capturing groups and/or from file tags\n  * very loosely based on foobar2000 syntax\n* `presets` lets you save rename rules for later\n\navailable functions:\n* `$lpad(text, length, pad_char)`\n* `$rpad(text, length, pad_char)`\n\nso,\n\nsay you have a file named [`meganeko - Eclipse - 07 Sirius A.mp3`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtb0vDPruI) (absolutely fantastic album btw) and the tags are: `Album:Eclipse`, `Artist:meganeko`, `Title:Sirius A`, `tn:7`\n\nyou could use just regex to rename it:\n* `regex` = `(.*) - (.*) - ([0-9]{2}) (.*)`\n* `format` = `(3). (1) - (4)`\n* `output` = `07. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nor you could use just tags:\n* `format` = `$lpad((tn),2,0). (artist) - (title).(ext)`\n* `output` = `7. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nor a mix of both:\n* `regex` = ` - ([0-9]{2}) `\n* `format` = `(1). (artist) - (title).(ext)`\n* `output` = `07. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nthe metadata keys you can use in the format field are the ones in the file-browser table header (whatever is collected with `-mte` and `-mtp`)\n\n\n## markdown viewer\n\nand there are *two* editors\n\n![copyparty-md-read-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/115978057-66419080-a57d-11eb-8539-d2be843991aa.png)\n\n* the document preview has a max-width which is the same as an A4 paper when printed\n\n\n## other tricks\n\n* you can link a particular timestamp in an audio file by adding it to the URL, such as `&20` / `&20s` / `&1m20` / `&t=1:20` after the `.../#af-c8960dab`\n\n* enabling the audio equalizer can help make gapless albums fully gapless in some browsers (chrome), so consider leaving it on with all the values at zero\n\n* get a plaintext file listing by adding `?ls=t` to a URL, or a compact colored one with `?ls=v` (for unix terminals)\n\n* if you are using media hotkeys to switch songs and are getting tired of seeing the OSD popup which Windows doesn't let you disable, consider [./contrib/media-osd-bgone.ps1](contrib/#media-osd-bgoneps1)\n\n* click the bottom-left `π` to open a javascript prompt for debugging\n\n* files named `.prologue.html` / `.epilogue.html` will be rendered before/after directory listings unless `--no-logues`\n\n* files named `README.md` / `readme.md` will be rendered after directory listings unless `--no-readme` (but `.epilogue.html` takes precedence)\n\n\n## searching\n\nsearch by size, date, path/name, mp3-tags, ...\n\n![copyparty-search-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635365-c0ff2a9f-0ee5-4fc3-8bb6-006033cf67b8.png)\n\nwhen started with `-e2dsa` copyparty will scan/index all your files. This avoids duplicates on upload, and also makes the volumes searchable through the web-ui:\n* make search queries by `size`/`date`/`directory-path`/`filename`, or...\n* drag/drop a local file to see if the same contents exist somewhere on the server, see [file-search](#file-search)\n\npath/name queries are space-separated, AND'ed together, and words are negated with a `-` prefix, so for example:\n* path: `shibayan -bossa` finds all files where one of the folders contain `shibayan` but filters out any results where `bossa` exists somewhere in the path\n* name: `demetori styx` gives you [good stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGh0g14ZJ8I&list=PL3A147BD151EE5218&index=9)\n\nthe `raw` field allows for more complex stuff such as `( tags like *nhato* or tags like *taishi* ) and ( not tags like *nhato* or not tags like *taishi* )` which finds all songs by either nhato or taishi, excluding collabs (terrible example, why would you do that)\n\nfor the above example to work, add the commandline argument `-e2ts` to also scan/index tags from music files, which brings us over to:\n\n\n# server config\n\nusing arguments or config files, or a mix of both:\n* config files (`-c some.conf`) can set additional commandline arguments;

Please use `--smb-port` (see below) and [prisonparty](./bin/prisonparty.sh)\n  * account passwords work per-volume as expected, but account permissions are coalesced; all accounts have read-access to all volumes, and if a single account has write-access to some volume then all other accounts also do\n    * if no accounts have write-access to a specific volume, or if `--smbw` is not set, then writing to that volume from smb *should* be impossible\n    * will be fixed once [impacket v0.11.0](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/commit/d923c00f75d54b972bca573a211a82f09b55261a) is released\n  * [shadowing](#shadowing) probably works as expected but no guarantees\n\nand some minor issues,\n* clients only see the first ~400 files in big folders; [impacket#1433](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/issues/1433)\n* hot-reload of server config (`/?reload=cfg`) does not include the `[global]` section (commandline args)\n* listens on the first IPv4 `-i` interface only (default = :: = 0.0.0.0 = all)\n* login doesn't work on winxp, but anonymous access is ok -- remove all accounts from copyparty config for that to work\n  * win10 onwards does not allow connecting anonymously / without accounts\n* on windows, creating a new file through rightclick --> new --> textfile throws an error due to impacket limitations -- hit OK and F5 to get your file\n* python3 only\n* slow\n\nknown client bugs:\n* on win7 only, `--smb1` is much faster than smb2 (default) because it keeps rescanning folders on smb2\n  * however smb1 is buggy and is not enabled by default on win10 onwards\n* windows cannot access folders which contain filenames with invalid unicode or forbidden characters (`<>:\"/\\|?*`), or names ending with `.`\n\nthe smb protocol listens on TCP port 445, which is a privileged port on linux and macos, which would require running copyparty as root. However, this can be avoided by listening on another port using `--smb-port 3945` and then using NAT to forward the traffic from 445 to there;\n* on linux: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 445 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3945`\n\nauthenticate with one of the following:\n* username `$username`, password `$password`\n* username `$password`, password `k`\n\n\n## file indexing\n\nenables dedup and music search ++\n\nfile indexing relies on two database tables, the up2k filetree (`-e2d`) and the metadata tags (`-e2t`), stored in `.hist/up2k.db`. Configuration can be done through arguments, volflags, or a mix of both.\n\nthrough arguments:\n* `-e2d` enables file indexing on upload\n* `-e2ds` also scans writable folders for new files on startup\n* `-e2dsa` also scans all mounted volumes (including readonly ones)\n* `-e2t` enables metadata indexing on upload\n* `-e2ts` also scans for tags in all files that don't have tags yet\n* `-e2tsr` also deletes all existing tags, doing a full reindex\n* `-e2v` verfies file integrity at startup, comparing hashes from the db\n* `-e2vu` patches the database with the new hashes from the filesystem\n* `-e2vp` panics and kills copyparty instead\n* `--xlink` enables deduplication across volumes\n\nthe same arguments can be set as volflags, in addition to `d2d`, `d2ds`, `d2t`, `d2ts`, `d2v` for disabling:\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,e2dsa,e2tsr` does a full reindex of everything on startup\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2d` disables **all** indexing, even if any `-e2*` are on\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2t` disables all `-e2t*` (tags), does not affect `-e2d*`\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2ds` disables on-boot scans; only index new uploads\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2ts` same except only affecting tags\n\nnote:\n* the parser can finally handle `c,e2dsa,e2tsr` so you no longer have to `c,e2dsa:c,e2tsr`\n* `e2tsr` is probably always overkill, since `e2ds`/`e2dsa` would pick up any file modifications and `e2ts` would then reindex those, unless there is a new copyparty version with new parsers and the release note says otherwise\n* the rescan button in the admin panel has no effect unless the volume has `-e2ds` or higher\n* deduplication is possible on windows if you run copyparty as administrator (not saying you should!)\n\n### exclude-patterns\n\nto save some time,  you can provide a regex pattern for filepaths to only index by filename/path/size/last-modified (and not the hash of the file contents) by setting `--no-hash \\.iso$` or the volflag `:c,nohash=\\.iso$`, this has the following consequences:\n* initial indexing is way faster, especially when the volume is on a network disk\n* makes it impossible to [file-search](#file-search)\n* if someone uploads the same file contents, the upload will not be detected as a dupe, so it will not get symlinked or rejected\n\nsimilarly, you can fully ignore files/folders using `--no-idx [...]` and `:c,noidx=\\.iso$`\n\nif you set `--no-hash [...]` globally, you can enable hashing for specific volumes using flag `:c,nohash=`\n\n### filesystem guards\n\navoid traversing into other filesystems  using `--xdev` / volflag `:c,xdev`, skipping any symlinks or bind-mounts to another HDD for example\n\nand/or you can `--xvol` / `:c,xvol` to ignore all symlinks leaving the volume's top directory, but still allow bind-mounts pointing elsewhere\n\n**NB: only affects the indexer** -- users can still access anything inside a volume, unless shadowed by another volume\n\n### periodic rescan\n\nfilesystem monitoring;  if copyparty is not the only software doing stuff on your filesystem, you may want to enable periodic rescans to keep the index up to date\n\nargument `--re-maxage 60` will rescan all volumes every 60 sec, same as volflag `:c,scan=60` to specify it per-volume\n\nuploads are disabled while a rescan is happening, so rescans will be delayed by `--db-act` (default 10 sec) when there is write-activity going on (uploads, renames, ...)\n\n\n## upload rules\n\nset upload rules using volflags,  some examples:\n\n* `:c,sz=1k-3m` sets allowed filesize between 1 KiB and 3 MiB inclusive (suffixes: `b`, `k`, `m`, `g`)\n* `:c,df=4g` block uploads if there would be less than 4 GiB free disk space afterwards\n* `:c,nosub` disallow uploading into subdirectories; goes well with `rotn` and `rotf`:\n* `:c,rotn=1000,2` moves uploads into subfolders, up to 1000 files in each folder before making a new one, two levels deep (must be at least 1)\n* `:c,rotf=%Y/%m/%d/%H` enforces files to be uploaded into a structure of subfolders according to that date format\n  * if someone uploads to `/foo/bar` the path would be rewritten to `/foo/bar/2021/08/06/23` for example\n  * but the actual value is not verified, just the structure, so the uploader can choose any values which conform to the format string\n    * just to avoid additional complexity in up2k which is enough of a mess already\n* `:c,lifetime=300` delete uploaded files when they become 5 minutes old\n\nyou can also set transaction limits which apply per-IP and per-volume, but these assume `-j 1` (default) otherwise the limits will be off, for example `-j 4` would allow anywhere between 1x and 4x the limits you set depending on which processing node the client gets routed to\n\n* `:c,maxn=250,3600` allows 250 files over 1 hour from each IP (tracked per-volume)\n* `:c,maxb=1g,300` allows 1 GiB total over 5 minutes from each IP (tracked per-volume)\n\n\n## compress uploads\n\nfiles can be autocompressed on upload,  either on user-request (if config allows) or forced by server-config\n\n* volflag `gz` allows gz compression\n* volflag `xz` allows lzma compression\n* volflag `pk` **forces** compression on all files\n* url parameter `pk` requests compression with server-default algorithm\n* url parameter `gz` or `xz` requests compression with a specific algorithm\n* url parameter `xz` requests xz compression\n\nthings to note,\n* the `gz` and `xz` arguments take a single optional argument, the compression level (range 0 to 9)\n* the `pk` volflag takes the optional argument `ALGORITHM,LEVEL` which will then be forced for all uploads, for example `gz,9` or `xz,0`\n* default compression is gzip level 9\n* all upload methods except up2k are supported\n* the files will be indexed after compression, so dupe-detection and file-search will not work as expected\n\nsome examples,\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,pk=xz,0`  \n  folder named inc, shared at inc, write-only for everyone, forces xz compression at level 0\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,pk`  \n  same write-only inc, but forces gz compression (default) instead of xz\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,gz`  \n  allows (but does not force) gz compression if client uploads to `/inc?pk` or `/inc?gz` or `/inc?gz=4`\n\n\n## other flags\n\n* `:c,magic` enables filetype detection for nameless uploads, same as `--magic`\n  * needs https://pypi.org/project/python-magic/ `python3 -m pip install --user -U python-magic`\n  * on windows grab this instead `python3 -m pip install --user -U python-magic-bin`\n\n\n## database location\n\nin-volume (`.hist/up2k.db`, default) or somewhere else\n\ncopyparty creates a subfolder named `.hist` inside each volume where it stores the database, thumbnails, and some other stuff\n\nthis can instead be kept in a single place using the `--hist` argument, or the `hist=` volflag, or a mix of both:\n* `--hist ~/.cache/copyparty -v ~/music::r:c,hist=-` sets `~/.cache/copyparty` as the default place to put volume info, but `~/music` gets the regular `.hist` subfolder (`-` restores default behavior)\n\nnote:\n* markdown edits are always stored in a local `.hist` subdirectory\n* on windows the volflag path is cyglike, so `/c/temp` means `C:\\temp` but use regular paths for `--hist`\n  * you can use cygpaths for volumes too, `-v C:\\Users::r` and `-v /c/users::r` both work\n\n\n## metadata from audio files\n\nset `-e2t` to index tags on upload\n\n`-mte` decides which tags to index and display in the browser (and also the display order), this can be changed per-volume:\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,mte=title,artist` indexes and displays *title* followed by *artist*\n\nif you add/remove a tag from `mte` you will need to run with `-e2tsr` once to rebuild the database, otherwise only new files will be affected\n\nbut instead of using `-mte`, `-mth` is a better way to hide tags in the browser: these tags will not be displayed by default, but they still get indexed and become searchable, and users can choose to unhide them in the `[⚙️] config` pane\n\n`-mtm` can be used to add or redefine a metadata mapping, say you have media files with `foo` and `bar` tags and you want them to display as `qux` in the browser (preferring `foo` if both are present), then do `-mtm qux=foo,bar` and now you can `-mte artist,title,qux`\n\ntags that start with a `.` such as `.bpm` and `.dur`(ation) indicate numeric value\n\nsee the beautiful mess of a dictionary in [mtag.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/copyparty/mtag.py) for the default mappings (should cover mp3,opus,flac,m4a,wav,aif,)\n\n`--no-mutagen` disables Mutagen and uses FFprobe instead, which...\n* is about 20x slower than Mutagen\n* catches a few tags that Mutagen doesn't\n  * melodic key, video resolution, framerate, pixfmt\n* avoids pulling any GPL code into copyparty\n* more importantly runs FFprobe on incoming files which is bad if your FFmpeg has a cve\n\n`--mtag-to` sets the tag-scan timeout; very high default (60 sec) to cater for zfs and other randomly-freezing filesystems. Lower values like 10 are usually safe, allowing for faster processing of tricky files\n\n\n## file parser plugins\n\nprovide custom parsers to index additional tags,  also see [./bin/mtag/README.md](./bin/mtag/README.md)\n\ncopyparty can invoke external programs to collect additional metadata for files using `mtp` (either as argument or volflag), there is a default timeout of 60sec, and only files which contain audio get analyzed by default (see ay/an/ad below)\n\n* `-mtp .bpm=~/bin/audio-bpm.py` will execute `~/bin/audio-bpm.py` with the audio file as argument 1 to provide the `.bpm` tag, if that does not exist in the audio metadata\n* `-mtp key=f,t5,~/bin/audio-key.py` uses `~/bin/audio-key.py` to get the `key` tag, replacing any existing metadata tag (`f,`), aborting if it takes longer than 5sec (`t5,`)\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,mtp=.bpm=~/bin/audio-bpm.py:c,mtp=key=f,t5,~/bin/audio-key.py` both as a per-volume config wow this is getting ugly\n\n*but wait, there's more!* `-mtp` can be used for non-audio files as well using the `a` flag: `ay` only do audio files (default), `an` only do non-audio files, or `ad` do all files (d as in dontcare)\n\n* \"audio file\" also means videos btw, as long as there is an audio stream\n* `-mtp ext=an,~/bin/file-ext.py` runs `~/bin/file-ext.py` to get the `ext` tag only if file is not audio (`an`)\n* `-mtp arch,built,ver,orig=an,eexe,edll,~/bin/exe.py` runs `~/bin/exe.py` to get properties about windows-binaries only if file is not audio (`an`) and file extension is exe or dll\n* if you want to daisychain parsers, use the `p` flag to set processing order\n  * `-mtp foo=p1,~/a.py` runs before `-mtp foo=p2,~/b.py` and will forward all the tags detected so far as json to the stdin of b.py\n* option `c0` disables capturing of stdout/stderr, so copyparty will not receive any tags from the process at all -- instead the invoked program is free to print whatever to the console, just using copyparty as a launcher\n  * `c1` captures stdout only, `c2` only stderr, and `c3` (default) captures both\n* you can control how the parser is killed if it times out with option `kt` killing the entire process tree (default), `km` just the main process, or `kn` let it continue running until copyparty is terminated\n\nif something doesn't work, try `--mtag-v` for verbose error messages\n\n\n## event hooks\n\ntrigger a program on uploads, renames etc ([examples](./bin/hooks/))\n\nyou can set hooks before and/or after an event happens, and currently you can hook uploads, moves/renames, and deletes\n\nthere's a bunch of flags and stuff, see `--help-hooks`\n\n\n### upload events\n\nthe older, more powerful approach ([examples](./bin/mtag/)):\n\n```\n-v /mnt/inc:inc:w:c,mte=+x1:c,mtp=x1=ad,kn,/usr/bin/notify-send\n```\n\nso filesystem location `/mnt/inc` shared at `/inc`, write-only for everyone, appending `x1` to the list of tags to index (`mte`), and using `/usr/bin/notify-send` to \"provide\" tag `x1` for any filetype (`ad`) with kill-on-timeout disabled (`kn`)\n\nthat'll run the command `notify-send` with the path to the uploaded file as the first and only argument (so on linux it'll show a notification on-screen)\n\nnote that this is way more complicated than the new [event hooks](#event-hooks) but this approach has the following advantages:\n* non-blocking and multithreaded; doesn't hold other uploads back\n* you get access to tags from FFmpeg and other mtp parsers\n* only trigger on new unique files, not dupes\n\nnote that it will occupy the parsing threads, so fork anything expensive (or set `kn` to have copyparty fork it for you) -- otoh if you want to intentionally queue/singlethread you can combine it with `--mtag-mt 1`\n\n\n## hiding from google\n\ntell search engines you dont wanna be indexed,  either using the good old [robots.txt](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) or through copyparty settings:\n\n* `--no-robots` adds HTTP (`X-Robots-Tag`) and HTML (`<meta>`) headers with `noindex, nofollow` globally\n* volflag `[...]:c,norobots` does the same thing for that single volume\n* volflag `[...]:c,robots` ALLOWS search-engine crawling for that volume, even if `--no-robots` is set globally\n\nalso, `--force-js` disables the plain HTML folder listing, making things harder to parse for search engines\n\n\n## themes\n\nyou can change the default theme with `--theme 2`, and add your own themes by modifying `browser.css` or providing your own css to `--css-browser`, then telling copyparty they exist by increasing `--themes`\n\n<table><tr><td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165864907-17e2ac7d-319d-4f25-8718-2f376f614b51.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165867551-fceb35dd-38f0-42bb-bef3-25ba651ca69b.png\"></a>\n0. classic dark</td><td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/168644399-68938de5-da9b-445f-8d92-b51c74b5f345.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/168644404-8e1a2fdc-6e59-4c41-905e-ba5399ed686f.png\"></a>\n2. flat pm-monokai</td><td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165864901-db13a429-a5da-496d-8bc6-ce838547f69d.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165867560-aa834aef-58dc-4abe-baef-7e562b647945.png\"></a>\n4. vice</td></tr><tr><td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165864905-692682eb-6fb4-4d40-b6fe-27d2c7d3e2a7.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165867555-080b73b6-6d85-41bb-a7c6-ad277c608365.png\"></a>\n1. classic light</td><td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/168645276-fb02fd19-190a-407a-b8d3-d58fee277e02.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/168645280-f0662b3c-9764-4875-a2e2-d91cc8199b23.png\"></a>\n3. flat light\n</td><td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165864898-10ce7052-a117-4fcf-845b-b56c91687908.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/165867562-f3003d45-dd2a-4564-8aae-fed44c1ae064.png\"></a>\n5. <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/\">hotdog stand</a></td></tr></table>\n\nthe classname of the HTML tag is set according to the selected theme, which is used to set colors as css variables ++\n\n* each theme *generally* has a dark theme (even numbers) and a light theme (odd numbers), showing in pairs\n* the first theme (theme 0 and 1) is `html.a`, second theme (2 and 3) is `html.b`\n* if a light theme is selected, `html.y` is set, otherwise `html.z` is\n* so if the dark edition of the 2nd theme is selected, you use any of `html.b`, `html.z`, `html.bz` to specify rules\n\nsee the top of [./copyparty/web/browser.css](./copyparty/web/browser.css) where the color variables are set, and there's layout-specific stuff near the bottom\n\n\n## complete examples\n\n* read-only music server  \n  `python copyparty-sfx.py -v /mnt/nas/music:/music:r -e2dsa -e2ts --no-robots --force-js --theme 2`\n  \n  * ...with bpm and key scanning  \n    `-mtp .bpm=f,audio-bpm.py -mtp key=f,audio-key.py`\n  \n  * ...with a read-write folder for `kevin` whose password is `okgo`  \n    `-a kevin:okgo -v /mnt/nas/inc:/inc:rw,kevin`\n  \n  * ...with logging to disk  \n    `-lo log/cpp-%Y-%m%d-%H%M%S.txt.xz`\n\n\n## reverse-proxy\n\nrunning copyparty next to other websites  hosted on an existing webserver such as nginx, caddy, or apache\n\nyou can either:\n* give copyparty its own domain or subdomain (recommended)\n* or do location-based proxying, using `--rp-loc=/stuff` to tell copyparty where it is mounted -- has a slight performance cost and higher chance of bugs\n  * if copyparty says `incorrect --rp-loc or webserver config; expected vpath starting with [...]` it's likely because the webserver is stripping away the proxy location from the request URLs -- see the `ProxyPass` in the apache example below\n\nsome reverse proxies (such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)) can automatically obtain a valid https/tls certificate for you, and some support HTTP/2 and QUIC which could be a nice speed boost\n\nexample webserver configs:\n\n* [nginx config](contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf) -- entire domain/subdomain\n* [apache2 config](contrib/apache/copyparty.conf) -- location-based\n\n\n# browser support\n\nTLDR: yes\n\n![copyparty-ie4-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/118192791-fb31fe00-b446-11eb-9647-898ea8efc1f7.png)\n\n`ie` = internet-explorer, `ff` = firefox, `c` = chrome, `iOS` = iPhone/iPad, `Andr` = Android\n\n| feature         | ie6 | ie9  | ie10 | ie11 | ff 52 | c 49 | iOS | Andr |\n| --------------- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --- | ---- |\n| browse files    | yep | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| thumbnail view  |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| basic uploader  | yep | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| up2k            |  -  |  -   | `*1` | `*1` |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| make directory  | yep | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| send message    | yep | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| set sort order  |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| zip selection   |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| file rename     |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| file cut/paste  |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| navpane         |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| image viewer    |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| video player    |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| markdown editor |  -  |  -   | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| markdown viewer |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| play mp3/m4a    |  -  | yep  | yep  | yep  |  yep  | yep  | yep | yep  |\n| play ogg/opus   |  -  |  -   |  -   |  -   |  yep  | yep  | `*3` | yep |\n| **= feature =** | ie6 | ie9  | ie10 | ie11 | ff 52 | c 49 | iOS | Andr |\n\n* internet explorer 6 to 8 behave the same\n* firefox 52 and chrome 49 are the final winxp versions\n* `*1` yes, but extremely slow (ie10: `1 MiB/s`, ie11: `270 KiB/s`)\n* `*3` iOS 11 and newer, opus only, and requires FFmpeg on the server\n\nquick summary of more eccentric web-browsers trying to view a directory index:\n\n| browser | will it blend |\n| ------- | ------------- |\n| **links** (2.21/macports) | can browse, login, upload/mkdir/msg |\n| **lynx** (2.8.9/macports) | can browse, login, upload/mkdir/msg |\n| **w3m** (0.5.3/macports)  | can browse, login, upload at 100kB/s, mkdir/msg |\n| **netsurf** (3.10/arch)   | is basically ie6 with much better css (javascript has almost no effect) | \n| **opera** (11.60/winxp)   | OK: thumbnails, image-viewer, zip-selection, rename/cut/paste.

verifies checksums and does files in parallel, and deletes unexpected files on the server after upload has finished which makes file-renames really cheap (it'll rename serverside and skip uploading)\n\nalternatively there is [rclone](./docs/rclone.md) which allows for bidirectional sync and is *way* more flexible (stream files straight from sftp/s3/gcs to copyparty, ...), although there is no integrity check and it won't work with files over 100 MiB if copyparty is behind cloudflare\n\n* starting from rclone v1.63 (currently [in beta](https://beta.rclone.org/?filter=latest)), rclone will also be faster than up2k.py\n\n\n## mount as drive\n\na remote copyparty server as a local filesystem;  go to the control-panel and click `connect` to see a list of commands to do that\n\nalternatively, some alternatives roughly sorted by speed (unreproducible benchmark), best first:\n\n* [rclone-webdav](./docs/rclone.md) (25s), read/WRITE ([v1.63-beta](https://beta.rclone.org/?filter=latest))\n* [rclone-http](./docs/rclone.md) (26s), read-only\n* [partyfuse.py](./bin/#partyfusepy) (35s), read-only\n* [rclone-ftp](./docs/rclone.md) (47s), read/WRITE\n* davfs2 (103s), read/WRITE, *very fast* on small files\n* [win10-webdav](#webdav-server) (138s), read/WRITE\n* [win10-smb2](#smb-server) (387s), read/WRITE\n\nmost clients will fail to mount the root of a copyparty server unless there is a root volume (so you get the admin-panel instead of a browser when accessing it) -- in that case, mount a specific volume instead\n\n\n# android app\n\nupload to copyparty with one tap\n\n<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/packages/me.ocv.partyup/\"><img src=\"https://ocv.me/fdroid.png\" alt=\"Get it on F-Droid\" height=\"50\" /> '' <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/f-droid/v/me.ocv.partyup.svg\" alt=\"f-droid version info\" /></a> '' <a href=\"https://github.com/9001/party-up\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/release/9001/party-up.svg?logo=github\" alt=\"github version info\" /></a>\n\nthe app is **NOT** the full copyparty server! just a basic upload client, nothing fancy yet\n\nif you want to run the copyparty server on your android device, see [install on android](#install-on-android)\n\n\n# iOS shortcuts\n\nthere is no iPhone app, but  the following shortcuts are almost as good:\n\n* [upload to copyparty](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/41e98dd985cb4d3bb433222bc1e9e770) ([offline](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/raw/hovudstraum/contrib/ios/upload-to-copyparty.shortcut)) ([png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/226118053-78623554-b0ed-482e-98e4-6d57ada58ea4.png)) based on the [original](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ab415d5b4de3467b9ce6f151b439a5d7) by [Daedren](https://github.com/Daedren) (thx!)\n  * can strip exif, upload files, pics, vids, links, clipboard\n  * can download links and rehost the target file on copyparty (see first comment inside the shortcut)\n  * pics become lowres if you share from gallery to shortcut, so better to launch the shortcut and pick stuff from there\n\n\n# performance\n\ndefaults are usually fine - expect `8 GiB/s` download, `1 GiB/s` upload\n\nbelow are some tweaks roughly ordered by usefulness:\n\n* `-q` disables logging and can help a bunch, even when combined with `-lo` to redirect logs to file\n* `--http-only` or `--https-only` (unless you want to support both protocols) will reduce the delay before a new connection is established\n* `--hist` pointing to a fast location (ssd) will make directory listings and searches faster when `-e2d` or `-e2t` is set\n* `--no-hash .` when indexing a network-disk if you don't care about the actual filehashes and only want the names/tags searchable\n* `--no-htp --hash-mt=0 --mtag-mt=1 --th-mt=1` minimizes the number of threads; can help in some eccentric environments (like the vscode debugger)\n* `-j` enables multiprocessing (actual multithreading) and can make copyparty perform better in cpu-intensive workloads, for example:\n  * huge amount of short-lived connections\n  * simultaneous downloads and uploads saturating a 20gbps connection\n  \n  ...however it adds an overhead to internal communication so it might be a net loss, see if it works 4 u\n\n\n## client-side\n\nwhen uploading files,\n\n* chrome is recommended, at least compared to firefox:\n  * up to 90% faster when hashing, especially on SSDs\n  * up to 40% faster when uploading over extremely fast internets\n  * but [up2k.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/up2k.py) can be 40% faster than chrome again\n\n* if you're cpu-bottlenecked, or the browser is maxing a cpu core:\n  * up to 30% faster uploads if you hide the upload status list by switching away from the `[🚀]` up2k ui-tab (or closing it)\n    * optionally you can switch to the lightweight potato ui by clicking the `[🥔]`\n    * switching to another browser-tab also works, the favicon will update every 10 seconds in that case\n  * unlikely to be a problem, but can happen when uploding many small files, or your internet is too fast, or PC too slow\n\n\n# security\n\nsome notes on hardening\n\n* set `--rproxy 0` if your copyparty is directly facing the internet (not through a reverse-proxy)\n  * cors doesn't work right otherwise\n\nsafety profiles:\n\n* option `-s` is a shortcut to set the following options:\n  * `--no-thumb` disables thumbnails and audio transcoding to stop copyparty from running `FFmpeg`/`Pillow`/`VIPS` on uploaded files, which is a [good idea](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=3611) if anonymous upload is enabled\n  * `--no-mtag-ff` uses `mutagen` to grab music tags instead of `FFmpeg`, which is safer and faster but less accurate\n  * `--dotpart` hides uploads from directory listings while they're still incoming\n  * `--no-robots` and `--force-js` makes life harder for crawlers, see [hiding from google](#hiding-from-google)\n\n* option `-ss` is a shortcut for the above plus:\n  * `--unpost 0`, `--no-del`, `--no-mv` disables all move/delete support\n  * `--hardlink` creates hardlinks instead of symlinks when deduplicating uploads, which is less maintenance\n    * however note if you edit one file it will also affect the other copies\n  * `--vague-401` returns a \"404 not found\" instead of \"401 unauthorized\" which is a common enterprise meme\n  * `--ban-404=50,60,1440` ban client for 1440min (24h) if they hit 50 404's in 60min\n    * **NB:** will ban anyone who enables up2k turbo\n  * `--nih` removes the server hostname from directory listings\n\n* option `-sss` is a shortcut for the above plus:\n  * `--no-dav` disables webdav support\n  * `--no-logues` and `--no-readme` disables support for readme's and prologues / epilogues in directory listings, which otherwise lets people upload arbitrary (but sandboxed) `<script>` tags\n  * `-lo cpp-%Y-%m%d-%H%M%S.txt.xz` enables logging to disk\n  * `-ls **,*,ln,p,r` does a scan on startup for any dangerous symlinks\n\nother misc notes:\n\n* you can disable directory listings by giving permission `g` instead of `r`, only accepting direct URLs to files\n  * combine this with volflag `c,fk` to generate filekeys (per-file accesskeys); users which have full read-access will then see URLs with `?k=...` appended to the end, and `g` users must provide that URL including the correct key to avoid a 404\n    * the default filekey entropy is fairly small so give `--fk-salt` around 30 characters if you want filekeys longer than 16 chars\n  * permissions `wG` lets users upload files and receive their own filekeys, still without being able to see other uploads\n\n\n## gotchas\n\nbehavior that might be unexpected\n\n* users without read-access to a folder can still see the `.prologue.html` / `.epilogue.html` / `README.md` contents, for the purpose of showing a description on how to use the uploader for example\n* users can submit `<script>`s which autorun for other visitors in a few ways;\n  * uploading a `README.md` -- avoid with `--no-readme`\n  * renaming `some.html` to `.epilogue.html` -- avoid with either `--no-logues` or `--no-dot-ren`\n  * the directory-listing embed is sandboxed (so any malicious scripts can't do any damage) but the markdown editor is not\n\n\n## cors\n\ncross-site request config\n\nby default, except for `GET` and `HEAD` operations, all requests must either:\n* not contain an `Origin` header at all\n* or have an `Origin` matching the server domain\n* or the header `PW` with your password as value\n\ncors can be configured with `--acao` and `--acam`, or the protections entirely disabled with `--allow-csrf`\n\n\n## https\n\nboth HTTP and HTTPS are accepted  by default, but letting a [reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy) handle the https/tls/ssl would be better (probably more secure by default)\n\ncopyparty doesn't speak HTTP/2 or QUIC, so using a reverse proxy would solve that as well\n\n\n# recovering from crashes\n\n## client crashes\n\n### frefox wsod\n\nfirefox 87 can crash during uploads  -- the entire browser goes, including all other browser tabs, everything turns white\n\nhowever you can hit `F12` in the up2k tab and use the devtools to see how far you got in the uploads:\n\n* get a complete list of all uploads, organized by statuts (ok / no-good / busy / queued):  \n  `var tabs = { ok:[], ng:[], bz:[], q:[] }; for (var a of up2k.ui.tab) tabs[a.in].push(a); tabs`\n\n* list of filenames which failed:  \n  `​var ng = []; for (var a of up2k.ui.tab) if (a.in != 'ok') ng.push(a.hn.split('<a href=\\\"').slice(-1)[0].split('\\\">')[0]);

}; }\necho $?\n```\n\nafter the initial setup, you can launch copyparty at any time by running `copyparty` anywhere in Termux -- and if you run it with `--qr` you'll get a [neat qr-code](#qr-code) pointing to your external ip\n\nif you want thumbnails (photos+videos) and you're okay with spending another 132 MiB of storage, `pkg install ffmpeg && python3 -m pip install --user -U pillow`\n\n* or if you want to use `vips` for photo-thumbs instead, `pkg install libvips && python -m pip install --user -U wheel && python -m pip install --user -U pyvips && (cd /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/; ln -s libgobject-2.0.so{,.0}; ln -s libvips.so{,.42})`\n\n\n# reporting bugs\n\nideas for context to include in bug reports\n\nin general, commandline arguments (and config file if any)\n\nif something broke during an upload (replacing FILENAME with a part of the filename that broke):\n```\njournalctl -aS '48 hour ago' -u copyparty | grep -C10 FILENAME | tee bug.log\n```\n\nif there's a wall of base64 in the log (thread stacks) then please include that, especially if you run into something freezing up or getting stuck, for example `OperationalError('database is locked')` -- alternatively you can visit `/?stack` to see the stacks live, so http://127.0.0.1:3923/?stack for example\n\n\n# devnotes\n\nfor build instructions etc, see [./docs/devnotes.md](./docs/devnotes.md)\n",
