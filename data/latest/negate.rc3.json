Initializing the Negator\n\nFirst the Negator must be initialized:\n\n```Python\nfrom negate import Negator\n\n# Use default model (en_core_web_md):\nnegator = Negator()\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\nBy default, negate uses the spaCy model\n[`en_core_web_md`](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_md) for POS tagging\nand dependency parsing. However, in cases where accuracy is preferred over\nefficiency, negate also allows to use a Transformer model, namely the spaCy\nmodel [`en_core_web_trf`](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_trf). To use\nthis model, simply initialize the Negator passing `use_transformers=True`:\n\n```Python\n# Or use a Transformer model (en_core_web_trf):\nnegator = Negator(use_transformers=True)\n\n# Use a Transformer model with GPU (if available):\nnegator = Negator(use_transformers=True, use_gpu=True)\n```\n\nIf the models are not locally installed, negate will download them and install\nthem first. This only needs to occur once.\n\n<br>\n\n### 2. Negating sentences\n\nThen, to negate a sentence:\n\n```Python\nsentence = \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\"\n\nnegated_sentence = negator.negate_sentence(sentence)\n\nprint(negated_sentence)  # \"An apple a day, doesn't keep the doctor away.\"\n```\n\n<br>\n\nWhen the parameter `prefer_contractions` is set to `True` (default),\nmodifications to auxiliary verbs will use their contracted form<sup>2</sup>. For\nexample:\n\n```Python\nsentence = \"Speaking of doctors, I went to the doctor the other day.\"\n\nnegated_sentence = negator.negate_sentence(sentence, prefer_contractions=True)\nprint(negated_sentence)  # \"Speaking of doctors, I didn't go to the doctor the other day.\"\n\nnegated_sentence = negator.negate_sentence(sentence, prefer_contractions=False)\nprint(negated_sentence)  # \"Speaking of doctors, I did not go to the doctor the other day.\"\n```\n\n<sub><sup>2</sup> Note that this does not affect other existent verbs in the\nsentence that haven't been modified.</small></sub>\n\n<br>\n\n### Behavior upon unsupported sentences\n\nCurrently, negate will not be able to negate certain types of sentences (see\n[Current Limitations](#current-limitations) and [Irremediable\nCaveats](#irremediable-caveats)).\n\nIn some cases, negate will detect that a sentence is not supported. By default,\na warning will be issued:\n\n```console\nNegator - WARNING: Sentence not supported. Output might be arbitrary.\n```\n\n<br>\n\nIf you want the negator to fail instead of printing a warning, simply initialize\nit with `fail_on_unsupported` set to `True`, i.e.:\n\n```Python\nnegator = Negator(fail_on_unsupported=True)\n```\n\n<br>\n\nThis can be useful to skip unsupported sentences when running negate on a batch\nof sentences, e.g.:\n\n```Python\nnegator = Negator(fail_on_unsupported=True)\nsentences = [...]\nnegated_sentences = []\n\nfor sent in sentences:\n    try:\n        negated_sentences.append(negator.negate_sentence(sent))\n    except RuntimeError:\n        pass  # skip unsupported sentence\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Current Limitations\n\n**Negate should work fine for most cases.** However, it is currently in beta\nphase. Some features have not yet been implemented. Pull Requests are always\nwelcome!\n\n\n- [ ] **\"Some\", \"any\", \"yet\" are not properly supported.** E.g.: Negating the\n  sentence \"There are some features to be implemented.\" will currently output\n  \"There aren't some features to be implemented.\" Although this could still make\n  sense depending on the context (e.g., \"There aren't some features to be\n  implemented. No, not just *some*, there are a lot!\"), I assume most users\n  would expect \"some\" being replaced with \"any\" and vice versa. When it comes to\n  \"yet\", when negating a negation, it makes sense to remove it or replace it\n  with \"already\", e.g., \"I haven't been to Paris yet.\" ‚Üí \"I have been to Paris.\"\n\n- [ ] **[Inversions](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es-LA/grammar/british-grammar/inversion)\n  are not supported.** This mainly affects to questions, e.g., \"*Did* you go to\n  the concert?\" vs. \"You *did* go to the concert.\" Notice how in the first\n  example (interrogative) we have AUX + PRON + VERB and in the second\n  (affirmative) PRON + AUX + VERB.\n\n- [ ] **Non-verbal negations are not supported.** This type of negations, such\n  as \"A bottle with no cap.\" will produce the warning: `Negator - WARNING:\n  Sentence not supported. Output might be arbitrary`.\n\n- [ ] **The auxiliary \"ought\" is not supported.** \"Ought\" is the only auxiliary\n  followed by a \"to.\" This complicates things slightly. But yeah, it ought to be\n  implemented at some point.\n\n- [ ] **Certain verb conjunctions are not supported.** E.g.: \"She hates and\n  loves winter.\" ‚Üí \"She doesn't *hate* and *love* winter.\" Currently, only the\n  first verb will be correctly conjugated. In this cases, it would also make\n  sense to attend to boolean algebra (De Morgan's law) and replace the \"and\"\n  with \"or\"/ \"neither\"/\"nor\", i.e., \"She doesn't *hate* nor *love* winter.\"\n\n- [ ] **Multiple verb negation is not supported.** In many sentences with\n  subordinate clauses, it would make sense to negate several verbs. E.g.: \"I am\n  hungry because I didn't eat.\" ‚Üí \"I am *not* hungry because I *ate*.\"\n\n<br>\n\n## Irremediable Caveats\n\nLanguage took very seriously Bruce Lee's famous words \"be water, my friend.\" It\nis extremely flexible, and therefore, no number of rules, however large this\nnumber may be, will cover the whole realm of possibilities. Just when you think\nyour rules cover most of the cases, a new one comes in that breaks things. Early\nNLP researchers and developers know very well about this.\n\nNegate has no notion of meaning neither will ever do. Its scope its limited to\nsyntax. Because of this, in some cases, the produced negated sentences might\nsound rather off.\n\nNegate depends 100 % on POS tagging and dependency parsing. If any of them\nfails, negate will also fail. The spaCy models we use are not infallible, which\nadds another layer of \"things that could go wrong\" to negate.\n\nThis module was in fact developed to generate negation data in order to\nfine-tune NLP Deep Learning models (yes, Transformers ‚Äì can't believe I made it\nthis long without mentioning the word). They are, of course, the way to go for a\nfully-fledged negation that also attends to semantics.\n\n<br>\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nNegate has two core direct dependencies. Without them, negate wouldn't be able\nto exist:\n\n- [spaCy üí´](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy): As already mentioned, we rely\n  on POS tagging and dependency parsing to negate sentences. spaCy makes this\n  process very easy for us.\n\n- [LemmInflect üçã](https://github.com/bjascob/LemmInflect): Negations go far\n  beyond adding or removing a negation particle. In some cases, verbs have to be\n  properly conjugated (e.g., when negating verbs in third-person or in past\n  simple). LemmInflect provides us with this functionality.\n",
