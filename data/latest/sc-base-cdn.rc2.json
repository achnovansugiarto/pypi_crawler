    "description": "sc.base.cdn\n===========\n\n.. contents::\n\nOverview\n********\n\nThis package implements an easy way to configure a CDN to distribute skin \nelements of your site, thus reducing server accesses and improving response \ntime.\n\nsc.base.cdn as developed initially as a proof of concept and it's shipped with \nthree different providers:\n\n   * Coral CDN\n   * AlternateHostname\n   * MultipleHostnames\n\n\nRequirements\n************\n\n    **sc.base.cdn** has been tested with:\n    \n    * Plone 3.3.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)\n    \nInstallation\n************\n    \nTo use this package, on a buildout based installation:\n\n    1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.base.cdn``\n       to the list of eggs to install ::\n\n        [buildout]\n        ...\n        eggs = \n            sc.base.cdn\n\n    2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n\n        [instance]\n        ...\n        zcml = \n            ...\n            sc.base.cdn\n    \n\nIf another package depends on the sc.base.cdn egg or \nincludes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the \nbuildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.\n\nAfter updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',\nwhich will take care of updating your system.\n\nGo to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the\n'Add/Remove Products' link.\n\nChoose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.\n\nUninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only\nif you installed it from the quick installer.\n\nPost-Installation\n*****************\n\nThis package installs a control panel on your Plone instance. To access it \npoint your browser at http://<address_to_your_plone_site/@@cdn-controlpanel .\n\nThe CDN Control Panel allows you to enable/disable the CDN support and also \nchoose which CDN provider you plan to use. \n\nProviders\n*********\n\nThis package is bundled with three **very basic** CDN providers. Each one of \nthem could be used in production but it's possible to deploy new ones.\n\nCoralCDN\n--------\n\nCoralCDN is a decentralized, self-organizing, peer-to-peer web-content \ndistribution network. CoralCDN leverages the aggregate bandwidth of volunteers \nrunning the software to absorb and dissipate most of the traffic for web sites \nusing the system. In so doing, CoralCDN replicates content in proportion to the \ncontent's popularity, regardless of the publisher's resources.[#]_\n\nOur implementation basically appends the .nyud.net sufix to urls generated by \nresource registries (like portal_javascripts, portal_css, portal_kss).\n\nAlternateHostname\n-----------------\n\nThis provider allows you to designate an alternate hostname to serve skin \nresources for your portal. \nA very basic example would be to add 127.0.0.1 as an alternate hostname -- \nusing same port number as your zope instance -- during development, thus enabling \nresources to be downloaded from 127.0.0.1 while content will be served from \nlocalhost.\n\nMultipleHostnames\n-----------------\n\nActing in a similar way to AlternateHostname provider, MultipleHostnames allows \nyou to type in multiple values for hostname.\n\nWhen the absolute_url method from a resource registry is called, we use choice \nto pick one of the available hostnames and return it to the browser.\n\nUsing MultipleHostnames allows you to serve content from a hostname while \nresources will be called from up to 3 other addresses -- one for each registry.\n\n\nTodo/Future\n***********\n\n* Support other CDN providers as Amazon AWS/S3, FTP / SCP servers\n\n* Select which contents will be distributed by a CDN\n\nCredits\n*******\n\n    * Erico Andrei (erico at simplesconsultoria dot com dot br) - Coding and\n      Packaging\n\n..

[erico_andrei]\n\n* Support for AlternateHostname. [erico_andrei]\n\n* Support for CoralCDN. [erico_andrei]\n\n* Initial release [erico_andrei]",
