You may also need to setup paths to gdal headers.\n\nTo check which version of GDAL libraries you have installed on your computer, use gdal-config\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libgdal\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal\ngdal-config --version  # 3.0.1\npip install GDAL==3.0.1\n```\n\nNote: if you previously installed an older version of the lisflood-utilitiies, it is highly recommended to remove it before installing the newest version:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall lisflood-utilities\npip install -e./\n```\n\n\n## pcr2nc\n\n### Usage\n\n> __Note:__ This guide assumes you have installed the program with pip tool.\n> If you cloned the source code instead, just substitute the executable `pcr2nc` with `python pcr2nc_script.py` that is in the root folder of the cloned project.\n\nThe tool takes three command line input arguments:\n\n- -i, --input: It can be a path to a single file, a folder or a unix-like widlcard expression like _/path/to/files/dis00*_\n- -o, --output_file: Path to the output nc file\n- -m, --metadata: Path to a yaml or json file containing configuration for the NetCDF4 output file.\n\nUnless the input is a single file, the resulting NetCDF4 file will be a mapstack according to a time dimension.\n\nInput as a folder containing PCRaster maps. In this case, the folder must contain ONLY PCraster files and the output will be a mapstack.\n\n```bash\npcr2nc -i /path/to/input/ -o /path/to/output/out.nc -m ./nc_metadata.yaml\n```\n\nInput as a path to a single map. In this case, the output won't be a mapstack.\n\n```bash\npcr2nc -i /path/to/input/pcr.map -o /path/to/output/out.nc -m ./nc_metadata.yaml\n```\n\nInput as a _Unix style pathname pattern expansion_. The output will be a mapstack. __Note that in this case the input argument must be contained in double quotes!__\n\n```bash\npcr2nc -i \"/path/to/input/pcr00*\" -o /path/to/output/out.nc -m ./nc_metadata.json\n```\n\n#### Writing metadata configuration file\n\nFormat of resulting NetCDF4 file is configured into a metadata configuration file. This file can be written in YAML or JSON format.\n\nAn example of a metadata configuration file is the following\n\n```yaml\nvariable:\n  shortname: dis\n  description: Discharge\n  longname: discharge\n  units: m3/s\n  compression: 9\n  least_significant_digit: 2\nsource: JRC Space, Security, Migration\nreference: JRC Space, Security, Migration\ngeographical:\n  datum: WGS84\n  variable_x_name: lon\n  variable_y_name: lat\ntime:\n  calendar: proleptic_gregorian\n  units: days since 1996-01-01\n\n```\n\n#### Variable section\n\nIn `variable` section you can configure metadata for the main variable:\n\n- `shortname`: A short name for the variable\n- `longname`: The long name version\n- `description`: A description for humans\n- `units`: The units of the variable\n- `compression`: Optional, integer number between 1 and 9, default 0 (no compression). If present the output nc file will be compressed at this level.\n- `least_significant_digit`: Optional, integer number, default 2. From NetCDF4 documentation:\n\n> If your data only has a certain number of digits of precision\n(say for example, it is temperature data that was measured with a precision\nof 0.1 degrees), you can dramatically improve zlib compression by quantizing\n(or truncating) the data using the least_significant_digit keyword argument\nto createVariable. The least significant digit is the power of ten of the\nsmallest decimal place in the data that is a reliable value.\nFor example if the data has a precision of 0.1,\nthen setting least_significant_digit=1 will cause data the data to be\nquantized using `numpy.around(scale*data)/scale`, where `scale = 2**bits`,\nand bits is determined so that a precision of 0.1 is retained\n(in this case bits=4). Effectively, this makes the compression 'lossy'\ninstead of 'lossless', that is some precision in the data is sacrificed for the sake of disk space.\n\n#### Source and reference\n\n`source` and `reference` add information for the institution that is providing the NetCDF4 file.\n\n#### Geographical section\n\nIn the `geographical` section you can configure `datum` and name of the x and y variables. As `variable_x_name` and `variable_y_name` you should use 'lon' and 'lat' for geographical coordinates (e.g. WGS84) and 'x' and 'y' for projected coordinates (e.g. ETRS89).\n \nCurrently, pcr2nc supports the following list for `datum`:\n\n  * `WGS84`\n  * `ETRS89`\n  * `GISCO`\n\n#### Time section\n\nThis section is optional and is only required if the output file is a mapstack (a timeseries of georeferenced 2D arrays)\nIn this section you have to configure `units` and `calendar`.\n\n- `units`: Can be one of the following strings (replacing placeholders with the actual date):\n    - `hours since YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`\n    - `days since YYYY-MM-DD`\n- `calendar`: A recognized calendar identifier, like `proleptic_gregorian`, `gregorian` etc.\n\n## nc2pcr\n\nThis tool converts single maps netCDF (time dimension is not supported yet) to PCRaster format.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnc2pcr -i /path/to/input/file.nc -o /path/to/output/out.map [-c /path/to/clone.map optional]\n```\n\nIf input file is a LDD map, you must add the `-l` flag:\n\n```bash\nnc2pcr -i /path/to/input/ldd.nc -o /path/to/output/ldd.map  -l [-c /path/to/clone.map optional]\n```\n\n## Cutmaps: a NetCDF files cookie-cutter\n\nThis tool cut netcdf files, using a mask, a bounding box or a list of stations along with a LDD map.  \n\n### Usage:\nThe tool accepts as input:\n\n* a mask map (either PCRaster or netCDF format) or \n  - alternatively, matrix indices in the form xmini_xmaxi:ymini_ymaxi or\n  - alternatively, coordinates bounding box in the form xmin_xmax:ymin_ymax\n  - alternatively, list of stations with coordinates and a LDD map.\n* a path to a folder containing netCDF files to cut or a static dataset path like LISFLOOD static files. \n* a path to a folder where to write cut files.\n\nThe following command will cut all netcdf files inside _/workarea/Madeira/lai/_ folder \nand produced files will be writte in current folder. \nThe cookie-cutter that will be used is _/workarea/Madeira/maps/MaskMap/Bacia_madeira.nc_. \nThis file is a mask (boolean map with 1 only in the area of interest) where cutmaps takes the bounding box from.\nThe mask can also be in PCRaster format.\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -m /workarea/Madeira/maps/MaskMap/Bacia_madeira.nc -f /workarea/Madeira/lai/ -o ./\n```\n\n**Indices can also be passed as an argument (using -c argument instead of -m). Knowing your area of interest from your netCDF files, \nyou can determine indices of the array and you can pass in the form `imin imax jmin jmax`.**\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -c \"150 350 80 180\" -f /workarea/Madeira/lai/ -o ./\n```\n\n**Example with coordinates and path to EFAS/GloFAS static data (-S option), with -W to allow overwriting existing files in output directory:**\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -S /home/projects/lisflood-eu -c \"4078546.12 4463723.85 811206.57 1587655.50\" -o /Work/Tunisia/cutmaps -W\n```\n\n**Example with stations.txt and LDD**\n\nGiven a LDD map and a list of stations in a text file, each row having coordinates X/Y or lon/lat and an index, separated by tabs:\n\n```text\n4297500\t1572500 1\n4292500\t1557500 2\n4237500\t1537500 3\n4312500\t1482500 4\n4187500\t1492500 5\n```\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -S /home/projects/lisflood-eu -l ldd.map -N stations.txt -o /Work/Tunisia/cutmaps\n```\n\nIf ldd is in netCDF format, LDD will be converted to PCRaster format, first.\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -S /home/projects/lisflood-eu -l ldd.nc -N stations.txt -o /Work/Tunisia/cutmaps\n``` \n\nIf you experience problems, you can try to pass a path to a PCRaster clone map.\n\n```bash\ncutmaps -S /home/projects/lisflood-eu -l ldd.nc -C area.map -N stations.txt -o /Work/Tunisia/cutmaps\n```\nYou will find the produced mask.map and mask.nc for your area in the same folder of ldd map; you will need it for lisflood/lisvap executions.\nYou will also have outlets.map/outlets.nc based on stations.txt, which let you produce gauges TSS if configured in LISFLOOD.\n\n## compare utility\n\nThis tool let you compare two netcdf datasets. You can configure it with tolerances (atol, rtol, thresholds for percentage of tolerated different values).\nYou can also set the option to write diff files, so that you can inspect maps and differences with a tool like Panoply\n\n```text\nusage: compare [-h] -a DATASET_A -b DATASET_B -m MASKAREA [-M SUBMASKAREA]\n               [-e] [-s] [-D] [-r RTOL] [-t ATOL] [-p MAX_DIFF_PERCENTAGE]\n               [-l MAX_LARGEDIFF_PERCENTAGE]\n\nCompare netCDF outputs: 0.12.12\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -a DATASET_A, --dataset_a DATASET_A\n                        path to dataset version A\n  -b DATASET_B, --dataset_b DATASET_B\n                        path to dataset version B\n  -m MASKAREA, --maskarea MASKAREA\n                        path to mask\n  -e, --array-equal     flag to compare files to be identical\n  -s, --skip-missing    flag to skip missing files in comparison\n  -D, --save-diffs      flag to save diffs in netcdf files for visual\n                        comparisons. Files are saved in ./diffs folder of\n                        current directory.For each file presenting\n                        differences, you will find files diffs, original A and\n                        B (only for timesteps where differences are found).\n  -r RTOL, --rtol RTOL  rtol\n  -t ATOL, --atol ATOL  atol\n  -p MAX_DIFF_PERCENTAGE, --max-diff-percentage MAX_DIFF_PERCENTAGE\n                        threshold for diffs percentage\n  -l MAX_LARGEDIFF_PERCENTAGE, --max-largediff-percentage MAX_LARGEDIFF_PERCENTAGE\n                        threshold for large diffs percentage\n```\n\n## gfit\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe tool Gfit2 was created to extract flood warning thresholds from a map stack of daily discharge for several years, given in NetCDF format.\nIt is designed to work with any other variable as well as with different sampling (sub- or super- daily)\n\nThe tool is made of three files:\n\n1. Gfit2.sh: the main file, used to run the tool (e.g., ./Gfit2.sh ./settingFile_test.sh)\n2. settingFile_test.sh: a setting file, where paths and values of the input variables are defined. It can be renamed, as long as the correct name is called in the script (e.g.: set1.sh --> ./Gfit2.sh ./set1.sh)\n3. gfit2.r: the r script that  performs the extreme value analysis\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou need to have installed the following:\n\n- CDO\n- R\n\n### How to run\nThe tool operates in a Linux environment (also as a job with qsub). To run the tool you'll need:\n- R (the script was tested with R version 3.5.0)\n- the following R packages: ncdf4, lmomco, ismev\n- CDO (the script was tested with CDO version 1.6.5.1)\n\n### What does the tool do\n\nThe Gfit2 tool performs the following steps:\n- It takes the input file in NetCDF and extract the series of annual maxima. an optional number of warm-up years ($warmup_yrs) are excluded at the beginning of the data, to remove potential spin-up effect. Also the map of average value is computed\n- An extreme value fitting is performed on each pixel of the map, using L-moments and a 2-parameter Gumbel distribution. As option, the user can limit the analysis to a specific number of years. Also, one can use the option to remove from the fitting all values smaller than the long-term average. The fitting is performed only where at least 5 annual maxima are available, otherwise a NA is returned on the output map\n- Output return level maps (corresponding to user-selected years of recurrence interval) are saved in a netcdf file (return_levels.nc) and as ascii files. If a clone map in PCRaster format is provided, maps are also saved in PCRaster (return level maps and parameters of the Gumbel distribution)\n- After the EV fitting, the tool estimates some further statistics from the long-term input file, including minimum, maximum, and different percentile maps. This part can be commented out if not of interest\n\n### Reference\n[L-Moments: Analysis and Estimation of Distributions Using Linear Combinations of Order Statistics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345653)\n\nHosking, J.R.M., 1990.

The concept of water regions and information for their definition are explained [here](htpst://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use/). \nSince groundwater and surface water resources demand and abstraction are spatially distributed inside each water region, each model set-up must include all the pixels of the water region. This requirement is crucial for the succes of the calibration of the model. This utility allows the user to meet this requirement.\nMore specifically, this utility can be used to:\n1. create a water region map which is consistent with a set of calibration points: this purpose is achieved by using the script define_waterregions.\n2. verify the consistency between an existing water region map and an exixting map of calibration catchments: this purpose is achieved by using the script verify_waterregions\nIt is here reminded that when calibrating a catchment which is a subset of a larger computational domain, and the option wateruse is switched on, then the option groudwatersmooth must be switched off. The explanation of this requirement is provided in the chapter [Water use](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use/) of the LISFLOOD documentation. \n\n#### Requirements\npython3, pcraster 4.3. The protocol was tested on Linux.\n\n### define_waterregions\nThis utility allows to create a  water region map which is consistent with a set of calibration points. The protocol was created by Ad De Roo (Unit D2, Joint Research Centre).\n\n#### Input \n- List of the coordinates of the calibration points. This list must be provided in a .txt file with three columns: LONGITUDE(or x), LATITUDE(or y), point ID.\n- LDD map can be in netcdf format or pcraster format. When using pcraster format, the following condition must be satisfied: *PCRASTER_VALUESCALE=VS_LDD*. \n- Countries map in netcdf format or pcraster format. When using pcraster format, the following condition must be satisfied: *PCRASTER_VALUESCALE=VS_NOMINAL*. This map shows the political boundaries of the Countries, each Coutry is identified by using a unique ID. This map is used to ensure that the water regions are not split accross different Countries.\n- Map of the initial definition of the water regions in netcdf format or pcraster format. When using pcraster format, the following condition must be satisfied: *PCRASTER_VALUESCALE=VS_NOMINAL*. This map is used to attribute a water region to areas not included in the calibration catchments. In order to create this map, the user can follow the guidelines provided [here](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use/).\n- file *.yaml* or *.json* to define the metadata of the output water regions map in netcdf format. An example of the structure of these files is provided [here](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-utilities/tree/master/tests/data/waterregions)\n\n##### Input data provided by this utility:\nThis utility provides three maps of [Countries IDs](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-utilities/tree/master/tests/data): 1arcmin map of Europe (EFAS computational domain), 0.1 degree and 3arcmin maps of the Globe . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: both the rasters were retrieved by upsampling the original of the World Borders Datase provided by  http://thematicmapping.org/ (the dataset is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License).\n\n#### Output\nMap of the water regions which is consistent with the calibration catchments. In other words, each water region is entirely included in one calibration catchment.  The test to check the consistency between the newly created water regions map and the calibration catchments is implemented internally by the code and the outcome of the test is printed on the screen. \nIn the output map, each water region is identified by a unique ID. The format of the output map can be netcdf or pcraster.\n\n#### Usage\nThe following command lines allow to produce a water region map which is consistent with the calibration points (only one commad line is required: each one of the command lines below shows a different combination of input files format):\n\n*python define_waterregions.py -p calib_points_test.txt -l ldd_test.map -C countries_id_test.map -w waterregions_initial_test.map -o my_new_waterregions.map* <br>\n\n*python define_waterregions.py -p calib_points_test.txt -l ldd_test.nc -C countries_id_test.nc -w waterregions_initial_test.nc -o my_new_waterregions.nc -m metadata.test.json* <br>\n\n*python define_waterregions.py -p calib_points_test.txt -l ldd_test.map -C countries_id_test.nc -w waterregions_initial_test.map -o my_new_waterregions.nc -m metadata.test.yaml* <br>\n\n\nThe input maps can be in nectdf format or pcraster format (the same command line can accept a mix of pcraster and netcdf formats).It is imperative to write the file name in full, that is including the extension (which can be either \".nc\" or \".map\").<br>\nThe utility can return either a pcraster file or a netcdf file. The users select their preferred format by specifying the extension of the file in the output option (i.e. either \".nc\" or \".map\"). <br>\nThe metadata file in .yaml format must be provided only if the output file is in netcdf format.<br>\n\nThe code internally verifies that the each one of the newly created water regions is entirely included  within one calibration catchments. If this condition is satisfied, the follwing message in printed out: *“OK! Each water region is completely included inside one calibration catchment”*. If the condition is not satisfied, the error message is *“ERROR: The  water regions WR are included in more than one calibration catchment”*. Moreover, the code provides the list of the water regions WR and the calibration catchments that do not meet the requirment. This error highlight a problem in the input data: the user is recommended to check (and correct) the list of calibration points and the input maps.\n\nThe input and output arguments are listed below. \n\n\n```text\nusage: define_waterregions.py [-h] -p CALIB_POINTS -l LDD -C COUNTRIES_ID -w\n                              WATERREGIONS_INITIAL -o OUTPUT_WR\n\nDefine Water Regions consistent with calibration points: {}\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -p CALIB_POINTS, --calib_points CALIB_POINTS\n                        list of calibration points: lon or x, lat or y, point id.

This function must be used when the water region map and the map of calibration catchments have been defined in an independent manner (i.e. not using the utility **define_waterregions**). The function verify_waterregions verifies that each water region map is entirely included in one calibration catchment. If this condition is not satisfied, an error message is printed on the screen. \n\n#### Input\n- Map of calibration catchments in netcdf format.\n- Water regions map in netcdf format.\n\n#### Output\nThe output is a message on the screen. There are two options:\n- 'OK! Each water region is completely included inside one calibration catchment.'\n- 'ERROR: The  water regions WR are included in more than one calibration catchment’: this message is followed by the list of the water regions and of the catchment that raised the isuue.\nIn case of error message, the user can implement the function **define_waterregions**.\n\n#### Usage\nThe following command line allows to produce a water region map which is consistent with the calibration points:\n\n*python verify_waterregions.py -cc calib_catchments_test.nc -wr waterregions_test.nc*\n\nThe input and output arguments are listed below. All the inputs are required. \n\n```text\nusage: verify_waterregions.py [-h] -cc CALIB_CATCHMENTS -wr WATERREGIONS\n\nVerify that the Water Regions map is consistent with the map of the\ncalibration catchments\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -cc CALIB_CATCHMENTS, --calib_catchments CALIB_CATCHMENTS\n                        map of calibration catchments, netcdf format\n  -wr WATERREGIONS, --waterregions WATERREGIONS\n                        map of water regions, netcdf format\n```\n\nNOTE:\nThe utility **pcr2nc** can be used to convert a map in pcraster format into netcdf format.\n\n\n\n\n## Using lisfloodutilities programmatically \n\nYou can use lisflood utilities in your python programs. As an example, the script below creates the mask map for a set of stations (stations.txt). The mask map is a boolean map with 1 and 0. 1 is used for all (and only) the pixels hydrologically connected to one of the stations. The resulting mask map is in pcraster format.\n\n```python\nfrom lisfloodutilities.cutmaps.cutlib import mask_from_ldd\nfrom lisfloodutilities.nc2pcr import convert\nfrom lisfloodutilities.readers import PCRasterMap\n\nldd = 'tests/data/cutmaps/ldd_eu.nc'\nclonemap = 'tests/data/cutmaps/area_eu.map'\nstations = 'tests/data/cutmaps/stations.txt'\n\nldd_pcr = convert(ldd, clonemap, 'tests/data/cutmaps/ldd_eu_test.map', is_ldd=True)[0]\nmask, outlets_nc, maskmap_nc = mask_from_ldd(ldd_pcr, stations)\nmask_map = PCRasterMap(mask)\nprint(mask_map.data)\n```\n\n\n",
