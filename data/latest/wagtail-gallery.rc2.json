    "description": "Introduction\n===========================================\n\nThis is a very basic gallery app that integrates with Wagtail. It allows a person to upload images and order them on a gallery page. Said gallery page then shows the low-res thumbnails, and when clicked it opens up a high res version with captions.\n\nThis app is simple, and not feature rich. It does the basics and thats it. I will probably add more features and options to it as time permits, but only if requests are made.\n\nIt is also not production ready as there are **no tests currently written** for it. I did put this up on a site and they have been using it extensively and haven't had any reported issues. That said, *apps without tests should always be treated sceptically.*\n\nI hope to write tests in a month or so when I get a bit of free time. I also hope to add a bunch of features in the near future.\n\nPlease report any errors you encounter. I will try resolve them quickly and then add tests for them as things come up so it doesn't reoccur. Please visit `wagtail_gallery git <https://gitlab.com/dfmeyer/wagtail_gallery>`_ to make pull requests or log issues etc. Documentation is at readthedocs.io: `wagtail_gallery documentation <https://wagtail-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\nInstallation\n===================\n\nTo install run ``pip install wagtail_gallery``\n\nIt should automatically install all the necessary dependencies.\n\nRemember to add ``wagtail_gallery`` (along with the others mentioned) to your installed apps in settings.py i.e.\n\n    .. code-block:: Python\n\n        INSTALLED_APPS = [\n            ...\n            'wagtail_gallery',\n            'wagtail.contrib.routable_page',\n            'wagtail.contrib.modeladmin',\n            'django_social_share',\n        ]\n\nRequirements:\n\n    .. code-block:: Python\n\n        python3\n        wagtail\n        django\n        django-social-share\n\nI'm not quite sure how far back this app works; however, it should work going back quite far. It's currently tested on Python3 with Wagtail >2 and Django >2 on openSUSE. It should work on all platforms and shouldn't break anytime soon. Let me know if you have a combo that doesn't work and I'll see what I can do to support it.\n\nCaveats\n============\n\n#.  I haven't implemented sub-categories at all. Its a planned feature.\n\n#. You can only have one Gallery Root Page at this point in time. I really do want to add the ability to have many. I just haven't gotten round to it. It should be quite simple.\n\n#. URLs are not yet fully internationalised as ``/category/`` isn't translated. I'll get to this eventually.\n\n#. All galleries are public. No permissions have been integrated; however, this is a planned feature.",
