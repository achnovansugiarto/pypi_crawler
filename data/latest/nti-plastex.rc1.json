    "description": ".. image:: https://travis-ci.org/NextThought/nti.plasTeX.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/NextThought/nti.plasTeX\n\n.. note:: This README, while providing a basic introduction, is probably\n\t\t  outdated in many important ways in the context of this fork.\n\nInstallation of this package is done just like any other modern Python\npackage. See the INSTALL file for details.\n\nOnce you have plasTeX installed, you can use the command-line utility,\ncalled \"plastex\" just like latex or pdflatex.  For example, if you\nhave a LaTeX file called mybook.tex, simply run::\n\n    plastex mybook.tex\n\nThis will convert mybook.tex into XHTML (the default renderer).  Of course,\nthere are many options to control the execution of plastex.  Simply type\n\"plastex\" on the command line without options or arguments to see the\nfull list of command-line options.\n\nIt is also possible to write your own command-line utilities that leverage\nthe power of the plasTeX framework.  In fact, the essence of the \"plastex\"\ncommand can be written in just one line of code (not including the Python\nimport commands)::\n\n    import sys\n    from plasTeX.TeX import TeX\n    from plasTeX.Renderers.XHTML import Renderer\n    Renderer().render(TeX(file=sys.argv[1]).parse())\n\nplasTeX is really much more than just a LaTeX-to-other-format converter\nthough.  See the documentation at http://plastex.sf.net/ for a complete\nview of what it is capable of.",
