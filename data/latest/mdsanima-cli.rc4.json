The version must always be changed when a new version is\nreleased.\n\nThe next steps is a creating a tag and pushing the change to origin with tag,\ntype in terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit tag 0.1.2\ngit push origin && git push origin --tag\n```\n\nChecking the extracts version, type in terminal:\n\n```bash\npython -m setuptools_scm\n```\n\nFinally create the build and update this build to\n[test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/project/mdsanima-cli/) and\n[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/mdsanima-cli/) but first you must check and then update.\n\n```bash\npython -m build\ntwine check dist/*\ntwine upload -r testpypi dist/*\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n",
