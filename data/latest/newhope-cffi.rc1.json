    "description": "NewHope CFFI\n============\n\n`NewHope <https://newhopecrypto.org/data/NewHope_2019_07_10.pdf>`__ is a\nkey exchange protocol based on the Ring-Learning-with-Errors (Ring-LWE)\nproblem and a round 2 candidate submission in the `Post-Quantum\nCryptography\nStandardization <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization>`__\nproject organised by `NIST <https://www.nist.gov/>`__.\n\nThis package provides tested, performant **Python 3** CFFI bindings to\nthe `NewHope reference\nimplementation <https://github.com/newhopecrypto/newhope>`__ with minor,\ncautious adjustments for cross-platform compatibility.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install this package using ``pip`` or the included ``setup.py``\nscript:\n\n::\n\n   # Using pip\n   pip install newhope-cffi\n\n   # Using setup.py\n   python setup.py install\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   from newhope import generate_keypair, encrypt, decrypt\n   from secrets import compare_digest\n\n   # Alice generates a public key\n   public_key, secret_key = generate_keypair()\n\n   # Bob derives a secret (the plaintext) and encrypts it with Alice's public key to produce a ciphertext\n   ciphertext, plaintext_original = encrypt(public_key)\n\n   # Alice decrypts Bob's ciphertext to derive the now shared secret\n   plaintext_recovered = decrypt(secret_key, ciphertext)\n\n   # Compare the original and recovered secrets in constant time\n   assert compare_digest(plaintext_original, plaintext_recovered)\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n.. code:: text\n\n   BSD 3-Clause License\n\n   Copyright (c) 2018, Phil Demetriou\n   All rights reserved.\n\n   Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n   modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n   * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n     list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n   * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n     this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n     and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n   * Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\n     contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n     this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n   THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\n   AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\n   DISCLAIMED.
