Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.\n\n🤗 Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets then share them with the community on our [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). At the same time, each python module defining an architecture can be used as a standalone and modified to enable quick research experiments.\n\n🤗 Transformers is backed by the two most popular deep learning libraries, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), with a seamless integration between them, allowing you to train your models with one then load it for inference with the other.\n\n## Online demos\n\nYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). We also offer [private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API](https://huggingface.co/pricing) to use those models.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n- [Masked word completion with BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased?text=Paris+is+the+%5BMASK%5D+of+France)\n- [Name Entity Recognition with Electra](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/electra-large-discriminator-finetuned-conll03-english?text=My+name+is+Sarah+and+I+live+in+London+city)\n- [Text generation with GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2?text=A+long+time+ago%2C+)\n- [Natural Language Inference with RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli?text=The+dog+was+lost.+Nobody+lost+any+animal)\n- [Summarization with BART](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn?text=The+tower+is+324+metres+%281%2C063+ft%29+tall%2C+about+the+same+height+as+an+81-storey+building%2C+and+the+tallest+structure+in+Paris.+Its+base+is+square%2C+measuring+125+metres+%28410+ft%29+on+each+side.+During+its+construction%2C+the+Eiffel+Tower+surpassed+the+Washington+Monument+to+become+the+tallest+man-made+structure+in+the+world%2C+a+title+it+held+for+41+years+until+the+Chrysler+Building+in+New+York+City+was+finished+in+1930.+It+was+the+first+structure+to+reach+a+height+of+300+metres.+Due+to+the+addition+of+a+broadcasting+aerial+at+the+top+of+the+tower+in+1957%2C+it+is+now+taller+than+the+Chrysler+Building+by+5.2+metres+%2817+ft%29.+Excluding+transmitters%2C+the+Eiffel+Tower+is+the+second+tallest+free-standing+structure+in+France+after+the+Millau+Viaduct)\n- [Question answering with DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad?text=Which+name+is+also+used+to+describe+the+Amazon+rainforest+in+English%3F&context=The+Amazon+rainforest+%28Portuguese%3A+Floresta+Amaz%C3%B4nica+or+Amaz%C3%B4nia%3B+Spanish%3A+Selva+Amaz%C3%B3nica%2C+Amazon%C3%ADa+or+usually+Amazonia%3B+French%3A+For%C3%AAt+amazonienne%3B+Dutch%3A+Amazoneregenwoud%29%2C+also+known+in+English+as+Amazonia+or+the+Amazon+Jungle%2C+is+a+moist+broadleaf+forest+that+covers+most+of+the+Amazon+basin+of+South+America.+This+basin+encompasses+7%2C000%2C000+square+kilometres+%282%2C700%2C000+sq+mi%29%2C+of+which+5%2C500%2C000+square+kilometres+%282%2C100%2C000+sq+mi%29+are+covered+by+the+rainforest.+This+region+includes+territory+belonging+to+nine+nations.+The+majority+of+the+forest+is+contained+within+Brazil%2C+with+60%25+of+the+rainforest%2C+followed+by+Peru+with+13%25%2C+Colombia+with+10%25%2C+and+with+minor+amounts+in+Venezuela%2C+Ecuador%2C+Bolivia%2C+Guyana%2C+Suriname+and+French+Guiana.+States+or+departments+in+four+nations+contain+%22Amazonas%22+in+their+names.+The+Amazon+represents+over+half+of+the+planet%27s+remaining+rainforests%2C+and+comprises+the+largest+and+most+biodiverse+tract+of+tropical+rainforest+in+the+world%2C+with+an+estimated+390+billion+individual+trees+divided+into+16%2C000+species)\n- [Translation with T5](https://huggingface.co/t5-base?text=My+name+is+Wolfgang+and+I+live+in+Berlin)\n\n**[Write With Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co)**, built by the Hugging Face team, is the official demo of this repo’s text generation capabilities.\n\n## Quick tour\n\nTo immediately use a model on a given text, we provide the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n>>> classifier('We are very happy to include pipeline into the transformers repository.')\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9978193640708923}]\n```\n\nThe second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, the third line evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.8%.\n\nThis is another example of pipeline used for that can extract question answers from some context:\n\n``` python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for question-answering\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline('question-answering')\n>>> question_answerer({\n...     'question': 'What is the name of the repository ?',\n...     'context': 'Pipeline have been included in the huggingface/transformers repository'\n... })\n{'score': 0.5135612454720828, 'start': 35, 'end': 59, 'answer': 'huggingface/transformers'}\n\n```\n\nOn top of the answer, the pretrained model used here returned its confidence score, along with the start position and its end position in the tokenized sentence. You can learn more about the tasks supported by the `pipeline` API in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/task_summary.html).\n\nTo download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, you just need to use those three lines of codes (PyTorch version):\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\nor for TensorFlow:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\n\nThe tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on one (or list) of texts (as we can see on the fourth line of both code examples). It will output a dictionary you can directly pass to your model (which is done on the fifth line).\n\nThe model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) (depending on your backend) which you can use normally. For instance, [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) explains how to integrate such a model in classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune the on a new dataset.\n\n## Why should I use transformers?\n\n1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n    - High performance on NLU and NLG tasks.\n    - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\n    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\n    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n\n1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n    - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\n    - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\n    - Dozens of architectures with over 2,000 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages.\n\n1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:\n    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\n    - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch frameworks at will.\n    - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, production.\n\n1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n    - Examples for each architecture to reproduce the results by the official authors of said architecture.\n    - Expose the models internal as consistently as possible.\n    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n\n## Why shouldn't I use transformers?\n\n- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving in additional abstractions/files.\n- The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library.\n- While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples) are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\n\n## Installation\n\n### With pip\n\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.0.0+ (PyTorch 1.3.1+ for [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples)) and TensorFlow 2.0.\n\nYou should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n\nFirst, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.\n\nThen, you will need to install at least one of TensorFlow 2.0, PyTorch or Flax.\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#tensorflow-2.0-rc-is-available), [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) regarding the specific install command for your platform and/or [Flax installation page](https://github.com/google/flax#quick-install).\n\nWhen TensorFlow 2.0 and/or PyTorch has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\n```\n\nIf you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must [install the library from source](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html#installing-from-source).\n\n### With conda\n\nSince Transformers version v4.0.0, we now have a conda channel: `huggingface`.\n\n🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:\n\n```shell script\nconda install -c huggingface transformers\n```\n\nFollow the installation pages of TensorFlow, PyTorch or Flax to see how to install them with conda.\n\n## Models architectures\n\n**[All the model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models)** provided by 🤗 Transformers are seamlessly integrated from the huggingface.co [model hub](https://huggingface.co) where they are uploaded directly by [users](https://huggingface.co/users) and [organizations](https://huggingface.co/organizations).\n\nCurrent number of checkpoints: ![](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/models&color=brightgreen)\n\n🤗 Transformers currently provides the following architectures (see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_summary.html) for a high-level summary of each them):\n\n1. **[ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/albert.html)** (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper [ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942), by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.\n1. **[BART](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bart.html)** (from Facebook) released with the paper [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461.pdf) by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer.\n1. **[BARThez](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/barthez.html)** (from École polytechnique) released with the paper [BARThez: a Skilled Pretrained French Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12321) by Moussa Kamal Eddine, Antoine J.-P.

You can find them in the [`templates`](./templates) folder of the repository. Be sure to check the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and contact the maintainers or open an issue to collect feedbacks before starting your PR.\n\nTo check if each model has an implementation in PyTorch/TensorFlow/Flax or has an associated tokenizer backed by the 🤗 Tokenizers library, refer to [this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#bigtable)\n\nThese implementations have been tested on several datasets (see the example scripts) and should match the performances of the original implementations. You can find more details on the performances in the Examples section of the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html).\n\n\n## Learn more\n\n| Section | Description |\n|-|-|\n| [Documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) | Full API documentation and tutorials |\n| [Task summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/task_summary.html) | Tasks supported by 🤗 Transformers |\n| [Preprocessing tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/preprocessing.html) | Using the `Tokenizer` class to prepare data for the models |\n| [Training and fine-tuning](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) | Using the models provided by 🤗 Transformers in a PyTorch/TensorFlow training loop and the `Trainer` API |\n| [Quick tour: Fine-tuning/usage scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples) | Example scripts for fine-tuning models on a wide range of tasks |\n| [Model sharing and uploading](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_sharing.html) | Upload and share your fine-tuned models with the community |\n| [Migration](https://huggingface.co/transformers/migration.html) | Migrate to 🤗 Transformers from `pytorch-transformers` or `pytorch-pretrained-bert` |\n\n## Citation\n\nWe now have a [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-demos.6/) you can cite for the 🤗 Transformers library:\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{wolf-etal-2020-transformers,\n    title = \"Transformers: State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing\",\n    author = \"Thomas Wolf and Lysandre Debut and Victor Sanh and Julien Chaumond and Clement Delangue and Anthony Moi and Pierric Cistac and Tim Rault and Rémi Louf and Morgan Funtowicz and Joe Davison and Sam Shleifer and Patrick von Platen and Clara Ma and Yacine Jernite and Julien Plu and Canwen Xu and Teven Le Scao and Sylvain Gugger and Mariama Drame and Quentin Lhoest and Alexander M.
