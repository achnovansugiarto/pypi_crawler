    "description": "=================================\nti -- A silly simple time tracker\n=================================\n\n``ti`` is a small command line time-tracking application.\nSimple basic usage looks like this::\n\n    $ ti on my-project\n    $ ti fin\n\nYou can also give it human-readable times::\n\n    $ ti on my-project 30mins ago\n\n``ti`` sports many other cool features. Read along to discover.\n\nWat?\n====\n\n``ti`` is a simple command line time tracker. It has been completely rewritten\nin Python (originally a bash script) and has (almost) complete test coverage. It\nis inspired by `timed <http://adeel.github.com/timed>`_, which is a nice project\nthat you should check out if you don't like ``ti``. ``ti`` also takes\ninspiration from the simplicity of `t <http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/>`_.\n\nIf a time-tracking tool makes me think for more than 3-5 seconds, I lose my line\nof thought and forget what I was doing. This is why I created ``ti``. With\n``ti``, you'll be as fast as you can type, which you should be good with anyway.\n\nThe most important part about ``ti`` is that it provides just a few commands to\nmanage your time-tracking and then gets out of your way.\n\nAll data is saved in a JSON file ,``~/.ti-sheet``. (This can be changed using the\n``$SHEET_FILE``  environment variable.) The JSON is easy to access and can be\nprocessed into other more stylized documents. Some ideas:\n\n- Read your JSON file to generate beautiful HTML reports.\n- Build monthly statistics based on tags or tasks.\n- Read your currently working project and display it in your terminal prompt.\n  Maybe even with the number of hours you've been working.\n\nIt's *your* data.\n\nOh and by the way, the source is a fairly small Python script, so if you know\nPython, you may want to skim over it to get a better feel of how it works.\n\n*Note*: If you have used the previous bash version of ``ti``, which was horribly\ntied up to only work on Linux, you might notice the lack of plugins in this\nPython version. I am not really missing them, so I might not add them. If anyone\nhas any interesting use cases for it, I'm willing to consider.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nHere's the minimal usage style::\n\n    $ ti on my-project\n    Start working on my-project.\n\n    $ ti status\n    You have been working on my-project for less than a minute.\n\n    $ ti fin\n    So you stopped working on my-project.\n\n``on`` and ``fin`` can take a time (format described further down) at which to\napply the action::\n\n    $ ti on another-project 2 hours ago\n    Start working on another-project.\n\n    $ ti s\n    You have been working on another-project for about 2 hours.\n\n    $ ti fin 30 minutes ago\n    So you stopped working on another-project.\n\nAlso illustrating in the previous example is short aliases of all commands,\ntheir first letter. Like, ``s`` for ``status``, ``o`` for ``on``,\n``f`` for ``fin``, etc.\n\nPut brief notes on what you've been doing::\n\n    $ ti note waiting for Napoleon to take over the world\n    $ ti n another simple note for demo purposes\n\nTag your activities for fun and profit::\n\n    $ ti tag imp\n\nGet a log of all activities with the ``log`` (or ``l``) command::\n\n    $ ti log\n\nCommand reference\n=================\n\nRun ``ti -h`` (or ``--help`` or ``help`` or just ``h``)\nto get a short command summary of commands.\n\n``on``\n------\n\n- Short: ``o``\n- Syntax: ``ti (o|on) <name> [<time>...]``\n\nStart tracking time for the project/activity given by `<name>`. For example::\n\n    ti on conquest\n\ntells ``ti`` to start tracking for the activity ``conquest`` *now*.\nYou can optionally specify a relative time in the past like so::\n\n    ti on conquest 10mins ago\n\nThe format of the time is detailed further below.\n\n``fin``\n-------\n\n- Short: ``f``\n- Syntax: ``ti (f|fin) [<time>...]``\n\nEnd tracking for the current activity *now*. Just like with ``on`` command\nabove, you can give an optional time to the past. Example::\n\n    ti fin 10mins ago\n\ntells ``ti`` that you finished working on the current activity at, well, 10\nminutes ago.\n\n``status``\n----------\n\n- Short: ``s``\n- Syntax: ``ti (s|status)``\n\nGives short human-readable message on the current status, i.e., whether anything\nis being tracked currently or not. Example::\n\n    $ ti on conqering-the-world\n    Start working on conqering-the-world.\n    $ ti status\n    You have been working on `conqering-the-world` for less than a minute.\n\n``tag``\n-------\n\n- Short: ``t``\n- Syntax: ``ti (t|tag) <tag>...``\n\nThis command adds the given tags to the current activity. Tags are not currently\nused within the ``ti`` time tracker, but they will be saved in the JSON data\nfile. You may use them for whatever purposes you like.\n\nFor example, if you have a script to generate a HTML report from your ``ti``\ndata, you could tag some activities with a tag like ``red`` or ``important`` so\nthat activity will appear in red in the final HTML report.\n\nUse it like::\n\n    ti tag red for-joe\n\nadds the tags ``red`` and ``for-joe`` to the current activitiy. You can specify\nany number of tags.\n\nTags are currently for your purpose. Use them as you see fit.\n\n``note``\n--------\n\n- Short: ``n``\n- Syntax: ``ti (n|note) <note-text>...``\n\nThis command adds a note on the current activity. Again, like tags, this has no\nsignificance with the time tracking aspect of ``ti``. This is for your own\nrecording purposes and for the scripts your write to process your ``ti`` data.\n\nUse it like::\n\n    ti note Discuss this with the other team.\n\nadds the note ``Discuss this with the other team.`` to the current activity.\n\n``log``\n-------\n\n- Short: ``l1``\n- Syntax: ``ti (l|log) [today]``\n\nGives a table like representation of all activities and total time spent on each\nof them.\n\nTime format\n===========\n\nCurrently only the following are recognized. If there is something that is not\nhandled, but should be, please open an issue about it or a pull request\n(function in question is ``parse_time``)\n\n- *n* seconds ago can be written as:\n    - *n* seconds ago\n    - *n* second ago\n    - *n* secs ago\n    - *n* sec ago\n    - *n* s ago\n    - ``a`` in place of *n* in all above cases, to mean 1 second.\n    - E.g., ``10s ago``, ``a sec ago`` ``25 seconds ago``, ``25seconds ago``.\n\n- *n* minutes ago can be written as:\n    - *n* minutes ago\n    - *n* minute ago\n    - *n* mins ago\n    - *n* min ago\n    - ``a`` in place of *n* in all above cases, to mean 1 minute.\n    - E.g., ``5mins ago``, ``a minute ago``, ``10 minutes ago``.\n\n- *n* hours ago can be written as:\n    - *n* hours ago\n    - *n* hour ago\n    - *n* hrs ago\n    - *n* hr ago\n    - ``a`` or ``an`` in place of *n* in all above cases, to mean 1 hour.\n    - E.g., ``an hour ago``, ``an hr ago``, ``2hrs ago``.\n\nWhere *n* is an arbitrary number and any number of spaces between *n* and the\ntime unit are allowed (including zero spaces).\n\nStatus\n======\n\nThe project is in beta. If you find any bug or have any feedback, please do open\n`a GitHub issue <https://github.com/tbekolay/ti/issues>`_.\n\n\nGimme!\n======\n\nYou can download ``ti`` `from the source on\nGitHub <https://raw.github.com/tbekolay/ti/master/bin/ti>`_.\n\n- Put it somewhere in your ``$PATH`` and make sure it has executable permissions.\n- Install ``pyyaml`` using the command ``pip install --user pyyaml``.\n- Install ``colorama`` using the command ``pip install --user colorama``.\n\nAfter that, ``ti`` should be working fine.\n\nAlso, visit the `project page on GitHub <https://github.com/tbekolay/ti>`_ for\nany further details.\n\nWho?\n====\n\nOriginally created and fed by Shrikant Sharat\n(`@sharat87 <https://twitter.com/#!sharat87>`_).\nNow forked and maintained by Trevor Bekolay\n(`@tbekolay <https://github.com/tbekolay>`_) and friends on GitHub.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n`MIT License <http://mitl.sharats.me>`_.\n\n===============\nRelease History\n===============\n\n..
