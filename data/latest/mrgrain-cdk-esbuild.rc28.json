May contain errors.\nbundled_code = TypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\")\n\nfn = lambda_.Function(stack, \"MyFunction\",\n    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,\n    handler=\"index.handler\",\n    code=bundled_code\n)\n```\n\n### AWS S3: Static Website\n\n> 💡 See [React App (TypeScript)](examples/typescript/website) for a complete working example of a how to deploy a React app to S3.\n\nUse `TypeScriptSource` as one of the `sources` of a [static website deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html#roadmap):\n\n```python\nwebsite_bundle = TypeScriptSource(\"src/index.tsx\")\n\nwebsite_bucket = s3.Bucket(stack, \"WebsiteBucket\",\n    auto_delete_objects=True,\n    public_read_access=True,\n    removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,\n    website_index_document=\"index.html\"\n)\n\ns3deploy.BucketDeployment(stack, \"DeployWebsite\",\n    destination_bucket=website_bucket,\n    sources=[website_bundle]\n)\n```\n\n### Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics: Canary monitoring\n\n> 💡 See [Monitored Website (TypeScript)](examples/typescript/website) for a complete working example of a deployed and monitored website.\n\nSynthetics runs a canary to produce traffic to an application for monitoring purposes. Use `TypeScriptCode` as the `code` of a Canary test:\n\n> ℹ️ This feature depends on `@aws-cdk/aws-synthetics-alpha` which is in developer preview.\n> Please install the package using the respective tool of your language.\n> You may need to update your source code when upgrading to a newer version of this alpha package.\n\n```python\nbundled_code = TypeScriptCode(\"src/canary.ts\",\n    build_options=BuildOptions(\n        outdir=\"nodejs/node_modules\"\n    )\n)\n\ncanary = synthetics.Canary(stack, \"MyCanary\",\n    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_2,\n    test=synthetics.Test.custom(\n        code=bundled_code,\n        handler=\"index.handler\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe package exports various different constructs for use with AWS CDK features. The guiding design principal for this package is *\"extend, don't replace\"*. Expect constructs that you can provide as props, not complete replacements.\n\nFor use in **Lambda Functions** and **Synthetic Canaries**, the following classes implement `lambda.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.Code.html)) and `synthetics.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-synthetics-alpha.Code.html)):\n\n* `TypeScriptCode` & `JavaScriptCode`\n\nInline code is only supported by **Lambda**:\n\n* `InlineTypeScriptCode` & `InlineJavaScriptCode`\n\nFor use with **S3 bucket deployments**, classes implementing `s3deploy.ISource` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html)):\n\n* `TypeScriptSource` & `JavaScriptSource`\n\n> *Code and Source constructs seamlessly plug-in to other high-level CDK constructs. They share the same set of parameters, props and build options.*\n\nThe following classes power the other features. You normally won't have to use them, but they are there if you need them:\n\n* `TypeScriptAsset` & `JavaScriptAsset` implements `s3.Asset` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3_assets.Asset.html)) \\\n  creates an asset uploaded to S3 which can be referenced by other constructs\n* `EsbuildBundler` implements `core.BundlingOptions` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.BundlingOptions.html)) \\\n  provides an interface for a *esbuild* bundler wherever needed\n* `EsbuildProvider` implements `IBuildProvider` and `ITransformProvider` \\\n  provides the default *esbuild* API implementation and can be replaced with a custom implementation\n\n### [API Reference](API.md)\n\nAuto-generated reference for Constructs, Classes and Structs.\nThis information is also available as part of your IDE's code completion.\n\n### Python, .NET, Go\n\n*Esbuild* requires a platform and architecture specific binary and currently has to be installed with a Node.js package manager like npm.\n\nWhen using `cdk-esbuild` with Python, .NET or Go, the package will automatically detect local and global installations of the *esbuild* npm package.\nIf none can be found, it will fall back to dynamically installing a copy into a temporary location.\nThe exact algorithm of this mechanism must be treated as an implementation detail and should not be relied on.\nIt can however be configured to a certain extent.\nSee the examples below for more details.\n\nThis \"best effort\" approach makes it easy to get started.\nBut is not always desirable, for example in environments with limited network access or when guaranteed repeatability of builds is a concern.\nYou have several options to opt-out of this behavior.\n\n#### Provide a controlled installation of *esbuild*\n\nThe first step is to install a version of *esbuild* that is controlled by you.\n\nI **strongly recommend** to install *esbuild* as a local package.\nThe easiest approach is to manage an additional Node.js project at the root of your AWS CDK project.\n*esbuild* can then be added to the `package.json` file and it is your responsibility to ensure required setup steps are taken in all environments like development machines and CI/CD systems.\n\nInstead of installing the *esbuild* package in a local project, it can also be **installed globally** with `npm install -g esbuild` or a similar command.\nThis approach might be preferred if a build container is prepared ahead of time, thus avoiding repeated package installation.\n\n#### Change the automatic package detection\n\nThe second step is to make `cdk-esbuild` aware of your chosen install location.\nThis step is optional, but it's a good idea to have the location or at least the method explicitly defined.\n\nTo do this, you can set the `esbuildModulePath` prop on a `EsbuildProvider`.\nEither pass a known, absolute or relative path as value, or use the `EsbuildSource` helper to set the detection method.\nPlease refer to the [`EsbuildSource`](API.md#esbuildsource) reference for a complete list of available methods.\n\n```python\n# Use the standard Node.js algorithm to detect a locally installed package\nEsbuildProvider(\n    esbuild_module_path=EsbuildSource.node_js()\n)\n\n# Provide an explicit path\nEsbuildProvider(\n    esbuild_module_path=\"/home/user/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js\"\n)\n```\n\nAs a no-code approach, the `CDK_ESBUILD_MODULE_PATH` environment variable can be set in the same way.\nAn advantage of this is that the path can easily be changed for different systems.\nSetting the env variable can be used with any installation approach, but is typically paired with a global installation of the *esbuild* package.\nNote that `esbuildModulePath` takes precedence.\n\n#### Override the default detection method\n\nFor an AWS CDK app with many instances of `TypeScriptCode` etc. it would be annoying to change the above for every single one of them.\nLuckily, the default can be changed for all usages per app:\n\n```python\ncustom_module = EsbuildProvider(\n    esbuild_module_path=EsbuildSource.global_paths()\n)\nEsbuildProvider.override_default_provider(custom_module)\n```\n\n### Customizing the Esbuild API\n\nThis package uses the *esbuild* JavaScript API.\nIn most situations the default API configuration will be suitable.\nBut sometimes it is required to configure *esbuild* differently or even provide a custom implementation.\nCommon reasons for this are:\n\n* Using a pre-installed version of *esbuild* with Python, .NET or Go\n* If features not supported by the synchronous API are required, e.g. support for plugins\n* If the default version constraints for *esbuild* are not suitable\n* To use a version of esbuild that is installed by any other means than `npm`, including Docker\n\nFor these scenarios, this package offers customization options and an interface to provide a custom implementation:\n\n```python\n# my_custom_build_provider: IBuildProvider\n\n# my_custom_transform_provider: ITransformProvider\n\n\nTypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\",\n    build_provider=my_custom_build_provider\n)\n\nInlineTypeScriptCode(\"let x: number = 1\",\n    transform_provider=my_custom_transform_provider\n)\n```\n\n#### Esbuild binary path\n\nIt is possible to override the binary used by *esbuild* by setting a property on `EsbuildProvider`.\nThis is the same as setting the `ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH` environment variable.\nDefining the `esbuildBinaryPath` prop takes precedence.\n\n```python\nbuild_provider = EsbuildProvider(\n    esbuild_binary_path=\"path/to/esbuild/binary\"\n)\n\n# This will use a different esbuild binary\nTypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\", build_provider=build_provider)\n```\n\n#### Esbuild module path\n\nThe Node.js module discovery algorithm will normally be used to find the *esbuild* package.\nIt can be useful to use specify a different module path, for example if a globally installed package should be used instead of a local version.\n\n```python\nbuild_provider = EsbuildProvider(\n    esbuild_module_path=\"/home/user/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js\"\n)\n\n# This will use a different esbuild module\nTypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\", build_provider=build_provider)\n```\n\nAlternatively supported by setting the `CDK_ESBUILD_MODULE_PATH` environment variable, which will apply to all uses.\nDefining the `esbuildModulePath` prop takes precedence.\n\nIf you are a Python, .NET or Go user, refer to the language specific guide for a more detailed explanation of this feature.\n\n#### Custom Build and Transform API implementations\n\n> 💡 See [esbuild plugins w/ TypeScript](examples/typescript/esbuild-with-plugins) for a complete working example of a custom Build API implementation.\n\nA custom implementation can be provided by implementing `IBuildProvider` or `ITransformProvider`:\n\n```python\n@jsii.implements(IBuildProvider)\n@jsii.implements(ITransformProvider)\nclass CustomEsbuild:\n    def build_sync(self, *, bundle=None, splitting=None, preserveSymlinks=None, outfile=None, metafile=None, outdir=None, outbase=None, external=None, packages=None, alias=None, loader=None, resolveExtensions=None, mainFields=None, conditions=None, write=None, allowOverwrite=None, tsconfig=None, outExtension=None, publicPath=None, entryNames=None, chunkNames=None, assetNames=None, inject=None, banner=None, footer=None, absWorkingDir=None, nodePaths=None, sourcemap=None, legalComments=None, sourceRoot=None, sourcesContent=None, format=None, globalName=None, target=None, supported=None, platform=None, mangleProps=None, reserveProps=None, mangleQuoted=None, mangleCache=None, drop=None, minify=None, minifyWhitespace=None, minifyIdentifiers=None, minifySyntax=None, charset=None, treeShaking=None, ignoreAnnotations=None, jsx=None, jsxFactory=None, jsxFragment=None, jsxImportSource=None, jsxDev=None, jsxSideEffects=None, define=None, pure=None, keepNames=None, color=None, logLevel=None, logLimit=None, logOverride=None):\n        pass\n\n    def transform_sync(self, code, *, tsconfigRaw=None, sourcefile=None, loader=None, banner=None, footer=None, sourcemap=None, legalComments=None, sourceRoot=None, sourcesContent=None, format=None, globalName=None, target=None, supported=None, platform=None, mangleProps=None, reserveProps=None, mangleQuoted=None, mangleCache=None, drop=None, minify=None, minifyWhitespace=None, minifyIdentifiers=None, minifySyntax=None, charset=None, treeShaking=None, ignoreAnnotations=None, jsx=None, jsxFactory=None, jsxFragment=None, jsxImportSource=None, jsxDev=None, jsxSideEffects=None, define=None, pure=None, keepNames=None, color=None, logLevel=None, logLimit=None, logOverride=None):\n        # custom implementation goes here, return transformed code\n        return \"transformed code\"\n\n# These will use the custom implementation\nTypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\",\n    build_provider=CustomEsbuild()\n)\nInlineTypeScriptCode(\"let x: number = 1\",\n    transform_provider=CustomEsbuild()\n)\n```\n\nInstead of *esbuild*, the custom methods will be invoked with all computed options.\nCustom implementations can amend, change or discard any of the options.\n\nThe `IBuildProvider` integration with CDK relies on the `outdir`/`outfile` values and it's usually required to use them unchanged.\n\n`ITransformProvider` must return the transformed code as a string.\n\nFailures and warnings should be printed to stderr and thrown as the respective *esbuild* error.\n\n#### Overriding the default implementation providers\n\nThe default implementation can also be set for all usages of `TypeScriptCode` etc. in an AWS CDK app.\nYou can change the default for both APIs at once or set a different implementation for each of them.\n\n```python\nmy_custom_esbuild_provider = MyCustomEsbuildProvider()\n\nEsbuildProvider.override_default_provider(my_custom_esbuild_provider)\nEsbuildProvider.override_default_build_provider(my_custom_esbuild_provider)\nEsbuildProvider.override_default_transformation_provider(my_custom_esbuild_provider)\n\n# This will use the custom provider without the need to define it as a prop\nTypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\")\n```\n\n### Roadmap & Contributions\n\n[The project's roadmap is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/users/mrgrain/projects/1/views/7)\n\nPlease submit feature requests as issues to the repository.\nAll contributions are welcome, no matter if they are for already planned or completely new features.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Should I use this package in production?\n\nThis package is stable and ready to be used in production, as many do.\nHowever *esbuild* has not yet released a version 1.0.0 and its API is still in active development.\nPlease read the guide on [esbuild's production readiness](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#production-readiness).\n\nNote that *esbuild* minor version upgrades are also introduced in **minor versions** of this package.\nSince *esbuild* is pre v1, these versions typically introduce breaking changes and this package will inherit them.\nTo avoid this behavior, add the desired *esbuild* version as a dependency to your package.\n\n### How do I upgrade from `cdk-esbuild` v3?\n\nPlease refer to the [v4 release notes](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for a list of backwards incompatible changes and respective upgrade instructions.\n\n### [TS/JS] Why am I getting the error `Cannot find module 'esbuild'`?\n\nThis package depends on *esbuild* as an optional dependencies. If optional dependencies are not installed automatically on your system (e.g. when using npm v4-6), install *esbuild* explicitly:\n\n```console\nnpm install esbuild\n```\n\n### [TS/JS] How can I use a different version of *esbuild*?\n\nUse the [override](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json?v=true#overrides) instructions for your package manager to force a specific version, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"esbuild\": \"0.14.7\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBuild and Transform interfaces are relatively stable across *esbuild* versions.\nHowever if any incompatibilities occur, `buildOptions` / `transformOptions` can be cast to `any`:\n\n```python\nbundled_code = TypeScriptCode(\"src/handler.ts\",\n    build_options={\n        \"unsupported_option\": \"value\"\n    }\n)\n```\n\n### [Python/.NET/Go] How can I use a different version of *esbuild*?\n\nInstall the desired version of *esbuild* locally or globally [as described in the documentation above](#python-net-go).\n\nBuild and Transform interfaces are relatively stable across *esbuild* versions.\nHowever if any incompatibilities occur, use the appropriate language features to cast any incompatible `buildOptions` / `transformOptions` to the correct types.\n\n### Can I use this package in my published AWS CDK Construct?\n\nIt is possible to use `cdk-esbuild` in a published AWS CDK Construct library, but not recommended.\nAlways prefer to ship a compiled `.js` file or even bundle a zip archive in your package.\nFor AWS Lambda Functions, [projen provides an excellent solution](https://projen.io/awscdk.html#aws-lambda-functions).\n\nIf you do end up consuming `cdk-esbuild`, you will have to set `buildOptions.absWorkingDir`. The easiest way to do this, is to resolve the path based on the directory name of the calling file:\n\n```js\n// file: node_modules/construct-library/src/index.ts\nconst props = {\n  buildOptions: {\n    absWorkingDir: path.resolve(__dirname, \"..\"),\n    // now: /user/local-app/node_modules/construct-library\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThis will dynamically resolve to the correct path, wherever the package is installed. Please open an issue if you encounter any difficulties.\n\n### Can I use this package with AWS CDK v1?\n\nYes, the `2.x.x` line of `cdk-esbuild` is compatible with AWS CDK v1. You can find the [documentation for it on the v2 branch](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/tree/v2).\n\nHowever, in line with AWS CDK v2, this version release now only receives security updates and critical bug fixes and support will fully end on June 1, 2023.\n",
