    "description": "# cthmm\r\n\r\nThis is a python library for training and applying\r\n[continuous-time markov hidden markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain) (CT-HMMs).\r\nThey are a simple, but exceptionally powerful tool for extracting\r\nsignal from a stream of noisy data.\r\n\r\nIt was developed by [Field Cady](http://www.fieldcady.com).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Basic Usage\r\n\r\nA Jupyter Notebook with usage usage is [here](https://github.com/field-cady/cthmm/blob/main/CTHMM%20Examples.ipynb).\r\nThe main functionalities are to:\r\n* Create a CT-HMM with pre-defined parameters\r\n* Fit a CT-HMM to data (i.e. one or more sequences of observations, along with their timestamps)\r\n* Given a sequence of observations and timestamps, use a fitted CT-HMM to decode the underlying states\r\n    at each timestamp\r\n\r\n# TODO Items\r\n* Support for GaussianCTHMM and ExponentialCTHMM by inheriting from BaseCTHMM class\r\n* Allowing human-readable names for states\r\n* Performance improvements, possibly by converting to C or Cython\r\n* Unit testing\r\n* Add in some fitting tolerances to reduce overfitting\r\n\r\n\r\n# What is a continuous-time hidden markov model?\r\n\r\nSay you take somebody's temperate and it's in the normal range.\r\nIn isolation that suggests they are healthy rather than sick.\r\nBut if they had elevated temperatures one hour before and after,\r\nchances are that measurement was a fluke and they were actually sick the whole time.\r\n\r\nHidden markov models address this problem more generally.\r\nThere is some underlying state S of the world that varies over time\r\n(or something like time - things just have to be sequential),\r\nand you have some idea of how often S changes.\r\nYou don't know S for certain, but you have a sequence of\r\nimperfect observations O at certain points in time.\r\nYou can use O(t) to guess at S(t), but you want to use the\r\nother observations before/after t to improve on that guess.\r\n\r\nIn a traditional HMM time occurs in discrete steps:\r\nt is an integer, S(t) is either the same or different from S(t-1),\r\nand you have the accompanying observation O(t).\r\nBut in many real-world situations time flows continuously,\r\nand S can change at any moment.\r\nObservations come at irregular intervals,\r\nand they may or may not be close to the times that S changes.\r\nIf you are trying to guess S(t), the surrounding observations\r\nare more/less informative depending on how far they are from t.\r\n\r\nIn math terms a traditional HMM assumes that S is a\r\ndiscrete-time [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain),\r\nwhile a CT-HMM assumes that S is a\r\n[continuous-time markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain)\r\nand makes no assumption about what observations get taken.\r\nThe nuts-and-bolts math of a CT-HMM ends up being a lot trickier\r\nthan for a normal HMM, and partly for that reason they are not\r\nused as commonly.\r\nBut in many situations they are essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
