Depending on your needs you should install them in advance.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThis is an example scenario with two warehouses. WH2 will be allways supplied\nthrough WH1.\n\nCommon steps to `mrp` and `purchase` procurements:\n\n#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse* and set *Multi-Step\n   Routes* on.\n#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*\n#. Create **WH1** with either *Manufacture to Resupply* or *Buy to\n   Resupply* this warehouse or both set.\n#. Create **WH2** setting off *Manufacture to Resupply* and *Buy to\n   Resupply*. Set **WH1** as the *Resupply Warehouse*.\n#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Routes* and click\n   on the *Make To Order* one.\n#. Add a new *Procurement Rule* with these settings and save:\n\n   - Name: *WH1 -> WH2-MTO*\n   - Action: *Pull From*\n   - Operation Type: *WH1: Internal Transfers*\n   - Source Location: *WH1/Stock*\n   - Destination Location: *WH2/Stock*\n   - Move Supply Method: *Take From Stock*\n   - Propagation of Procurement Group: *Propagate*\n   - Propagate cancel and split: `True`\n   - Warehouse to Propagate: *WH1*\n\nNow, if you want to trigger a manufacture:\n\n   - Create a stockable product with a BoM list.\n   - In the product's *Inventory > Routes section* set *Make To Order* and\n     *Manufacture* on.\n\nOr if you want to trigger a purchase:\n\n   - Create a stockable product with a vendor.\n   - In the product's *Inventory > Routes section* set *Make To Order* and\n     *Purchase* on.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAfter configuring you procurement rules and your product routes:\n\n#. Go to *Inventory > Dashboard* and click on the *more options* icon (☰).\n#. Choose *New > Planned Transfer*.\n#. Set an origin and destination that is considered in the routes procurement\n   rules.\n#. Set *Supply Method* to *Apply Procurement Rules*.\n#. Set the products and quantities you want to supply.\n#. Save and click on *Mark as To Do*.\n#. Depending on the product's supply type a new MO or a new PO should be\n   created.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_picking_procure_method%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n    * David Vidal\n    * Pedro M.
