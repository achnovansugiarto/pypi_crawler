    "description": "The goal of the exercise is to learn how to build a package and understand the magnificence of PyPi.\n\n# https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/09/23/python-101-how-to-create-a-python-package/\n# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-build-a-python-package/\n# https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-your-first-python-package/\n# https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/python-for-hpc/tutorials/python-pypi-packaging/\n\n\n### 1 - Bringing out the __init__s ###\n\nSomething that you’ll always find in every Python package is an __init__.py file. This file will tell Python to treat directories as modules (or sub-modules).\nInside that package directory, alongside your python files, create a file called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it denotes the directory as a python package. When you pip install, this directory will be installed and become importable.\n\nVery simply, it can be empty or it will hold the names of all the methods in all the Python files that are in its immediate directory.\n\nA typical __init__.py file has the following format:\n\n> from file import method \n\n'method' is a function that is present in a file called 'file.py'\n\nWhen building packages in Python, you are required to add an __init__.py file in every sub-directory in your package. These sub-directories are the sub-modules of your package.\n\n\n### 2 - How to set up setup.py ###\n\nWithin the base-verysimplemodule folder (and in the same directory as our module verysimplemodule ), we need to add a setup.py file. This file is essential if you intend to build the actual module in question.\n\nThe setup.py file will contain information about your package, specifically the name of the package, its version, platform-dependencies and a whole lot more.\n\n\nWith that done, all we have to do next is run the following command in the same directory as base-verysimplemodule:\n\n> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n\nThis will build all the necessary packages that Python will require. The sdist and bdist_wheel commands will create a source distribution and a wheel that you can later upload to PyPi.\n\n\n### 3 - How to upload your package to PyPi ###\n\nPyPi is the official Python repository where all Python packages are stored. You can think of it as the Github for Python Packages.\n\nTo make your Python package available to people around the world, you’ll need to have an account with PyPi.\n\nWith that done, we’re all set to upload our package on PyPi. Remember the source distribution and wheel that were built when we ran python setup.py ? Well, those are what will actually be uploaded to PyPi.\n\nBut before you do that, you need to install twine if you don’t already have it installed. \n\n> pip install twine.\n\n> twine upload dist/*\n\n### 4 ###\n",
