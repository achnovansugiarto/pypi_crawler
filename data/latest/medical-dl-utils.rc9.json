For label statistics, you either need to subclass the `AbstractDiscreteLabelDataset` or implement the `get_single_label_stats` and `aggregate_label_stats` methods.\n\nAll transforms work on `torchio.data.Subjects` and can be passed to the datasets as optional parameters. You can also pass `\"default\"` as a parameter to use the default transforms.\n\nPull requests for other common utilities are highly welcomed.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis project can be installed either from PyPI or by cloning the repository from GitHub.\n\nFor an install of published packages, use the command\n\n```bash\n\n    pip install medical-dl-utils\n\n```\n\nTo install from the (cloned) repository, use the command\n\n```bash\n\n    pip install PATH/TO/medical-dl-utils\n\n```\n\nYou can also add `-e` to the command to make an editable install in case you want to modify the code.\n\nYou can also install the package directly from GitHub by running\n\n```bash\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/justusschock/medical-dl-utils.git\n\n```\n\n## Docker Images\n\nWe provide a docker image for easy usage of the package and as a base image for other projects.\n\nThe file for this image can be found at `dockers/Dockerfile`. We provide both, a CPU-only and a CUDA-enabled image based on the NVIDIA NGC PyTorch image.\nThese images can be found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/justusschock/medical-dl-utils).\n",
