It allows you to start scripts interactively from your chatrooms\nfor any reason: random humour, chatops, starting a build, monitoring commits, triggering\nalerts...\n\nIt is written and easily extensible in Python.\n\nErrbot is available as open-source software and released under the GPL v3 license.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nChat servers support\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Built-in**\n\n- IRC support\n- `Hipchat support <http://www.hipchat.com/>`_\n- `Slack support <https://slack.com/>`_\n- `Telegram support <https://www.telegram.org/>`_\n- `XMPP support <http://xmpp.org>`_\n\n**With add-ons**\n\n- `CampFire <https://campfirenow.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/errbotio/err-backend-campfire>`__)\n- `Cisco Spark <https://www.ciscospark.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/marksull/err-backend-cisco-spark>`__)\n- `Discord <https://www.discordapp.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/gbin/err-backend-discord>`__)\n- `Gitter support <https://gitter.im/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/errbotio/err-backend-gitter>`__)\n- `Matrix <https://matrix.org/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/SShrike/err-backend-matrix>`__)\n- `Mattermost <https://about.mattermost.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/Vaelor/errbot-mattermost-backend>`__)\n- `Skype <https://www.skype.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/errbotio/errbot-backend-skype>`__)\n- `TOX <https://tox.im/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/errbotio/err-backend-tox>`__)\n- `VK <https://vk.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/Ax3Effect/errbot-vk>`__)\n- `Zulip <https://zulipchat.com/>`_ (See `instructions <https://github.com/zulip/errbot-backend-zulip>`__)\n\n\nAdministration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter the initial installation and security setup, Errbot can be administered by just chatting to the bot (chatops).\n\n- install/uninstall/update/enable/disable private or public plugins hosted on git\n- plugins can be configured from chat\n- direct the bot to join/leave Multi User Chatrooms (MUC)\n- Security: ACL control feature (admin/user rights per command)\n- backup: an integrated command !backup creates a full export of persisted data.\n- logs: can be inspected from chat or streamed to Sentry.\n\nDeveloper features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Very easy to extend in Python! (see below)\n- Presetup storage for every plugin i.e. ``self['foo'] = 'bar'`` persists the value.\n- Conversation flows to track conversation states from users.\n- Webhook callbacks support\n- supports `markdown extras <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/extra.html>`_ formatting with tables, embedded images, links etc.\n- configuration helper to allow your plugin to be configured by chat\n- Graphical and text development/debug consoles\n- Self-documenting: your docstrings become help automatically\n- subcommands and various arg parsing options are available (re, command line type)\n- polling support: your can setup a plugin to periodically do something\n- end to end test backend\n- card rendering under Slack and Hipchat.\n\nCommunity and support\n---------------------\n\nIf you have:\n\n- a quick question feel free to join us on chat at `errbotio/errbot on Gitter <https://gitter.im/errbotio/errbot>`_.\n- a plugin development question please use `Stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/errbot>`_ with the tags `errbot` and `python`.\n- a bug to report or a feature request, please use our `GitHub project page <https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/issues>`_.\n\nFor more general discussion and announcements, you can join us on `google plus community <https://plus.google.com/b/101905029512356212669/communities/117050256560830486288>`_.\nYou can also ping us on Twitter with the hashtag ``#errbot``.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nErrbot runs under Python 3.3+ on Linux, Windows and Mac. For some chatting systems you'll need a key or a login for your bot to access it.\nNote: Python 2 support is still available in `errbot-4.2.x`, but it is going away.\n\nQuickstart\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe recommend to setup a `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.\n\n1. Install `errbot` from pip\n2. Make a directory somewhere (here called `errbot`) to host Errbot's data files\n3. Initialize the directory\n4. Try out Errbot in text mode\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install errbot\n    $ mkdir errbot; cd errbot\n    $ errbot --init\n    $ errbot\n\nIt will show you a prompt `>>>` so you can talk to your bot directly! Try `!help` to get started.\n\nAdding support for a chat system\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor the built-ins, just use one of those options `slack, hipchap, telegram, IRC, XMPP` with pip, you can still do it\nafter the initial installation to add the missing support for example ::\n\n   $ pip install \"errbot[slack]\"\n\nFor the external ones (Skype, Gitter, Discord etc ...), please follow their respective github pages for instructions.\n\nConfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to configure Errbot to connect to one of those chat systems you'll need to tweak the `config.py` file generated\nby `errbot --init`.\n\nTo help you, we have a documented template available here: `config-template.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/errbotio/errbot/master/errbot/config-template.py>`_.\n\nNote: even if you changed the BACKEND from the configuration, you can still use `errbot -T` and `errbot -G` to test\nout your instance locally (in text and graphic mode respectively).\n\nStarting Errbot as a daemon\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf all that worked, you can now use the -d (or --daemon) parameter to run it in a\ndetached mode:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    errbot --daemon\n\nInteracting with the Bot\n------------------------\n\nAfter starting Errbot, you should add the bot to your buddy list if you haven't already.\nYou'll need to invite the bot explicitly to chatrooms on some chat systems too.\nYou can now send commands directly to the bot!\n\nTo get a list of all available commands, you can issue:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    !help\n\nIf you just wish to know more about a specific command you can issue:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    !help command\n\nManaging plugins\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can administer the bot in a one-on-one chat if your handle is in the BOT_ADMINS list in `config.py`.\n\nFor example to keyword search in the public plugin repos you can issue:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    !repos search jira\n\nTo install a plugin from this list, issue:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    !repos install <name of repo>\n\n\nFor example `!repos install errbotio/err-imagebot`.\n\nWriting plugins\n---------------\n\nWriting your own plugins is extremely simple. `errbot --init` will have installed in the `plugins` subdirectory a plugin\ncalled `err-example` you can use as a base.\n\nAs an example, this is all it takes to create a \"Hello, world!\" plugin for Errbot:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from errbot import BotPlugin, botcmd\n\n    class Hello(BotPlugin):\n        \"\"\"Example 'Hello, world!' plugin for Errbot\"\"\"\n\n        @botcmd\n        def hello(self, msg, args):\n            \"\"\"Return the phrase \"Hello, world!\" to you\"\"\"\n            return \"Hello, world!\"\n\nThis plugin will create the command \"!hello\" which, when issued, returns \"Hello, world!\"\nto you. For more info on everything you can do with plugins, see the\n`plugin development guide <http://errbot.io/user_guide/plugin_development/>`_.\n\nContribution to Errbot itself\n-----------------------------\n\nFeel free to fork and propose changes on `github <https://www.github.com/errbotio/errbot>`_\n\n\nv5.2.0 (2018-04-04)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- backup fix : SyntaxError: literal_eval on file with statements (thx Bruno Oliveira)\n- plugin_manager: skip plugins not in CORE_PLUGIN entirely (thx Dylan Page)\n- repository search fix (thx Sijis)\n- Text: mentions in the Text backend (thx Sijis)\n- Text: double @ in replies (thx Sijis)\n- Slack: Support breaking messages body attachment\n- Slack: Add channelname to Slackroom (thx Davis Garana Pena)\n\nfeatures:\n\n- Enable split arguments on room_join so you can use \" (thx Robert Honig)\n- Add support for specifying a custom log formatter (Thx Oz Linden)\n- Add Sentry transport support (thx Dylan Page)\n- File transfert support (send_stream_request) on the Hipchat backend (thx Brad Payne)\n- Show user where they are in a flow (thx Elijah Roberts)\n- Help commands are sorted alphabetically (thx Fabian Chong)\n- Proxy support for Slack (thx deferato)\n\n\nv5.1.3 (2017-10-15)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- Default --init config is now compatible with Text backend requirements.\n- Windows: Config directories as raw string (Thx defAnfaenger)\n- Windows: Repo Manager first time update (Thx Jake Shadle)\n- Slack: fix Slack identities to be hashable\n- Hipchat: fix HicpChat Server XMPP namespace (Thx Antti Palsola)\n- Hipchat: more aggressive cashing of user list to avoid API quota exceeds (thx Roman)\n\nv5.1.2 (2017-08-26)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- Text: BOT_IDENTITY to stay optional in config.py\n- Hipchat: send_card fix for room name lookup (thx Jason Kincl)\n- Hipchat: ACL in rooms\n\nv5.1.1 (2017-08-12)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- allows spaces in BOT_PREFIX.\n- Text: ACLs were not working (@user vs user inconsistency).\n\nv5.1.0 (2017-07-24)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- allow webhook receivers on / (tx Robin Gloster)\n- force utf-8 to release changes (thx Robert Krambovitis)\n- don't generate an errbot section if no version is specified in plugin gen (thx Meet Mangukiya)\n- callback on all unknown commands filters\n- user friendly message when a room is not found\n- webhook with no uri but kwargs now work as intended\n- Slack: support for Enterprise Grid (thx Jasper)\n- Hipchat: fix room str repr.

This 4.2 branch will be the last to support Python 2. We will maintain bug fixes on it for at least\n  the end of 2016 so you can transition nicely, but please start now !\n\n  Python 3 has been released 8 years ago, now all the major distributions finally have it available, the ecosystem has\n  moved on too. This was not the case at all when we started to port Errbot to Python 3.\n\n  This will clean up *a lot* of code with ugly `if PY2`, unicode hacks, 3to2 reverse hacks all over the place and\n  packaging tricks.\n  But most of all it will finally unite the Errbot ecosystem under one language and open up new possibilities as we\n  refrained from using py3 only features.\n\n- A clarification on Errbot's license has been accepted. The contributors never intended to have the GPL licence\n  be enforced for external plugins. Even if it was not clear it would apply, our new licence exception makes sure\n  it isn't.\n  Big big thanks for the amazing turnout on this one !\n\n\nv4.2 New features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Errbot initial installation. The initial installation has been drastically simplified::\n\n    $ pip install errbot\n    $ mkdir errbot; cd errbot\n    $ errbot --init\n    $ errbot -T\n    >>>     <- You are game !!\n\n  Not only that but it also install a development directory in there so it now takes only seconds to have an Errbot\n  development environment.\n\n- Part of this change, we also made most of the config.py entries with sane defaults, a lot of those settings were\n  not even relevant for most users.\n\n- cards are now supported on the graphic backend with a nice rendering (errbot -G)\n\n- Hipchat: mentions are now supported.\n\n\nv4.2 Miscellaneous changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Documentation improvements\n- Reorganization and rename of the startup files. Those were historically the first ones to be created and their meaning\n  drifted over the years. We had err.py, main.py and errBot.py, it was really not clear what were their functions and\n  why one has been violating the python module naming convention for so long :)\n  They are now bootstrap.py (everything about configuring errbot), cli.py (everything about the errbot command line)\n  and finally core.py (everything about the commands, and dispatching etc...).\n- setup.py cleanup. The hacks in there were incorrect.\n\nv4.2 fixes\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- core: excpetion formatting was failing on some plugin load failures.\n- core: When replacing the prefix `!` from the doctrings only real commands get replaced (thx Raphael Boidol)\n- core: empty lines on plugins requirements.txt does crash errbot anymore\n- core: Better error message in case of malformed .plug file\n- Text: fix on build_identifier (thx Pawet Adamcak)\n- Slack: several fixes for identifiers parsing, the backend is fully compliant with Errbot's\n  contract now (thx Raphael Boidol and Samuel Loretan)\n- Hipchat: fix on room occupants (thx Roman Forkosh)\n- Hipchat: fix for organizations with more than 100 rooms. (thx Naman Bharadwaj)\n- Hipchat: fixed a crash on build_identifier\n\nv4.1.3 (2016-05-10)\n-------------------\n\nhotfixes:\n\n- Slack: regression on build_identifier\n- Hipchat: regression on build_identifier (query for room is not supported)\n\nv4.1.2 (2016-05-10)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- cards for hipchat and slack were not merged.\n\nv4.1.1 (2016-05-09)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- Python 2.7 conversion error on err.py.\n\nv4.1.0 (2016-05-09)\n-------------------\n\nv4.1 features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Conversation flows: Errbot can now keep track of conversations with its users and\n  automate part of the interactions in a state machine manageable from chat.\n  see `the flows documentation <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/flow_development/index.html>`_\n  for more information.\n\n- Cards API: Various backends have a \"canned\" type of formatted response.\n  We now support that for a better native integration with Slack and Hipchat.\n\n- Dynamic Plugins API: Errbot has now an official API to build plugins at runtime (on the fly).\n  see `the dynamic plugins doc <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/plugin_development/dynaplugs.html>`_\n\n- Storage command line interface: It is now possible to provision any persistent setting from the command line.\n  It is helpful if you want to automate end to end the deployment of your chatbot.\n  see `provisioning doc <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/provisioning.html>`_\n\nv4.1 Miscellaneous changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Now if no [python] section is set in the .plug file, we assume Python 3 instead of Python 2.\n- Slack: identifier.person now gives its username instead of slack id\n- IRC: Topic change callback fixed. Thx Ezequiel Brizuela.\n- Text/Test: Makes the identifier behave more like a real backend.\n- Text: new TEXT_DEMO_MODE that removes the logs once the chat is started: it is made for presentations / demos.\n- XMPP: build_identifier can now resolve a Room (it will eventually be available on other backends)\n- Graphic Test backend: renders way better the chat, TEXT_DEMO_MODE makes it full screen for your presentations.\n- ACLs: We now allow a simple string as an entry with only one element.\n- Unit Tests are now all pure py.test instead of a mix of (py.test, nose and unittest)\n\nv4.1 fixed\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Better resillience on concurrent modifications of the commands structures.\n- Allow multiline table cells. Thx Ilya Figotin.\n- Plugin template was incorrectly showing how to check config. Thx Christian Weiske.\n- Slack: DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE fix.\n- Plugin Activate was not reporting correctly some errors.\n- tar.gz packaged plugins are working again.\n\n\nv4.0.3 (2016-03-17)\n-------------------\n\nfixes:\n\n- XMPP backend compatibility with python 2.7\n- Telegram startup error\n- daemonize regression\n- UTF-8 detection\n\nv4.0.2 (2016-03-15)\n-------------------\n\nhotfixes:\n\n- configparser needs to be pinned to a 3.5.0b2 beta\n- Hipchat regression on Identifiers\n- Slack: avoid URI expansion.\n\nv4.0.1 (2016-03-14)\n-------------------\n\nhotfixes:\n\n- v4 doesn't migrate plugin repos entries from v3.\n- py2 compatibility.\n\nv4.0.0 (2016-03-13)\n-------------------\n\nThis is the next major release of errbot with significant changes under the hood.\n\n\nv4.0 New features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Storage is now implemented as a plugin as well, similar to command plugins and backends.\n  This means you can now select different storage implementations or even write your own.\n\nThe following storage backends are currently available:\n\n  + The traditional Python `shelf` storage.\n  + In-memory storage for tests or ephemeral storage.\n  + `SQL storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-sql>`_ which supports relational databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Redshift etc.\n  + `Firebase storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-firebase>`_ for the Google Firebase DB.\n  + `Redis storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-redis>`_ (thanks Sijis Aviles!) which uses the Redis in-memory data structure store.\n\n- Unix-style glob support in `BOT_ADMINS` and `ACCESS_CONTROLS` (see the updated `config-template.py` for documentation).\n\n- The ability to apply ACLs to all commands exposed by a plugin (see the updated `config-template.py` for documentation).\n\n- The mention_callcack() on IRC (mr. Shu).\n\n- A new (externally maintained) `Skype backend <https://github.com/errbotio/errbot-backend-skype>`_.\n\n- The ability to disable core plugins (such as `!help`, `!status`, etc) from loading (see `CORE_PLUGINS` in the updated `config-template.py`).\n\n- Added a `--new-plugin` flag to `errbot` which can create an emply plugin skeleton for you.\n\n- IPv6 configuration support on IRC (Mike Burke)\n\n- More flexible access controls on IRC based on nickmasks (in part thanks to Marcus Carlsson).\n  IRC users, see the new `IRC_ACL_PATTERN` in `config-template.py`.\n\n- A new `callback_mention()` for plugins (not available on all backends).\n\n- Admins are now notified about plugin startup errors which happen during bot startup\n\n- The repos listed by the `!repos` command are now fetched from a public index and can be\n  queried with `!repos query [keyword]`. Additionally, it is now possible to add your own\n  index(es) to this list as well in case you wish to maintain a private index (special\n  thanks to Sijis Aviles for the initial proof-of-concept implementation).\n\n\nv4.0 fixed\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- IRC backend no longer crashes on invalid UTF-8 characters but instead replaces\n  them (mr. Shu).\n\n- Fixed joining password-protected rooms (Mikko Lehto)\n\n- Compatibility to API changes introduced in slackclient-1.0.0 (used by the Slack backend).\n\n- Corrected room joining on IRC (Ezequiel Hector Brizuela).\n\n- Fixed *\"team_join event handler raised an exception\"* on Slack.\n\n- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on HipChat.\n\n- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on Slack.\n\n- Fixed `GROUPCHAT_NICK_PREFIXED` not prefixing the user on regular commands.\n\n- Fixed `HIDE_RESTRICTED_ACCESS` from accidentally sending messages when issuing `!help`.\n\n- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on IRC.\n\n- Fixed markdown rendering breaking with `GROUPCHAT_NICK_PREFIXED` enabled.\n\n- Fixed `AttributeError` with `AUTOINSTALL_DEPS` enabled.\n\n- IRC backend now cleanly disconnects from IRC servers instead of just cutting the connection.\n\n- Text mode now displays the prompt beneath the log output\n\n- Plugins which fail to install no longer remain behind, obstructing a new installation attempt\n\n\nv4.0 Breaking changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The underlying implementation of Identifiers has been drastically refactored\n  to be more clear and correct. This makes it a lot easier to construct Identifiers\n  and send messages to specific people or rooms.\n\n- The file format for `--backup` and `--restore` has changed between 3.x and 4.0\n  On the v3.2 branch, backup can now backup using the new v4 format with `!backupv4` to\n  make it possible to use with `--restore` on errbot 4.0.\n\nA number of features which had previously been deprecated have now been removed.\nThese include:\n\n- `configure_room` and `invite_in_room` in `XMPPBackend` (use the\n  equivalent functions on the `XMPPRoom` object instead)\n\n- The `--xmpp`, `--hipchat`, `--slack` and `--irc` command-line options\n  from `errbot` (set a proper `BACKEND` in `config.py` instead).\n\n\nv 4.0 Miscellaneous changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Version information is now specified in plugin `.plug` files instead of in\n  the Python class of the plugin.\n\n- Updated `!help` output, more similar to Hubot's help output (James O'Beirne and Sijis Aviles).\n\n- XHTML-IM output can now be enabled on XMPP again.\n\n- New `--version` flag on `errbot` (mr. Shu).\n\n- Made `!log tail` admin only (Nicolas Sebrecht).\n\n- Made the version checker asynchronous, improving startup times.\n\n- Optionally allow bot configuration from groupchat\n\n- `Message.type` is now deprecated in favor of `Message.is_direct` and `Message.is_group`.\n\n- Some bundled dependencies have been refactored out into external dependencies.\n\n- Many improvements have been made to the documention, both in docstrings internally as well\n  as the user guide on the website at http://errbot.io.\n\n\nFurther info on identifier changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Person, RoomOccupant and Room are now all equal and can be used as-is to send a message\n  to a person, a person in a Room or a Room itself.\n\nThe relationship is as follow:\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/errbotio/errbot/master/docs/_static/arch/identifiers.png\n   :target: https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/blob/master/errbot/backends/base.py\n\nFor example: A Message sent from a room will have a RoomOccupant as frm and a Room as to.\n\nThis means that you can now do things like:\n\n- `self.send(msg.frm, \"Message\")`\n- `self.send(self.query_room(\"#general\"), \"Hello everyone\")`\n\n\n\n.. v9.9.9 (leave that there so master doesn't complain)\n\n\n",
