    "description": "# dda\nThe data API provides access to any database for which it is enabled. The API represents databases, views, view entries, and documents in JSON format.  **Important**: This version of the OpenAPI spec (**data.yaml**) includes data API changes from the XPages Extension Library release 9.0.1.v09_02. This  includes new operations on attachments, agents and forms.  If you are using a version before 9.0.1.v09_02, consider using an earlier version of the spec. \n\nThis Python package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:\n\n- API version: 9.0.1\n- Package version: 1.0.0\n- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen\n\n## Requirements.\n\nPython 2.7 and 3.4+\n\n## Installation & Usage\n### pip install\n\nIf the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com//.git\n```\n(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com//.git`)\n\nThen import the package:\n\n```python\nimport dda \n```\n\n### Setuptools\n\nInstall via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).\n\n```sh\npython setup.py install --user\n```\n(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)\n\nThen import the package:\n\n```python\nimport dda\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport time\nimport dda\nfrom dda.rest import ApiException\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic\nconfiguration = dda.Configuration()\nconfiguration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'\nconfiguration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'\n\n# create an instance of the API class\napi_instance = dda.AgentApi(dda.ApiClient(configuration))\nfolder = 'folder_example'  # str | Database folder name relative to the Domino data directory.  If the database is not in a folder, use `.` to specify the data directory itself. \ndatabase = 'database_example'  # str | Database file name.\nagent_job = dda.AgentJob()  # AgentJob | The agent job
