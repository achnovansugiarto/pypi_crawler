    "description": "rERPy is a Python toolkit for doing ERP/ERF analysis of brainwave data\n(EEG, MEG), using both traditional averaging-based ERP/ERF estimation,\nand a fancy new `regression-based technique for ERP/ERF estimation,\nwhich we call rERP/rERF <http://vorpus.org/rERP>`_. rERPs can do\nanything ERPs can do -- in fact, ERPs are special cases of rERPs;\nevery ERP is also a rERP. But rERPs are much more powerful. rERPs make\nit straightforward to analyze experimental designs that use a mix of\ncategorical and continuous manipulations, even when these\nmanipulations are partially confounded or produce non-linear effects,\nand they can separate out overlapping waveforms timelocked to\ntemporally adjacent events. They can even do all these things at the\nsame time. Nonetheless, they are relatively simple to use.\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/rerpy/rerpy.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/rerpy/rerpy\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/rerpy/rerpy/badge.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/rerpy/rerpy?branch=master\n\nDocumentation:\n  http://rerpy.readthedocs.org/\n\nDownloads:\n  not yet\n\nDependencies:\n  * Python 2.7 (not Python 3 yet, sorry -- patches accepted!)\n  * numpy\n  * scipy\n  * pandas\n  * patsy\n\nIf you're starting from scratch (not previously a Python user), then\nwe recommend `installing a scientific Python distribution\n<http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_.\n\nOptional dependencies:\n  * nose: needed to run tests\n\nInstall:\n  probably not a great idea yet\n\nMailing list:\n  not yet, but in the mean time you can hassle nathaniel.smith@ed.ac.uk\n\nCode and bug tracker:\n  https://github.com/rerpy/rerpy\n\nLicense:\n  GPLv2+, see LICENSE.txt for details.",
