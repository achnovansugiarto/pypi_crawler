Alphalens works great with the\n[Zipline](https://www.zipline.ml4trading.io/) open source backtesting library, and [Pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio) which provides performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios.\n\nThe main function of Alphalens is to surface the most relevant statistics and plots about an alpha factor, including:\n\n- Returns Analysis\n- Information Coefficient Analysis\n- Turnover Analysis\n- Grouped Analysis\n\n# Getting started\n\nWith a signal and pricing data creating a factor \\\"tear sheet\\\" is a two step process:\n\n```python\nimport alphalens\n\n# Ingest and format data\nfactor_data = alphalens.utils.get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns(my_factor,\n                                                                   pricing,\n                                                                   quantiles=5,\n                                                                   groupby=ticker_sector,\n                                                                   groupby_labels=sector_names)\n\n# Run analysis\nalphalens.tears.create_full_tear_sheet(factor_data)\n```\n\n# Learn more\n\nCheck out the [example notebooks](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/alphalens-reloaded/tree/master/alphalens/examples)\nfor more on how to read and use the factor tear sheet.\n\n# Installation\n\nInstall with pip:\n\n    pip install alphalens-reloaded\n\nInstall with conda:\n\n    conda install -c ml4t alphalens-reloaded\n\nInstall from the master branch of Alphalens repository (development code):\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/stefan-jansen/alphalens-reloaded\n\nAlphalens depends on:\n\n- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)\n- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)\n- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)\n- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)\n- [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)\n- [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels)\n\n# Usage\n\nA good way to get started is to run the examples in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n\nTo get set up with an example, you can:\n\nRun a Jupyter notebook server via:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook\n```\n\nFrom the notebook list page(usually found at `http://localhost:8888/`), navigate over to the examples directory, and open any file with a .ipynb extension.\n\nExecute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it and hitting Shift+Enter.\n\n# Questions?\n\nIf you find a bug, feel free to open an issue on our [github tracker](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/alphalens-reloaded/issues).\n\n# Contribute\n\nIf you want to contribute, a great place to start would be the\n[help-wanted issues](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/alphalens-reloaded/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n\n# Credits\n\n- [Andrew Campbell](https://github.com/a-campbell)\n- [James Christopher](https://github.com/jameschristopher)\n- [Thomas Wiecki](https://github.com/twiecki)\n- [Jonathan Larkin](https://github.com/marketneutral)\n- Jessica Stauth (<jstauth@quantopian.com>)\n- [Taso Petridis](https://github.com/tasopetridis)\n\nFor a full list of contributors see the [contributors page.](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/alphalens-reloaded/graphs/contributors)\n\n# Example Tear Sheets\n\nExample factor courtesy of [ExtractAlpha](https://extractalpha.com/)\n\n## Peformance Metrics Tables\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/4T8cziG.png)\n\n## Returns Tear Sheet\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/aVs3KiM.png)\n\n## Information Coefficient Tear Sheet\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/vAm8okb.png)\n\n## Sector Tear Sheet\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/pnBs0ta.png)\n",
