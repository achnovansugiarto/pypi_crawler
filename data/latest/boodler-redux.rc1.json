    "description": "Boodler Redux: A programmable soundscape tool\n\nDesigned by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>\n   <http://boodler.org/>\n\nRecent work (3.0.0 and above) by Beau Gunderson <beau@beaugunderson.com>\n   <https://beaugunderson.com/>\n\nCopyright 2001-2011 by Andrew Plotkin\n   This program is distributed under the LGPL.\n   See the LGPL document, or the above URL, for details.\n\n## WHAT IT IS\n\nBoodler is a tool for creating soundscapes -- continuous, infinitely\nvarying streams of sound. Boodler is designed to run in the background\non a computer, maintaining whatever sound environment you desire.\n\nBoodler is extensible, customizable, and modular. Each soundscape is a\nsmall piece of Python code -- typically less than a page. A soundscape\ncan incorporate other soundscapes; it can combine other soundscapes,\nswitch between them, fade them in and out. This package comes with\nmany example soundscapes. You can use these, modify them, combine them\nto arbitrary levels of complexity, or write your own.\n\nBoodler is written in Python, with the driver module (cboodle_stdout)\nwritten in C. It was developed under Python 3.\n\nBoodler can generate audio output to one destination:\n\n- stdout: write raw sample output to stdout\n\nBoodler does not come with any warranty of any sort whatsoever.\n\n## GETTING STARTED\n\nBoodler is now distributed as a standard Python setuptools package.\nIf you have downloaded the source code, you need only type:\n\n```python\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nFor more information, point your web browser at the contents of the\ndocumentation folder (doc/index.html in this package) and follow the\n\"Installation\" link.\n\nNote that the Boodler is not distributed with any soundscapes. You\nmust download those separately. See the \"Running Boodler\" link in the\ndocumentation folder.\n\n## LICENSING FOR USERS\n\n(Running Boodler)\n\nBoodler is free software, and you may run it freely. (Portions of the\nBoodler source code are copyrighted and licensed under the LGPL or the\nGPL, and other portions are public domain. Neither of these restrict\nyou in any way from running the program.)\n\nHowever, there is another legal issue. Boodler operates by executing\nsoundscape code, which combines sound-sample files into a ongoing\nstream of sound. Legally speaking, when you run Boodler, you are\ncreating a derivative work based on those code fragments and sound\nfiles.\n\nThe soundscapes and sound files in the Boodler package library are\n*not* all in the public domain. Many are licensed \"for non-commercial\nuse only\". Some of the sound files were found by random searching\naround the web, and appear without any copyright statement at all.\n\nIt is my opinion (*not* backed by any legal advice) that if you run\nBoodler for your own private use, using packages downloaded from the\nBoodler library, then you are within the scope of fair use and the\n\"non-commercial use\" licenses of those sounds.\n\nHowever, if you play the sound output of Boodler (based on the Boodler\npackage library) as a commercial performance, or include it in a\nrecording sold for profit, you may not be complying with the copyright\nrestrictions on those sounds. You will have to look at the license\nterms of the packages you use, and decide whether your performance is\nlegal.\n\nNote that this legal issue is a problem of playing sounds and\nsoundscapes from the Boodler package library. It is not a restriction\nof the Boodler software itself. If you create your own Boodler\nsoundscape, based solely on *your own* sound-sample files and code,\nthen that stream of sound is entirely your own work; you may do with\nit as you wish.\n\n## LICENSING FOR SOUNDSCAPE DESIGNERS\n\n(Creating new soundscapes)\n\nThe sound and soundscape packages in the org.boodler section of the\npackage library (excluding org.boodler.old) are in the public domain.\nThey are intended to be used as code samples as well as soundscapes.\nYou may modify, extend, combine, and pervert them as you wish.\n\nThe sound packages in the org.boodler.old section of the package\nlibrary are copyrighted, but free for non-commercial use. They are not\nfree for commercial use.\n\nSound packages elsewhere in the library (not under org.boodler) are\nfree for non-commercial use. They may or may not be free for\ncommercial use, modification, and other forms of derivative work. See\nthe terms of each package for details.\n\nIf you create sound files or soundscape code for use with Boodler, you\nmay license them as you wish -- GPL, LGPL, Creative Commons, some\nother license. Or you might choose to not release them at all; you are\nnot obligated to do so.\n\n## LICENSING FOR SOUNDSCAPE CONTRIBUTORS\n\n(Putting your work in the Boodler library)\n\nYou are welcome to contribute your sounds and soundscapes to the\nBoodler project. Any properly-formatted package file will be accepted\ninto the Boodler package library, as long as it is free for users to\nenjoy.\n\nYou are also welcome to repackage and contribute other people's\nsounds, as long as their licenses permit you to do so.\n\nTo be accepted, a package must be, at minimum, free for non-commercial\nuse. The Boodler project strongly encourages contributions to be either\nplaced in the public domain, or licensed under an open-source or\nCreative Commons license.\n\n## LICENSING FOR PROGRAMMERS\n\n(Modifying Boodler and incorporating it into other software)\n\nI consider Boodler to be more like a software component than a\nstand-alone program. Accordingly, I have released it under the GNU\nLibrary General Public License (the LGPL). To be precise, the\nworkhorse parts of Boodler -- the boodle and boopak Python packages --\nform a library, which is licensed under the LGPL.\n\nThe Python program boodler is simply a shell that starts up the\nBoodler library. I have released this program into the public domain.\nYou may do with it as you like. However, understand that if you write\na program that is intended to link in the Boodler library (regardless\nof whether you use the boodler script), then your program is a work that\nuses the library, and must behave appropriately. See the LGPL document\nfor details.\n\nOne detail: the C source code of the cboodle extensions is\ndual-licensed. You may use it under the terms of the LGPL or the GPL,\nwhichever you like.\n\n\n",
