The program can either be given a list of authors \nto look for publications for, or references/citations to publications themselves. \nThe program will then will look for publications on the aforementioned sources \nand return what relevant information is available from those sources.\n\nThe primary use case is to give the program a list of authors to find publications \nfor. From this list of publications it can then be determined which ones need \nfurther action to be in compliance.\n\nA secondary use case for finding author's publications is to create a report of \nthe collaborators they have worked with, and can be done by specifying the creation \nof that report in the configuration file. Details on reports are in the `documentation <https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/reporting.html>`__.\n\nThe other primary use case is to give the program a list of publication references \nto find information for.\n\nLinks\n~~~~~\n\n   * Academic Tracker @ GitHub_\n   * Academic Tracker @ PyPI_\n   * Documentation @ Pages_\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Academic Tracker package runs under Python 3.7+. Use pip_ to install.\nStarting with Python 3.4, pip_ is included by default. Be sure to use the latest \nversion of pip as older versions are known to have issues grabbing all dependencies. \nAcademic Tracker relies on sendmail to send emails, so if you need to use that \nfeature be sure sendmail is installed and in PATH.\n\n\nInstall on Linux, Mac OS X\n--------------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   python3 -m pip install academic_tracker\n\n\nInstall on Windows\n------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   py -3 -m pip install academic_tracker\n   \n\nUpgrade on Linux, Mac OS X\n--------------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   python3 -m pip install academic_tracker --upgrade\n   \n\nUpgrade on Windows\n------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   py -3 -m pip install academic_tracker --upgrade\n\n\n\nQuickstart\n~~~~~~~~~~\nAcademic Tracker has several commands and options. The simplest most common use \ncase is simply:\n\n.. code:: bash\n    \n    academic_tracker author_search config_file.json\n\nAcademic Tracker's behavior can be quite complex though, so it is highly encouraged \nto read the `guide <https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/guide.html>`_ \nand `tutorial <https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/tutorial.html>`_.\n\n\nCreating The Configuration JSON\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA configuration JSON file is required to run Academic Tracker, but initially creating \nit the first time can be burdensome. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for \nthis. It is encouraged to read the configuration JSON section in `jsonschema <https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/jsonschema.html>`_ \nand use the example there to create it initially. The add_authors command can help \nwith building the Authors section if you already have a csv file with author \ninformation. A good tool to help track down pesky JSON syntax errors is `here <https://csvjson.com/json_validator>`__.\n\n\nRegistering With ORCID\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn order to have this program search ORCID you must register with ORCID and obtain \na key and secret. Details on how to do that are `here <https://info.orcid.org/documentation/integration-guide/registering-a-public-api-client/>`__. \nIf you do not want to do that then the --no_ORCID option can be used to skip searching \nORCID.\n\n          \nMac OS Note\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhen you try to run the program on Mac OS you may get an SSL error.\n\n    certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate\n    \nThis is due to a change in Mac OS and Python. To fix it go to to your Python \nfolder in Applications and run the Install Certificates.command shell command \nin the /Applications/Python 3.x folder. This should fix the issue.\n\n\nEmail Sending Note\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAcademic Tracker uses sendmail to send emails, so any system it is going to be \nused on needs to have sendmail installed and the path in PATH. If you try to \nsend emails without this the program will display a warning. This can be avoided \nby using the --test option though. The --test option blocks email sending. Email \nsending can also be avoided by leaving the from_email attribute out of the report \nsections of the configuration JSON file.\n\n\nHow Authors Are Identified\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhen searching by authors it is necessary to confirm that the author given to \nAcademic Tracker matches the author returned in the query. In general this matching \nis done by matching the first and last names and at least one affiliation given \nfor the author in the configuration JSON file. Note that affiliations can change \nover time as authors move, so they may need many affiliations to accurately match \nthem to their publications depending on how far back you want to search in time.\n\n\nHow Publications Are Matched\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhen searching by publications it is necessary to confirm that the publication \nin the given reference matches the publication returned in the query. This is done \nby either matching the DOIs, PMIDs, or the title and at least one author. Titles \nare fuzzy matched using fuzzywuzzy which is why at least one author must also be \nmatched. Author's are matched using last name and at least one affiliation.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\nThis package is distributed under the BSD `license`.\n\n\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/academic_tracker\n.. _Pages: https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/academic_tracker\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io",
