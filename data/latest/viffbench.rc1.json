    "description": "ViffBench is a set of scripts that makes it easy to write, execute, and\nvisulize benchmarks of VIFF protocols. Features include\n\n* Benchmarking using arbitrary VIFF revisions.\n\n* Based on ssh and thus benefits from key agents like ssh-agent.\n\n* Benchmarking of distributed VIFF protocols as well as local VIFF code.\n\n* Automatically stores benchmark results in central database.\n\n* Stores benchmark results for every single run, e.g. no info is lost.",
