[Installation](#installation)\n4. [Manual](#manual)\n5. [Test files](#package)\n6. [Contact](#contact)\n\n\n----\n\n### Introduction <a name=\"content\"></a>\n\nChemGAPP encompasses three modules, each with a dedicated Streamlit App.\n\n\n\n#### ChemGAPP Big\nThis package is for the quality control analysis of large chemical genomic screen data. Since many issues can arise during chemical genomic screens, such as pinning mistakes and edge effects, this package aims to improve the quality of the inputted data. It achieves this via the normalisation of plate data and by performing a series of statistical analyses for the removal of detrimental replicates or conditions. Following this, it is able to score data and assign fitness scores (S-scores). The statistical analyses included are: the Z-score test, the Mann-Whitney test, and condition variance analysis. \n\n#### ChemGAPP Small\n\nChemGAPP_Small has been produced to deal with small scale chemical genomic screens where replicates are within the plate. This differs from large chemical genomic screen where replicates are across multiple plates. ChemGAPP Small produces three types of plots, a heatmap, bar plots and swarm plots. For the bar plot and heatmap, ChemGAPP Small compares the mean colony size of within plate replicates to the mean colony size of the within plate wildtype replicates, producing a fitness ratio. The bar plots are then optionally grouped by strain or by condition. The heatmap displays all conditions and strains. For the swarm plots each mutant colony size is divided by the mean colony size of the wildtype, to produce the fitness ratio. A one-way ANOVA and Tukey-HSD analysis determines the significance in difference between each mutant fitness ratio distribution and the wildtype fitness ratio distribution. colony size can be substituted for any IRIS phenotype.\n\n\n#### ChemGAPP GI\n\nChemGAPP GI focuses on the analysis of genetic interaction studies. ChemGAPP GI calculates the fitness ratio of two single mutant strains and a double knockout in comparison to the wildtype. It also calculates the expected double knockout fitness ratio for comparison to the observed fitness ratio. ChemGAPP GI displays this data as a bar plot. \n\n------\n\n### License <a name=\"license\"></a>\n\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

E.g:\n\n```\niris_to_dataset [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUTPUTFILE]\n```\n\n###### Python files are initiated using the python command. The help instruction is called using -h option. E.g:\n```\npython Iris_to_Dataset.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUTPUTFILE]\n```\n\n###### Bin files are intiated by specifying the path to the file. E.g, if within the files' directory:\n\n```\n./Iris_to_Dataset [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUTPUTFILE]\n```\n\n`Colony Size is stated as the phenotype within the below examples for ease. However, any Iris phenotype (e.g opacity, circularity etc) can be analysed`\n\n#### iris_to_dataset <a name=\"Iris_to_dataset\"></a>\n\nTakes a directory of Iris files and turns them into the combined .csv dataset used for normalisation. \n\nInput files do not have to be from IRIS as long as they are in the IRIS format and named in the format below.\n\nThe IRIS file format is a tab delimited tabular file starting with columns for plate locations, followed by measured phenotypes. E.g:\n\n| row |\tcolumn|\tsize | circularity | opacity |\n|  ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | :-------------: |\n| 1 |\t1\t| 12348\t | 0.549 | 512559 |\n| 1 |\t2\t| 11786\t | 0.572 | 509877 |\n| 1 |\t3\t| 11265\t | 0.578 | 488846 |\n\nIris file names MUST be in the format: \n\n`CONDITION-concentration-platenumber-batchnumber_replicate.JPG.iris`\n\nE.g. `AMPICILLIN-50 mM-6-1_B.JPG.iris`\n\nWhere concentrations have decimals, use a comma instead of a period:\n\nE.g. `AMPICILLIN-0,5 mM-6-1_B.JPG.iris`\n\nWhere a concentration is not relevant, put two dashes between condition and plate number:\n\nE.g. `LB--1-2_A.JPG.iris`\n\nIf only one source plate and/or only one batch was produced, assign 1 for these:\n\nE.g. `AMPICILLIN-0,5 mM-1-1_B.JPG.iris`\n\n`platenumber` refers to the source plate number, i.e which mutants are on the experiment plate. This will match the plate information file number in later steps.\n\n\n```\nusage: iris_to_dataset [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUTPUTFILE]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\nRequired arguments:\n  -p PATH, --PATH PATH  \n                        Path to folder which contains IRIS files, IRIS file names should be in the format: CONDITION-concentration-platenumber-batchnumber_replicate.JPG.iris (default:None)\n\n  -o OUTPUTFILE, --outputfile OUTPUTFILE\n                        Name of output file, should be a .csv file (default:None)\n\n  -it IRISPHENOTYPE, --IRISphenotype IRISPHENOTYPE\n                        IRIS phenotype from IRIS files you wish to analyse (default: size)\n\n```\n    \n#### check_normalisation <a name=\"Check_Normalisation\"></a>\n\nChecks each plate individually to see if outer-edge normalisation is required due to plate effects. The module uses the wilcoxson rank sum test to determine if the distribution of outer edge colony sizes, e.g colony size, are the same as the inner colony sizes. If the distributions differ, the outer edge is normalised such that the row or column median of each outer edge colony is equal to the Plate Middle Mean (PMM). The PMM is equal to the mean colony size of all colonies within the middle of the plate within the 40th to 60th percentile of size. Following this, all plates are normalised such that all colonies are scaled to adjust the PMM to the medain colony size of all colonies within the dataset. \n\nFalse zero values, are also changed to NaNs, false zero values are values where a colony has a size of zero but other replicates within the condition are not. This is likely due to pinning defects. \n\n```\nusage: check_normalisation [-h] [-i INPUTFILE] [-o OUTPUTFILE]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\nRequired arguments:\n  -i INPUTFILE, --InputFile INPUTFILE\n                        The txt file from Iris_to_dataset.py of the colony dataset with conditions across the top and row/column coordinates downwards (default: None)\n  -o OUTPUTFILE, --OutputFile OUTPUTFILE\n                        CSV file of the normalised colony sizes.

ChemGAPP Small produces three types of plots, a heatmap, bar plots and swarm plots. For the bar plot and heatmap, ChemGAPP Small compares the mean colony size of within plate replicates to the mean colony size of the within plate wildtype replicates, producing a fitness ratio. The bar plots are then optionally grouped by strain or by condition. The heatmap displays all conditions and strains. For the swarm plots each mutant colony size is divided by the mean colony size of the wildtype, to produce the fitness ratio. A one-way ANOVA and Tukey-HSD analysis determines the significance in difference between each mutant fitness ratio distribution and the wildtype fitness ratio distribution.\n\nEnsure IRIS file names are in the format: `CONDITION-concentration-platenumber_replicate.JPG.iris`\n\nE.g. `AMPICILLIN-50mM-6_B.JPG.iris`\n\nWhere concentrations have decimals, use a comma instead of a period:\n\nE.g. `AMPICILLIN-0,5mM-6_B.JPG.iris`\n\n```\nusage: chemgapp_small [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUTPUTFILE_PREFIX]\n                      [-pf PLATEINFOPATH] [-m MAX_COLONY_SIZE] [-wt WILDTYPE]\n                      [-cd CONDITION] [-it IRIS_TYPE]\n                      [-col_plot COLOURPALETTE] [-col_heat COLOURHEATMAP]\n                      [-wd WIDTH] [-ht HEIGHT] [-hwd HEATMAP_WIDTH]\n                      [-hht HEATMAP_HEIGHT] [-hs HEATMAP_FONTSIZE]\n                      [-r ROTATION] [-cs CIRCLESIZE] [-g GROUP] [-pt PLOTTYPE]\n                      [-rm REMOVE_STRAIN] [-ymax Y_MAX] [-ymin Y_MIN]\n\nAnalyses small scale chemical genomic screen data\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -p PATH, --PATH PATH  Path to folder which contains IRIS files (default:\n                        None)\n  -o OUTPUTFILE_PREFIX, --outputfile_prefix OUTPUTFILE_PREFIX\n                        Path and prefix for output file (default: None)\n  -pf PLATEINFOPATH, --PlateInfoPath PLATEINFOPATH\n                        The path to the folder containing the plate info\n                        files.
