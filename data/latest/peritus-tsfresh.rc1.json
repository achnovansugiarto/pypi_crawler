The abbreviation stands for\n\n*\"Time Series Feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis tests\"*.\n\nThe package provides systematic time-series feature extraction by combining established algorithms from statistics, time-series analysis, signal processing, and nonlinear dynamics with a robust feature selection algorithm. In this context, the term *time-series* is interpreted in the broadest possible sense, such that any types of sampled data or even event sequences can be characterised.\n\n## Spend less time on feature engineering\n\nData Scientists often spend most of their time either cleaning data or building features.\nWhile we cannot change the first thing, the second can be automated.\n*TSFRESH* frees your time spent on building features by extracting them automatically.\nHence, you have more time to study the newest deep learning paper, read hacker news or build better models.\n\n\n## Automatic extraction of 100s of features\n\n*TSFRESH* automatically extracts 100s of features from time series.\nThose features describe basic characteristics of the time series such as the number of peaks, the average or maximal value or more complex features such as the time reversal symmetry statistic.\n\n![The features extracted from a exemplary time series](docs/images/introduction_ts_exa_features.png)\n\nThe set of features can then be used to construct statistical or machine learning models on the time series to be used for example in regression or\nclassification tasks.\n\n## Forget irrelevant features\n\nTime series often contain noise, redundancies or irrelevant information.\nAs a result most of the extracted features will not be useful for the machine learning task at hand.\n\nTo avoid extracting irrelevant features, the *TSFRESH* package has a built-in filtering procedure.\nThis filtering procedure evaluates the explaining power and importance of each characteristic for the regression or classification tasks at hand.\n\nIt is based on the well developed theory of hypothesis testing and uses a multiple test procedure.\nAs a result the filtering process mathematically controls the percentage of irrelevant extracted features.\n\nThe  *TSFRESH* package is described in the following open access paper:\n\n* Christ, M., Braun, N., Neuffer, J., and Kempa-Liehr A.W. (2018).\n   _Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests (tsfresh -- A Python package)._\n   Neurocomputing 307 (2018) 72-77, [doi: 10.1016/j.neucom.2018.03.067](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2018.03.067).\n\nThe FRESH algorithm is described in the following whitepaper:\n\n* Christ, M., Kempa-Liehr, A.W., and Feindt, M. (2017).\n    _Distributed and parallel time series feature extraction for industrial big data applications._\n    ArXiv e-print 1610.07717,  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07717](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07717).\n\nDue to the fact that tsfresh basically provides time-series feature extraction for free, you can now concentrate on engineering new time-series,\nlike e.g. differences of signals from synchronous measurements, which provide even better time-series features:\n\n* Kempa-Liehr, A.W., Oram, J., Wong, A., Finch, M., Besier, T. (2020).\n    _Feature engineering workflow for activity recognition from synchronized inertial measurement units._\n    In: Pattern Recognition. ACPR 2019. Ed. by M. Cree et al. Vol. 1180. Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS).\n    Singapore: Springer 2020, 223–231. [doi: 10.1007/978-981-15-3651-9_20](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3651-9_20).\n\nSystematic time-series features engineering allows to work with time-series samples of different lengths, because every time-series is projected\ninto a well-defined feature space. This approach allows the design of robust machine learning algorithms in applications with missing data.\n\n* Kennedy, A., Gemma, N., Rattenbury, N., Kempa-Liehr, A.W.
