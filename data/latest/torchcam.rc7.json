Each CAM object acts as a wrapper around your model.\n\nYou can find the exhaustive list of supported CAM methods in the [documentation](https://frgfm.github.io/torch-cam/methods.html), then use it as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define your model\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet18\nmodel = resnet18(pretrained=True).eval()\n\n# Set your CAM extractor\nfrom torchcam.methods import SmoothGradCAMpp\ncam_extractor = SmoothGradCAMpp(model)\n```\n\n*Please note that by default, the layer at which the CAM is retrieved is set to the last non-reduced convolutional layer. If you wish to investigate a specific layer, use the `target_layer` argument in the constructor.*\n\n\n\n### Retrieving the class activation map\n\nOnce your CAM extractor is set, you only need to use your model to infer on your data as usual. If any additional information is required, the extractor will get it for you automatically.\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.io.image import read_image\nfrom torchvision.transforms.functional import normalize, resize, to_pil_image\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet18\nfrom torchcam.methods import SmoothGradCAMpp\n\nmodel = resnet18(pretrained=True).eval()\ncam_extractor = SmoothGradCAMpp(model)\n# Get your input\nimg = read_image(\"path/to/your/image.png\")\n# Preprocess it for your chosen model\ninput_tensor = normalize(resize(img, (224, 224)) / 255., [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n\n# Preprocess your data and feed it to the model\nout = model(input_tensor.unsqueeze(0))\n# Retrieve the CAM by passing the class index and the model output\nactivation_map = cam_extractor(out.squeeze(0).argmax().item(), out)\n```\n\nIf you want to visualize your heatmap, you only need to cast the CAM to a numpy ndarray:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Visualize the raw CAM\nplt.imshow(activation_map[0].squeeze(0).numpy()); plt.axis('off'); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()\n```\n\n![raw_heatmap](https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam/releases/download/v0.1.2/raw_heatmap.png)\n\nOr if you wish to overlay it on your input image:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom torchcam.utils import overlay_mask\n\n# Resize the CAM and overlay it\nresult = overlay_mask(to_pil_image(img), to_pil_image(activation_map[0].squeeze(0), mode='F'), alpha=0.5)\n# Display it\nplt.imshow(result); plt.axis('off'); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()\n```\n\n![overlayed_heatmap](https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam/releases/download/v0.1.2/overlayed_heatmap.png)\n\n## Setup\n\nPython 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are required to install TorchCAM.\n\n### Stable release\n\nYou can install the last stable release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/torchcam/) as follows:\n\n```shell\npip install torchcam\n```\n\nor using [conda](https://anaconda.org/frgfm/torchcam):\n\n```shell\nconda install -c frgfm torchcam\n```\n\n### Developer installation\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to use the latest features of the project that haven't made their way to a release yet, you can install the package from source:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam.git\npip install -e torch-cam/.\n```\n\n\n\n## CAM Zoo\n\nThis project is developed and maintained by the repo owner, but the implementation was based on the following research papers:\n\n- [Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04150): the original CAM paper\n- [Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391): GradCAM paper, generalizing CAM to models without global average pooling. \n- [Grad-CAM++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11063): improvement of GradCAM++ for more accurate pixel-level contribution to the activation.\n- [Smooth Grad-CAM++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01224): SmoothGrad mechanism coupled with GradCAM.\n- [Score-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01279): score-weighting of class activation for better interpretability.\n- [SS-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14255): SmoothGrad mechanism coupled with Score-CAM.\n- [IS-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03023): integration-based variant of Score-CAM.\n- [XGrad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02312): improved version of Grad-CAM in terms of sensitivity and conservation.\n- [Layer-CAM](http://mftp.mmcheng.net/Papers/21TIP_LayerCAM.pdf): Grad-CAM alternative leveraging pixel-wise contribution of the gradient to the activation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a alt=\"wallaby_video_cam\">\n        <img src=\"https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam/releases/download/v0.2.0/video_example_wallaby.gif\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZJN5BzKfxk\">YouTube video</a> (activation maps created by <a href=\"https://frgfm.github.io/torch-cam/latest/methods.html#torchcam.methods.LayerCAM\">Layer-CAM</a> with a pretrained <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet18\">ResNet-18</a>)</em>\n</p>\n\n\n\n## What else\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe full package documentation is available [here](https://frgfm.github.io/torch-cam/) for detailed specifications.\n\n### Demo app \n\nA minimal demo app is provided for you to play with the supported CAM methods!
