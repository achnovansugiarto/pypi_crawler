    "description": "This module implements a very fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python, that\r\n    also will serialize and de-serialize objects information in the style of\r\n    pickle.  Thus allowing for objects to be easily transported over the wire.\r\n\r\n    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text based lightweight\r\n    data exchange format which is easy for humans to read/write and for machines\r\n    to parse/generate. JSON is completely language independent and has multiple\r\n    implementations in most of the programming languages, making it ideal for\r\n    data exchange and storage.\r\n\r\n    The module is written in C and it is up to 250 times faster when compared to\r\n    the other python JSON implementations which are written directly in python.\r\n    This speed gain varies with the complexity of the data and the operation and\r\n    is the the range of 10-200 times for encoding operations and in the range of\r\n    100-250 times for decoding operations.",
