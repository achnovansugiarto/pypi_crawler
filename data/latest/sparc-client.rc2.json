This basically refers to any section in brackets that stores configuration variables. In this case it refers to 'ci' section.\n\nWithin each section, different configuration variables could be defined. In our case, the only variable that needs to be defined is pennsieve_profile_name, which is passed to the Pennsieve2 library.\n\n\n\n# Module automatic import\n\nEach python file in services/ folder with defined class name that is derived from BaseService is imported as a module to SparcClient class.\nFor example, pennsieve.py file \n\n```python\nfrom sparc.client import SparcClient\na = SparcClient(connect=False, config_file='config.ini')\nmodule = a.pennsieve.connect()\nmodule.user.whoami() #execute internal functions of the module\n\n# alternatively connect all the services available\na.connect()  #connect to all services\n\n```\n\n# Contribution Guide\n\n1. Define configuration variables in config.ini file (e.g  api_key, api_secret etc.)\n2. Create a file in services/\n3. Create a class within this file that extends BaseService\n4. The class needs to define all the functions required + may add its own.\n",
