    "description": "# MIxS:\n\nA specification for the **Minimum Information about any (X) Sequence** standard\n\n## Repository Contents\n\nThis repo contains computable artifacts that define the MIxS standard, versions 6 and later. _Older versions of the MIxS standard are available at https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs-legacy_\n\nBeginning with version 6, MIxS is being managed using the [LinkML toolkit](https://linkml.io/). LinkML uses YAML files to describe schemas and provides code to convert YAML to multiple other formats. \n\n### How to access MIxS standards\n\nThe standards can be browsed at https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/. The latests stable version of the MIxS standard in various formatsdownloaded in machine readable formats from the [release](release) folder.  MIxS is currently available in GraphQL, JSON-LD, JSON schema, OWL, prefixmap, protobuf, SCHACL, SHEX, SQL schema and Python. Java will be addde in a future release, as will Excel templates for data collection. There is currently only one version of MIxS released in this repository (MIxS 6). When newer versions are released, links to older versions will be provided here\n\nTo support existing implementers who have been using previous Excel-based versions of MIxS, we have provide a manually created [Excel workbook](release/excel) with the same format as MIxS 5. However, we highly recommend using one of the machine readable artifacts available in the [release](release) folder.\n\nMIxS is divided into checklists and packages.\n\n**[Checklists](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#checklists)** include the require, recommended, and optional metadata fields for a specific type sequence: genome, metagenome, marker gene, or xxx. For genomic sequences (MIGS), there are checklists for specific taxa (Eukaryotes, Bacteria, Viruses, and Plants as hosts).\n\n**[Packages](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#packages)** supplement checklists by providing additional terms to describe specific environements in which a sample was collected. For example, the Agriculture package has a number of terms to describe agricultural environments. \n\nPackages can be used in conjunction with any checklist, so, for example, you if you sequence metagenome with in an agricultural environment, you would use MIMS + the Agriculture packages. All possible [combinations](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#combinations) of checklists and packages are available on the web browser.\n\n\n**To request changes to the MIxS standards, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues) in this repo.**\n\n### Other repository contents\n\n- [generated](generated) contains a working version of the MIxS artifacts. It is not stable and should not be used!\n- [doc_templates](doc_templates) contains jinja templates for the LinkML auto-generated documentation\n- [changelogs](changelogs) contains documents describing the changes with each release\n- [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) provides more technical details on the editing and release process\n\n## Guidelines for the reuse and citation of content on this repository\n\nThe MIxS standards and the content of this repo are freely available under the [Creative Commons 0 (open source)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) agreement. \n\n### Cite this repo\n\nIf you reuse code from this repository, please site the [repository URL](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs)\n\n\n### Cite the standard\n\nIf you use any of the MIxS standards, please site [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1823):\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1823\n\nOr, in [RIS format](citation.ris)\n\n\n## General Background\nWithout specific guidelines, most genomic, metagenomic and marker gene sequences in databases are sparsely annotated with the information required to guide data integration, comparative studies and knowledge generation. Even with complex keyword searches, it is currently impossible to reliably retrieve sequences that have originated from certain environments or particular locations on Earth—for example, all sequences from ‘soil’ or ‘freshwater lakes’ in a certain region of the world. Because public databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC; comprising DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), the European Nucleotide Archive (EBI-ENA) and [GenBank](http://www.insdc.org/) depend on author-submitted information to enrich the value of sequence data sets, we argue that the only way to change the current practice is to establish a standard of reporting that requires contextual data to be deposited at the time of sequence submission. The adoption of such a standard would elevate the quality, accessibility and utility of information that can be collected from INSDC or any other data repository.\n\nThe GSC has defined a set of core descriptors for genomes and metagenomes in the form of a MIGS/MIMS specification. MIGS/MIMS extends the minimum information already captured by the INSDC. The recently introduced MIMARKS now captures information about marker genes. Additionally, we also introduced ‘environmental packages’ that standardize sets of measurements and observations describing particular habitats that are applicable across all GSC checklists and beyond. We define ‘environment’ as any location in which a sample or organism is found, e.g., soil, air, water, human-associated, plant-associated or laboratory. The original MIGS/MIMS checklists included contextual data about the location from which a sample was isolated and how the sequence data were produced. However, standard descriptions for a more comprehensive range of environmental parameters, which would help to better contextualize a sample, were not included. The environmental packages presented here are relevant to any genome sequence of known origin and are designed to be used in combination with MIGS, MIMS and MIMARKS checklists.\n\nTo create a single entry point to all minimum information checklists from the GSC and to the environmental packages, we created an overarching framework, the MIxS standard . MIxS includes the technology-specific checklists from the previous MIGS and MIMS standards, provides a way of introducing additional checklists such as MIMARKS, and also allows annotation of sample data using environmental packages.\n\nThe adoption of the GSC standards by major data providers and organizations, as well as the INSDC, supports efforts to contextually enrich sequence data and complements recent efforts to enrich other (meta) ‘omics data. The MIxS standards have been developed to the point that it is ready for use in the publication of sequences. A defined procedure for requesting new features and stable release cycles will facilitate implementation of the standard across the community. Compliance among authors, adoption by journals and use by informatics resources will vastly improve our collective ability to mine and integrate invaluable sequence data collections for knowledge- and application-driven research.\n\n",
