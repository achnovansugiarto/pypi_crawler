The API of lab uses type hints and it works well with IDEs.\n\nWe introduced configurations module to lab recently.\nConfigurations let you set hyper-parameters and other reusable modules.\nUsing this API, we were able to reuse a lot of code in\ninternal machine learning projects.\n\nConfigurations module helps to stay away from a range of common bad practices.\n`For example, passing around a large monolithic configuration object, and having a big class that does everything <https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g1vku4/d_antipatterns_in_open_sourced_ml_research_code/>`_.\n\nWe have released some common configurable components such as ``TrainingLoop`` and ``Datasets``.\nIt is very easy to hack our components or write new reusable components.\n\nHere's how you can write a MNIST classifier with reusable components.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vpj/lab/master/images/full@0.5x.png\n   :width: 100%\n   :alt: Code improvement\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    pip install machine_learning_lab\n\n\n",
