    "description": "# Description\nPython implementation of model-based image coregistration \nfor quantitative medical imaging applications. \n\nThe distribution comes with a number of common signal models and uses [ITK-Elastix](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKElastix) for deformable image registration.\n\n***CAUTION: mdreg is developed in public but is work in progress and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. It is likely there WILL be breaking changes in future versions***\n\n## Installation\nRun `pip install mdreg`. \n\n## Example data\nExample data in [DICOM format](https://shorturl.at/rwCUV) are provided for testing the setup.\n\n## How to run\nInput data must be image arrays in numpy format, with dimensions `(x,y,z,t)` or `(x,y,t)`. \nTo perform MDR on an image array `im` with default settings do: \n\n```python\nfrom mdreg import MDReg\n\nmdr = MDReg()\nmdr.set_array(im)\nmdr.fit()\n```\n\nThese default settings will apply a linear signal model and coregistration \nas defined in the elastix parameter file `Bsplines.txt`. \n\n## Outputs\nWhen fitting is complete the following data are available:\n\n- `mdr.coreg`: motion-corrected data are in the same dimensions as the original `im`. \n- `mdr.deformation`: the calculated deformation fields in format `(x,y,d,t)` or `(x,y,z,d,t)`. The dimension `d` holds `x`, `y` components of the deformation field. The third `z` component exists if the input array is 3D. \n- `mdr.fit`: the model fit to the coregistered images in the same dimensions `(x,y,z,t)` or `(x,y,t)` as the original `im`. \n- `mdr.par`: the fitted parameters are in dimensions `(x,z,p)` or `(x,y,z,p)` (for 3D data), where `p` enumerates the model parameters.\n\n# Customization\n\nMDR can be configured to apply different signal models and elastix coregistration settings.\nA number of example models and alternative elastix parameter files are included \nin the distribution as templates.\n\nThe following example fits a mono-exponential decay, uses a mask `im_mask` for co-registration and applies an elastix parameter file `par_file` optimized for a previous DTI-MRI study:\n\n```python\nfrom mdreg import MDReg\nfrom mdreg.models import exponential_decay\n\nmdr = MDReg()\nmdr.set_array(im)\nmdr.set_mask(im_mask)\nmdr.signal_model = exponential_decay\nmdr.read_elastix(par_file)\nmdr.fit()\n```\n\n`im_mask` must be a binary (0's and 1's) or boolean (True's and False's) image array in numpy format with the same dimensions as `im`.\n\nThe signal model often depends on fixed constants and signal parameters \nsuch as sequence parameters in MRI, or patient-specific constants. These \nshould all be grouped in a list and set before running the signal model. \n\nEqually elastix parameters can be fine tuned, either by importing a \ndedicated elastix file, or by modifying the settings. \n\nYou may also choose if you wish to run the process in multiple cores (`parallel`) and to print the co-registration progress to the terminal plus a text file (`log`) or not.\n\nThen, a number of parameters are available to optimize MDR such as \nthe precision (stopping criterion) and maximum number of iterations.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```python\nfrom mdreg import MDReg\nfrom mdreg.models import exponential_decay\n\nt = [0.0, 1.25, 2.50, 3.75]     # time points for exponential in sec\n\nmdr = MDReg()\nmdr.set_array(im)\nmdr.signal_parameters = t\nmdr.signal_model = exponential_decay\nmdr.set_elastix(MaximumNumberOfIterations = 256)   # change defaults\nmdr.precision = 0.5         # default = 1\nmdr.max_iterations = 3      # default = 5\nmdr.parallel = False        # default = True\nmdr.log = True              # default = False\nmdr.fit()\n```\n\n`mdreg` comes with a number of options to \nexport results and diagnostics:\n\n```python\nmdr.export_unregistered = True      # export parameters and fit without registration\nmdr.export_path = filepath          # default is a results folder in the current working directory\nmdr.export()                        # export results after calling fit. \n```\n\nThis export creates movies of original images, motion corrected images, \nmodelfits, and maps of the fitted parameters.\n\n# Model fitting without motion correction\n\n`MDReg` also can be used to perform model fitting \nwithout correcting the motion. The following script \nfits a linearised exponential model to each pixel and exports data \nof model and fit:\n\n```python\nfrom mdreg import MDReg\nfrom mdreg.models import exponential_decay\n\nmdr = MDReg()\nmdr.set_array(im)\nmdr.signal_model = linear_exponential_decay\nmdr.fit_signal()\nmdr.export_data()\nmdr.export_fit()\n```\n\n# Defining new MDR models\n\nA model must be defined as a separate module or class with two required functions `main()` and `pars()`.\n\n`pars()` must return a list of strings specifying the names of the model parameters.\n`main(im, const)` performs the pixel based model fitting and has two required arguments. \n`im` is a numpy ndarray with dimensions `(x,y,z,t)`, `(x,y,t)` or `(x,t)`. `const` is a list \nof any constant model parameters.\n\nThe function must return the fit to the model as an numpy ndarray with the same dimensions \nas `im`, and an ndarray `pars` with dimensions `(x,y,z,p)`, `(x,y,p)` or `(x,p)`. Here `p` enumerates \nthe model parameters. \n\n## Context\n\n`mdreg` was first developed for use in quantitative renal MRI in the iBEAt study, \nand validated against group-wise model-free registration \n(Tagkalakis F, et al. Model-based motion correction outperforms a model-free method in quantitative renal MRI. Abstract-1383, ISMRM 2021).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe iBEAt study is part of the BEAt-DKD project. The BEAt-DKD project has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 115974. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA with JDRF.
