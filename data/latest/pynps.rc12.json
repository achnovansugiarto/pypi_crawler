It's basically a command line version of [NPSBrowser](https://nopaystation.com/vita/npsReleases/) writen by a moron (aka me).\n\n# This project wouldn't be possible without the help of these folks\n* [Nopaystation](https://nopaystation.com/): for making our beloved database this software hooks on\n* [mmozeiko](https://github.com/mmozeiko/pkg2zip): for making the original pkg2zip\n* [lusid1](https://github.com/lusid1/pkg2zip): for forking pkg2zip and making theme extraction great again\n* [BertrandHustle](https://github.com/BertrandHustle/psx_scraper): for coding a python solution to detect names on PSX's EBOOT that's used in this software\n* [Contributors](https://github.com/evertonstz/pynps/graphs/contributors): for helping with pull requests.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  * [Binary](#binary)\n  * [Using PIP](#using-pip)\n  * [pkg2zip](#pkg2zip)\n  * [wget](#wget)\n  * [Windows](#windows)\n- [Updating database](#updating-database)\n  * [Updating all databases](#updating-all-databases)\n  * [Updating database per console](#updating-database-per-console)\n  * [Updating database, even more fragmented](#updating-database-even-more-fragmented)\n  * [Database file](#database-file)\n- [Configuration file](#configuration-file)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n  * [Searching](#searching)\n  * [Syntax for selecting files to download](#syntax-for-selecting-files-to-download)\n  * [Resuming downloads](#resuming-downloads)\n  * [More information](#more-information)\n- [Make a donation](#make-a-donation)\n  * [Paypal](#paypal)\n  * [Crypto](#crypto)\n******\n# Installation\nThere are tree methods you can install pyNPS:\n\n## Using PIP\nThis is for both 32 and 64bits systems. All you need is python 3.7 or newer alongside PIP:\n\n>pip install pynps\n\nMake sure to also install pkg2zip and wget (this should already be installed in most Linux distros tho).\n\n******\n# pkg2zip\nThis script uses lusid1's pkg2zip, as [recomended by NoPayStation](https://twitter.com/NoPayStation/status/1096508850080043010), to handle the .pkg extractions, you have 3 options:\n\n1. Use pre-compied binary, compiled by myelf (version 2.2) [here](https://pixeldrain.com/u/qJ05A7Si), just drop it inside `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/` and make it executable by runing:\n\n    > chmod -R +x /home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/pkg2zip\n\n\n2. If you're an Arch user, you can compile it from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pkg2zip-fork/) after you install it pyNPS will autodetect and use it automatically, no need to add the path to your config file, the yay command is:\n\n    >$ yay -S pkg2zip-fork\n\n3. Or you can just grab the sources from lusid1's repo and compile it yourself [here](https://github.com/lusid1/pkg2zip/releases) and move the binary into this folder `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/`.\n\nFor methods 1 and 3 pyNPS will autodetect and use it automatically, so there's no need to add the path to your config file\n\nIn case you decide to store your binary outside `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/` you'll need to specify this folder in your config file unde the \"pkg2zip_location\" option.\n\n******\n# wget\nThis software uses wget to make the downloads therefore it won't work if you don't have it installed in your system, most distros already come with wget installed, if you don't have it chances are you're on some crazy non-userfriendly distro and you probably know your way around for installing it. If you don't just google.\n\nYou can drop a wget binary at `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/` after that pyNPS will autodetect and use it automatically, no need to add the path to your config file.\n\nIn case you decide to store your binary outside `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/lib/` you'll need to specify this folder in your config file unde the \"wget_location\" option.\n******\n# Windows\nTL;DR: install with the windows installer (available at [releases page](https://github.com/evertonstz/pynps/releases)) as administrator (aka select \"install for every user in this PC\" when you run the installer), open CMD and start using by typing `pynps`. More info about download directories and config files can be found in [these notes](https://github.com/evertonstz/pynps/releases/tag/1.6.2)\n\nThe Windows installer comes bundled with wget and pkg2zip and when installed as administrator it'll also include itself on PATH (if not the user will need to add it manually). There's also a portable binary and Windows can also install it with pip. More infor is found in [these notes](https://github.com/evertonstz/pynps/releases/tag/1.6.2).\n\nPeople on Windows that don't actually care about command line stuff can also try [NPSBrowser](https://nopaystation.com/vita/npsReleases/).\n\n******\n# Updating database\nBefore downloading any of your legally obtained (wink wink wink) pkg file you have to update your NPS database, you don't have to do it every time you want to download something, but only in your first run to construct your initial database and after that just once in a while to get info about new pkgs NPS adds to their database:\n\n## Updating all databases\n>$ pynps -u\n\n\n## Updating database per console\n\nupdates only vita's db\n>$ pynps -c psv -u\n\nOr:\n\n>$ pynps -uc psv\n\nYou can do the same for psp, psx and psm.\n\n## Updating database, even more fragmented\n\nUpdates only games and themes database for psp and psx (note: since there's no themes database for psx, only the games db will be updated for this system):\n>$ pynps -c psp -u -GT\n\nOr:\n\n>$ pynps -GTuc psp\n\nUpdates only games database for every system:\n>$ pynps -u -G\n\nOr:\n>$ pynps -Gu\n\n## Database file\n\nDatabase is located by default at `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/database/pynps.db`\n******\n# Configuration file\nConfiguration file is created at `/home/$USER/.config/pyNPS/settings.ini`\n\nIf you delete it, it'll be recreated with default parameters in the next run. The options are pretty much self explanatory.\n\n******\n# Examples\n## Searching\n******\nSearch for an european release of Crash for PSX and PSP\n>$ pynps --console psp --console psx --region eur --games crash\n\nOr:\n>$ pynps -c psp -c psx -r eur -G crash\n```\n1  ) PSP | NPEG00020 | EU   | GAMES   | Gravity Crash Portable | 46.09 MiB\n2  ) PSP | NPEZ00305 | EU   | GAMES   | 3,2,1…SuperCrash!
