    "description": "# Classroom-tool\n\nThis package provides a script, `classroom-tool` which is designed to work with\n[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to automate some of the tasks\nan instructor might have in marking work submitted on that platform.\n\nThe assumed workflow is that students undertake a GitHub classroom assignment,\nwhich they push to GitHub by a given date and time. The instructor(s) mark the\nwork on a separate, private, GitHub repository. This repository contains one\npull request per student, which enables the instructor(s) to mark the work by\ncommenting on the pull request. The instructors' comments are returned to the\nstudents by creating PDFs of the annotated pull requests.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package using:\n\n```console\n$ pip install classroom-tool\n```\n\n## GitHub personal access token\n\n`classroom-tool` will need to access GitHub in order to work, and to do so it\nwill need to be able to authenticate to GitHub. You will therefore need to set\nup a GitHub [personal access\ntoken](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\nwith `repo` permissions. Store the PAT in the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable\nso that `classroom-tool` can access it.\n\n## Setting up the GitHub assignment\n\nWhen configuring the assignment on GitHub Classroom, ensure that you select\n`Enable feedack pull requests`. `classroom-tool` will need these as the base\nfor the marking pull requests in the marking repository.\n\n## Configuration file\n\nConfiguration information which is constant for a particular marking exercise\nneeds to be provided in a configuration file in\n[ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) format. A\nsimple example follows.\n\n```\n[students]\nroster = classroom_roster.csv\n\n[github]\norganization = my-org\nbasename = exam-2021\nmarking-repo = marking-exam-2021\n\n[assignment]\ndeadline = 2021-05-26T12:00:00+01:00\n```\n\n### students\n\nThis section contains information about the students taking the exercise.\n\n`roster` is a `.csv` (comma-separated values) file with at least the following\ncolumns. These are present in the roster you can download from GitHub classroom:\n\n`identifier`: The identifier of the student at your institution, such as a\nstudent number or username.\n\n`github_username`: The GitHub username of the student.\n\nAny other columns will be preserved in output. The following optional column\nhas special meaning:\n\n`extra_time`: The additional time allowed to a student in minutes (for example\nas a result of a disability). This can be blank for students with no additional\ntime.\n\n### github\n\nThis section contains the (non-sensitive) GitHub information about the\nassignment.\n\n`organization`: The name of the GitHub organization containing the classroom.\n\n`basename`: The GitHub classroom prefix for the current assignment.\n\n`marking-repo`: The name of the repository in which the marking branches and\npul requests will be created. This is in the same organization. The marking\nrepository should be an initially empty, **private** repository. Its name\nshould not start with `basename`.\n\n`delay`: The number of seconds to wait between creating pull requests. Set or\nincrease this if you find you are hitting GitHub secondary rate limits when\nrunning with the `--pull-requests` option. Defaults to 10 seconds.\n\n### assignment\n\nInformation specific to this assignment.\n\n`deadline`: The submission deadline in iso 8601 time and data format.\n\nNote that GitHub does not record push times, so this is the timestamp on the\nlast commit which will be accepted.\n\n## classroom-tool usage\n\n`classroom-tool` assumes a sequential processing of the submissions, with\npotential manual intervention at each stage to cater for anomolous inputs or\ncircumstances.\n\nThe basic usage is:\n```\nclassroom-tool --config-file CONFIG_FILE\n```\nwith `CONFIG_FILE` replaced by the name of the configuration file. By itself,\nthis will do nothing. Actual processing is achieved by adding the options for\none or more of the following, stages. A help message is available by passing\n`--help`.\n\n### Fetching repositories\n\nPassing `--fetch` will fetch all the existant student branches from GitHub.\n\n### Creating local branches\n\nPassing `--create-branches` will create local branches with name\n`identifier-main` (or `identifier-master`) and `identifier-feedback`. Here,\n`identifier` is taken from the class roster in the configuration file, as\nopposed to the GitHub username. If the identifier is anonymous (such as a\nstudent number), this forms the first stage in anonymising the submissions.\n\n### Imposing the deadline\n\nPassing `--impose-deadline` will create local branches with names of the form\n`identifier-mark`. These branches will point to the last commit before the\ndeadline specified in the configuration file. In the current version of\n`classroom-tool`, extra time is not automatically accounted for at this stage:\nyou will need to manually move the branch pointer in these cases. For example\nif student 123456 had additional time and you wish to mark their very last\ncommit rather than the last commit before the deadline, you would run:\n```\ngit branch -f 123456-mark 123456-main\n```\n\n### Creating a submission report\n\nPassing `--create-report` will create a `csv` file with a name of the form\n`marking-repo-report.csv` containing all of the columns from the roster file,\nplus the following:\n\n`commit_time`: The timestamp of the last commit on the student's `main` (or\n`master`) branch.\n\n`late`: True if `commit_time` is after the deadline. This field **does** take\ninto account extra time.\n\n`cloned`: True if the student accepted the assignment on GitHub.\n\n`submitted`: True if the student pushed at least one commit.\n\nThis report is indended to assist in identifying students who may have had\ntechnical or other issues.\n\n### Pushing to the marking repository.\n\nPassing `--push` will push all of the local, `-main`, `-master`, `-feedback`,\nand `-mark` branches to the marking repository on GitHub.\n\n### Creating marking pull requests.\n\nPassing `--pull-requests` will create a pull request for each student in the\nmarking repository on GitHub. This pull request will compare the `-mark` branch\nwith `-feedback`. Creating pull requests is intentionally throttled to once per\nthree seconds in order to avoid triggering GitHub rate limits when working with\nlarge classes.\n\n### Cutting down the GitHub spam\n\nWhen running a big course, one can easily be overwhelmed by notifications from\nall of the classroom repositories. It is possible to unwatch everything\nmanually, but that's too much clicking. This can be overcome with:\n```\nclassroom-tool --unwatch\n```\nThis unsubscribes the logged-in user from all repositories in the configured\nclassroom that match the configured basename.\n\n## Anonymising the repository\n\nRemapping the repository names to university identity numbers is not enough to\nanonymise the submissions, because every commit has author information. \n\nFortunately, [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) can\nfix this. The following code will anonymise all commits in the repository:\n\n```\ngit-filter-repo --email-callback 'return b\"anon@anon.eu\"' --force --name-callback 'return b\"Anonymous\"'\n```\n\nNote that this action will rewrite *all* the commits in the repository. This\nmeans that none of the branches in the marking repository will share any\nhistory with the student repositories from which they were copied. This means\nthat you probably only want to take this step once you are sure that all the\nother steps have been successfully completed. If you have already pushed the\nbranches to GitHub then you will need to force push the anonymised branches:\n\n```\nclassroom-tool --push --force\n```",
