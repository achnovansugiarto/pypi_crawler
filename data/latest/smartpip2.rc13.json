The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n**Table of contents**\n\n- [Project Focus](#project-focus)\n- [Principles](#principles)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\n- [Installing from PyPI](#installing-from-pypi)\n- [Official source code](#official-source-code)\n- [Convenience packages](#convenience-packages)\n- [User Interface](#user-interface)\n- [Semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning)\n- [Version Life Cycle](#version-life-cycle)\n- [Support for Python and Kubernetes versions](#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Who uses Apache Airflow?](#who-uses-apache-airflow)\n- [Who Maintains Apache Airflow?](#who-maintains-apache-airflow)\n- [Can I use the Apache Airflow logo in my presentation?](#can-i-use-the-apache-airflow-logo-in-my-presentation)\n- [Airflow merchandise](#airflow-merchandise)\n- [Links](#links)\n- [Sponsors](#sponsors)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n## Project Focus\n\nAirflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it allows for clarity around unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).\n\nAirflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e. results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [Xcom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#xcoms)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services that specialize on that type of work.\n\nAirflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Dynamic**:  Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.\n- **Extensible**:  Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.\n- **Elegant**:  Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow using the powerful **Jinja** templating engine.\n- **Scalable**:  Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers.\n\n## Requirements\n\nApache Airflow is tested with:\n\n|                      | Main version (dev)        | Stable version (2.1.2)   |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| Python               | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9        | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9       |\n| Kubernetes           | 1.20, 1.19, 1.18          | 1.20, 1.19, 1.18         |\n| PostgreSQL           | 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13       | 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13      |\n| MySQL                | 5.7, 8                    | 5.7, 8                   |\n| SQLite               | 3.15.0+                   | 3.15.0+                  |\n| MSSQL(Experimental)  | 2017,2019                 |                          |\n\n**Note:** MySQL 5.x versions are unable to or have limitations with\nrunning multiple schedulers -- please see the [Scheduler docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/scheduler.html).\nMariaDB is not tested/recommended.\n\n**Note:** SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend\nusing the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.\n\n## Getting started\n\nVisit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with\n[installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation.html),\n[getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/index.html), or walking\nthrough a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial.html).\n\n> Note: If you're looking for documentation for main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).\n\nFor more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit\nthe [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals).\n\nDocumentation for dependent projects like provider packages, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).\n\n## Installing from PyPI\n\nWe publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky\nbecause Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open and\napplications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both at the same time. We decided to keep\nour dependencies as open as possible (in `setup.py`) so users can install different versions of libraries\nif needed. This means that from time to time plain `pip install apache-airflow` will not work or will\nproduce unusable Airflow installation.\n\nIn order to have repeatable installation, however, we also keep a set of \"known-to-be-working\" constraint\nfiles in the orphan `constraints-main`, `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those \"known-to-be-working\"\nconstraints files separately per major/minor Python version.\nYou can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify\ncorrect Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL.\n\n\n1. Installing just Airflow:\n\n> Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.\n\nWhile they are some successes with using other tools like [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or\n[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as\n`pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.\nInstalling via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.\n\nIf you wish to install airflow using those tools you should use the constraint files and convert\nthem to appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.\n\n\n```bash\npip install apache-airflow==2.1.2 \\\n --constraint \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.1.2/constraints-3.7.txt\"\n```\n\n2. Installing with extras (for example postgres,google)\n\n```bash\npip install apache-airflow[postgres,google]==2.1.2 \\\n --constraint \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.1.2/constraints-3.7.txt\"\n```\n\nFor information on installing provider packages check\n[providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).\n\n## Official source code\n\nApache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project,\nand our official source code releases:\n\n- Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)\n- Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)\n- Are cryptographically signed by the release manager\n- Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the\n  [Release Approval Process](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)\n\nFollowing the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the\nrelease provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools.\n\n\n## Convenience packages\n\nThere are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are \"convenience\" methods - they are\nnot \"official releases\" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users\nwho do not want to build the software themselves.\n\nThose are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow:\n\n- [PyPI releases](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool\n- [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow) to install airflow via\n  `docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm` etc. You can\n  read more about using, customising, and extending the images in the\n  [Latest docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/production-deployment.html), and\n  learn details on the internals in the [IMAGES.rst](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/IMAGES.rst) document.\n- [Tags in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tags) to retrieve the git project sources that\n  were used to generate official source packages via git\n\nAll those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources.\nSome of those artifacts are \"development\" or \"pre-release\" ones, and they are clearly marked as such\nfollowing the ASF Policy.\n\n## User Interface\n\n- **DAGs**: Overview of all DAGs in your environment.\n\n  ![DAGs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/dags.png)\n\n- **Tree**: Tree representation of a DAG that spans across time.\n\n  ![Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/tree.png)\n\n- **Graph**: Visualization of a DAG's dependencies and their current status for a specific run.\n\n  ![Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/graph.png)\n\n- **Task Duration**: Total time spent on different tasks over time.\n\n  ![Task Duration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/duration.png)\n\n- **Gantt**: Duration and overlap of a DAG.\n\n  ![Gantt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/gantt.png)\n\n- **Code**:  Quick way to view source code of a DAG.\n\n  ![Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/code.png)\n\n\n## Semantic versioning\n\nAs of Airflow 2.0.0, we support strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach for all packages released.\n\nThere are few specific rules that we agreed to, that define details of versioning of the different\npackages:\n\n* **Airflow**: SemVer rules apply to core airflow only (excludes any changes to providers).\n  Changing limits for versions of Airflow dependencies is not a breaking change on its own.\n* **Airflow Providers**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the particular provider's code only.\n  SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the packages are independent from Airflow version.\n  For example `google 4.1.0` and `amazon 3.0.3` providers can happily be installed\n  with `Airflow 2.1.2`. If there are limits of cross-dependencies between providers and Airflow packages,\n  they are present in providers as `install_requires` limitations. We aim to keep backwards\n  compatibility of providers with all previously released Airflow 2 versions but\n  there will be sometimes breaking changes that might make some, or all\n  providers, to have minimum Airflow version specified. Change of that minimum supported Airflow version\n  is a breaking change for provider, because installing the new provider might automatically\n  upgrade Airflow (which might be undesired side effect of upgrading provider).\n* **Airflow Helm Chart**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the chart only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR\n  versions for the chart are independent from the Airflow version. We aim to keep backwards\n  compatibility of the Helm Chart with all released Airflow 2 versions, but some new features might\n  only work starting from specific Airlfow releases. We might however limit the Helm\n  Chart to depend on minimal Airflow version.\n* **Airflow API clients**: SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions follow MAJOR and MINOR version of Airflow.\n  The first MAJOR or MINOR X.Y.0 release of Airflow should always be followed by X.Y.0 release of\n  all clients. The clients then can release their own PATCH releases with bugfixes,\n  independently of Airflow PATCH releases.\n\n## Version Life Cycle\n\nApache Airflow version life cycle:\n\n| Version | Current Patch/Minor | State     | First Release | Limited Support | EOL/Terminated |\n|---------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| 2       | 2.1.2               | Supported | Dec 17, 2020  | Dec 2021        | TBD            |\n| 1.10    | 1.10.15             | EOL       | Aug 27, 2018  | Dec 17, 2020    | June 17, 2021  |\n| 1.9     | 1.9.0               | EOL       | Jan 03, 2018  | Aug 27, 2018    | Aug 27, 2018   |\n| 1.8     | 1.8.2               | EOL       | Mar 19, 2017  | Jan 03, 2018    | Jan 03, 2018   |\n| 1.7     | 1.7.1.2             | EOL       | Mar 28, 2016  | Mar 19, 2017    | Mar 19, 2017   |\n\nLimited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.\nEOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.\nWe always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.\nWe **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before EOL date.\n\n## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions\n\nAs of Airflow 2.0 we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support.\nThey are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the\n[Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and\n[Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).\n\n1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. We drop support for those\n   EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release the\n   first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow\n   For example for Python 3.6 it means that we drop support in main right after 23.12.2021, and the first\n   MAJOR or MINOR version of Airflow released after will not have it.\n\n2. The \"oldest\" supported version of Python/Kubernetes is the default one. \"Default\" is only meaningful\n   in terms of \"smoke tests\" in CI PRs which are run using this default version and default reference\n   image available. Currently ``apache/airflow:latest`` and ``apache/airflow:2.1.2` images\n   are both Python 3.6 images, however the first MINOR/MAJOR release of Airflow release after 23.12.2021 will\n   become Python 3.7 images.\n\n3. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we\n   make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with\n   new versions of Python mostly) we release a new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.\n\n### Additional notes on Python version requirements\n\n* Previous version [requires](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8162) at least Python 3.5.3\n  when using Python 3\n\n## Contributing\n\nWant to help build Apache Airflow?
