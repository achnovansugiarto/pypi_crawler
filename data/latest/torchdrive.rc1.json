    "description": "# ![torchdrive](media/torchdrive.svg)\n\nA PyTorch library for training BEV style perception models for self driving\ntasks. This is unaffiliated with the PyTorch project. This currently includes\nhelpful primitives needed to put together a model.\n\n## Install from Source\n\n```\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/d4l3k/torchdrive.git\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/d4l3k/torchdrive.git\n$ cd torchdrive\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\n## Background\n\nI've been documenting the process for this code. Please see my blog at\nhttps://fn.lc/post/3d-detr/ for more details.\n\n### 3D Object Detection\n\n3D bounding boxes and velocities for dynamic objects such as cars.\n\n![](media/det.png)\n\n### Voxel Occupancy\n\nGrids of occupancy around the vehicle trained with differential rendering.\n\n![](media/voxel-highway-cars.png)\n\n### BEV Lane Lines and Drivable Space\n\nLane line and drivable space trained purely from image space labels.\n\n![](media/mesh-semantic.png)\n\n### Semantic Voxel\n\nPer voxel semantic labels for static objects.\n\n![](media/voxel-semantic.png)\n\n## Data Access\n\nThe training dataset for this repo has been collected from my car and thus has\nlots of personally identifying information so I'm not willing to make it public\nat this time. If you're interested in contributing or collaborating feel free to\nreach out. I'm happy to test changes on my own hardware and there may be other\noptions too.\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me either by filing\nan issue or emailing me at [rice@fn.lc](mailto:rice@fn.lc).\n\n## License\n\nThis project is a hobby project and done in my free time.
