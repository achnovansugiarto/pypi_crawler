There are options for backing up the\nmodified file with a custom file extension and for treating a nonexistent file\nas though it's just empty.  There's even an option for determining the line to\ninsert based on capturing groups in the matching regex.\n\n__ https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/\n   lineinfile_module.html\n\nUnlike the Ansible module, this package does not perform any management of file\nattributes; those must be set externally.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n``lineinfile`` requires Python 3.6 or higher.  Just use `pip\n<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install\n``lineinfile`` and its dependencies::\n\n    python3 -m pip install lineinfile\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nA crude ``.ini``-file updater: Set ``theoption`` to ``value``, and if no\nsetting for ``theoption`` is found in the file, add one after the line\n\"``[thesection]``\":\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    $ lineinfile add \\\n        --after-first \"^\\[thesection\\]$\" \\\n        -e \"^theoption\\s*=\" \\\n        \"theoption = thevalue\" \\\n        settings.ini\n\nThe equivalent operation in Python:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from lineinfile import AfterFirst, add_line_to_file\n\n    add_line_to_file(\n        \"settings.ini\",\n        \"theoption = thevalue\",\n        regexp=r\"^theoption\\s*=\",\n        inserter=AfterFirst(r\"^\\[thesection\\]$\"),\n    )\n\nReplace the first instance of \"``foo = ...``\" with \"``foo = 'bar'``\",\npreserving indentation, and create a backup of the file with the extension\n``.bak``, even if no changes were made:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    $ lineinfile add \\\n        -e \"^(\\s*)foo\\s*=\" \\\n        --backrefs \\\n        --match-first \\\n        --backup-always -i.bak \\\n        \"\\1foo = 'bar'\" \\\n        file.py\n\nThe equivalent operation in Python:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from lineinfile import ALWAYS, add_line_to_file\n\n    add_line_to_file(\n        \"file.py\",\n        r\"\\1foo = 'bar'\",\n        regexp=r\"^(\\s*)foo\\s*=\",\n        backrefs=True,\n        match_first=True,\n        backup=ALWAYS,\n        backup_ext=\".bak\",\n    )\n\n\nCommand-Line Usage\n==================\n\nThe ``lineinfile`` command has two subcommands, ``add`` and ``remove``.\n\n``add``\n-------\n\n::\n\n    lineinfile add [<options>] <line> [<file>]\n    lineinfile add [<options>] -L <line> [<file>]\n\nAdd the given ``line`` (after expanding backslash escapes) to the file if it is\nnot already present.  If a `Python regular expression`_ is given with the\n``-e``/``--regexp`` option and it matches any lines in the file, ``line`` will\nreplace the last matching line (or the first matching line, if\n``--match-first`` is given).  If the regular expression does not match any\nlines (or no regular expression is specified) and ``line`` is not found in the\nfile, the line is inserted at the end of the file by default; this can be\nchanged with the ``--after-first``, ``--after-last``, ``--before-first``,\n``--before-last``, and ``--bof`` options.\n\nIf no file name is given on the command line, input is read from standard\ninput, and the result is written to standard output.

Returns ``True`` if the file is modified.  If ``regexp`` is set to a\nregular expression (either a string or a compiled pattern object) and it\nmatches any lines in the file, ``line`` will replace the last matching line (or\nthe first matching line, if ``match_first=True``).  If the regular expression\ndoes not match any lines (or no regular expression is specified) and ``line``\nis not found in the file, the line is inserted at the end of the file by\ndefault; this can be changed by passing the appropriate object as the\n``inserter`` argument; see \"Inserters_\" below.\n\nWhen ``backrefs`` is true, if ``regexp`` matches, the capturing groups in the\nregular expression are used to expand any ``\\n``, ``\\g<n>``, or ``\\g<name>``\nbackreferences in ``line``, and the resulting string replaces the matched line\nin the input.  If ``backrefs`` is true and ``regexp`` does not match, the file\nis left unchanged.  It is an error to set ``backrefs`` to true without also\nsetting ``regexp``.\n\nWhen ``backup`` is set to ``lineinfile.CHANGED``, a backup of the file's\noriginal contents is created if the file is modified.  When ``backup`` is set\nto ``lineinfile.ALWAYS``, a backup is always created, regardless of whether the\nfile is modified.

However, when using ``add_line_to_string()`` or\n``remove_lines_from_string()`` with a string with non-LF line separators,\nthings can get tricky.  ``lineinfile`` follows the following rules regarding\nline separators:\n\n- Lines are terminated by LF, CR, and CR LF only.\n\n- When an ``add_line_*`` function compares a ``line`` argument against a line\n  in the input, the line ending is stripped from both lines.  This is a\n  deviation from Ansible's behavior, where only the input line is stripped.\n\n- When matching an input line against ``regexp`` or an inserter, line endings\n  are not stripped.  Note that a regex like ``r\"foo$\"`` will not match a line\n  that ends with a non-LF line ending, so this can result in patterns not\n  matching where you might naïvely expect them to match.\n\n- When adding a line to the end of a file, if the file does not end with a line\n  ending already, an LF is appended before adding the line.\n\n- When adding ``line`` to a document (either as a new line or replacing a\n  pre-existing line), LF is appended to the line if it does not already end\n  with a line separator; any line ending on the line being replaced (if any) is\n  ignored (If you want to preserve it, use backrefs).  If the only difference\n  between the resulting ``line`` and the line it's replacing is the line\n  ending, the replacement still occurs, the line ending is modified, and the\n  document is changed.\n\n\n",
