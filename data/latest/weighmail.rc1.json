    "description": "=========\nweighmail\n=========\nAn application to label your Gmail messages according to size\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:Author: Brian Neal <bgneal@gmail.com>\n:Version: 0.1.0\n:Date: May 20, 2012\n:Home Page: https://bitbucket.org/bgneal/weighmail/\n:License: New BSD License (see LICENSE.txt)\n:Support: https://bitbucket.org/bgneal/weighmail/issues\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n``weighmail`` is a program that analyzes your Gmail and applies labels to your\nmessages according to their size. This is useful if you are close to reaching\nyour quota as it allows you to quickly identify large messages. You have\ncomplete control over the rules used to create the labels.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``weighmail`` can be installed using Pip_::\n\n   $ pip install weighmail\n\nAlternatively you can download a tarball and install with::\n\n   $ python setup.py install\n\n``weighmail`` depends on the IMAPClient_ library. This library is automatically\ninstalled if you use Pip_.\n\nGmail Notes\n-----------\n\nIn case it isn't clear, ``weighmail`` works with Gmail_. You must have a Gmail\naccount with `IMAP support turned on`_. Please go into your settings and verify\nIMAP support is turned on before proceeding.\n\nIf you are using `two-step verification`_ on your Gmail account (**and you\nreally should be**), you `need to generate an application specific password`_\nfor ``weighmail`` to use. In this case you will use an application specific\npassword instead of your normal password when running ``weighmail``.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n``weighmail`` can accept options from a configuration file and/or the\ncommand-line. Command-line arguments always take precedence over options found\nin the configuration file.\n\nCommand-Line Arguments\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``weighmail`` takes a fair number of arguments on the command-line. Most of\nthese can be omitted however, as they all have sensible defaults. In fact, the\nsimplest way to run ``weighmail`` is as follows::\n\n   $ weighmail --labels big:1MB-5MB huge:5MB-10MB enormous:10MB-\n\nThis example demonstrates:\n\n* A *big* label will be applied to messages between 1 and 5 Megabytes\n* A *huge* label will be applied to messages between 5 and 10 Megabytes\n* An *enormous* label will be applied to messages 10 MB and bigger\n* Since no ``user`` or ``password`` options were supplied on the command-line,\n  ``weighmail`` will interactively prompt for them. Neither will be echoed out\n  for privacy reasons.\n\nTo see a list of all command-line options::\n\n   $ weighmail --help\n\nSome notes on the options follows.\n\n* The ``--config`` option is used to specify a configuration file that\n  ``weighmail`` will read for options. Any options supplied on the command-line\n  will override any options from this file. In particular, if you specify any\n  label rules on the command-line, all label rules in the configuration file\n  will be ignored.\n* The ``--folder`` option can be used to specify which Gmail label to search for\n  messages. This defaults to your *All Mail* label.\n* The ``--user`` and ``--password`` options are used to specify which Gmail\n  account to log into. If these are not supplied, and also omitted from a config\n  file (or if no config file is being used), ``weighmail`` will prompt you for\n  these options.\n* The ``--labels`` argument is how you specify the rules for labeling your\n  messages. See the sub-section below for more detail on this syntax.\n* The ``--host``, ``--port``, and ``--nossl`` arguments are for advanced use\n  only, and may in fact not work. The defaults should work for most people, and\n  will connect you to ``imap.gmail.com`` port 993 using SSL.\n\nThe --labels argument syntax\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTo specify label rules on the command-line, use the following syntax::\n\n   $ weighmail --labels name:min-max [name:min-max] ...\n\nWhere:\n\n* *name* is the name of the label. Note that Gmail labels cannot have spaces in\n  them.\n* *min* and *max* specify the message size range in bytes. Either one, but not\n  both, may be omitted (but the dash must remain). You may use the suffixes\n  ``KB``, ``MB``, or ``GB`` to indicate kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes,\n  respectively.\n\nAnother example::\n\n   $ weighmail --labels normal:-2MB big:2MB-7MB huge:7MB-\n \nIn all these examples the label ranges do not overlap. This does not have to be\nthe case; overlapping ranges may be defined if desired.\n\n\nConfiguration File\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you specify the ``--config=filename`` option on the command-line,\n``weighmail`` will parse this file for options. Please see the included\n`sample-weighmail.ini` file for the syntax and option descriptions.\n\nAgain, note that command-line arguments take precedence over options found in\nthe configuration file. If you specify *any* label rules on the command-line,\n*all* label rules in the configuration file are ignored.\n\n\nThanks\n~~~~~~\n\nA big thank-you to Menno Smits, the author of the IMAPClient_ library. This\napplication would have been considerably more complicated if the awesome\nIMAPClient library did not exist.\n\n\n.. _Pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n.. _Gmail: http://mail.google.com/\n.. _IMAP support turned on: http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=77695\n.. _two-step verification: http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=180744\n.. _need to generate an application specific password: http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=185833&topic=1056283&ctx=topic\n.. _IMAPClient: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/IMAPClient/",
