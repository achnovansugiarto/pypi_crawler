    "description": "# Example PyPI (Python Package Index) Package & Tutorial / Instruction / Workflow for 2021\n\nThis is an example [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (Python Package Index) package set up with automated tests and package publishing using GitHub Actions CI/CD. It is made primarily for GitHub + VS Code (Windows / Mac / Linux) users who are about to write and publish their first PyPI package. The package could serve as a starter / boilerplate and the tutorial could give you a quick and concise explaination to solve some small but annoying problems you might encounter, such as package / module name confusion, and VS Code test configuration issues.\n\n<details><summary><strong>Differences from pypa/sampleproject (click to show/hide)</strong></summary>\n\nThis example package is inspired by / based on the [official sample project pypa/sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject), but this package:\n\n- is a simplified version of pypa/sampleproject (and the [official Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/))\n- uses GitHub Actions for both testing and publishing, instead of Travis CI\n- is tested when pushing `master` or `main` branch, and is published when create a release\n- includes test files in the source distribution\n- uses **setup.cfg** for [version single-sourcing](https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/) (setuptools 46.4.0+)\n- has **.vscode\\settings.json** and **vscode.env** which adds **src/** folder to `PYTHONPATH`, so that test files don't have linting errors and may run with pytest in VS Code\n- does not use flake8 for automated linting - it is sometimes too strict and inflexible, you may use pylint locally instead\n- has this tutorial that covers everything you need to know in one page. Everything that might not be very useful, is hidden in collapsible sections that you can click to show\n- has **[.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download)** file\n\n</details>\n\n## Make necessary changes\n\nFork, clone or download the repository [github.com/tomchen/example_pypi_package](https://github.com/tomchen/example_pypi_package).\n\n### Package, module name\n\nMany use a same package and module name, you could definitely do that. But this example package and its module's names are different: `example_pypi_package` and `examplepy`.\n\nOpen `example_pypi_package` folder with Visual Studio Code, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows / Linux) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS) to find all occurrences of both names and replace them with your package and module's names. Also remember to change the name of the folder **src/examplepy**.\n\nSimply and very roughly speaking, package name is used in `pip install <PACKAGENAME>` and module name is used in `import <MODULENAME>`. Both names should consist of lowercase basic letters (a-z). They may have underscores (`_`) if you really need them. Hyphen-minus (`-`) should not be used.\n\nYou'll also need to make sure the URL \"https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/\" (replace `example-pypi-package` by your package name, with all `_` becoming `-`) is not occupied.\n\n<details><summary><strong>Details on naming convention (click to show/hide)</strong></summary>\n\nUnderscores (`_`) can be used but such use is discouraged. Numbers can be used if the name does not start with a number, but such use is also discouraged.\n\nName starting with a number and/or containing hyphen-minus (`-`) should not be used: although technically legal, such name causes a lot of trouble − users have to use `importlib` to import it.\n\nDon't be fooled by the URL \"[pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/](https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/)\" and the name \"example-pypi-package\" on pypi.org. pypi.org and pip system convert all `_` to `-` and use the latter on the website / in `pip` command, but the real name is still with `_`, which users should use when importing the package.\n\nThere's also [namespace](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) to use if you need sub-packages.\n\n</details>\n\n### Other changes\n\nMake necessary changes in **setup.py**.\n\nThe package's version number `__version__` is in **src/examplepy/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py**. You may want to change that.\n\nThe example package is designed to be compatible with Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and will be tested against these versions. If you need to change the version range, you should change:\n\n- `classifiers`, `python_requires` in **setup.py**\n- `envlist` in **tox.ini**\n- `matrix: python:` in **.github/workflows/test.yml**\n\nIf you plan to upload to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) which is a playground of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for testing purpose, change `twine upload --repository pypi dist/*` to `twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*` in the file **.github/workflows/release.yml**.\n\n## Development\n\n### pip\n\npip is a Python package manager. You already have pip if you use Python 3.4 and later version which include it by default. Read [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip) to know how to check whether pip is installed. Read [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py) if you need to install it.\n\n### Use VS Code\n\nVisual Studio Code is the most popular code editor today, our example package is configured to work with VS Code.\n\nInstall VS Code extension \"[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)\".\n\n\"Python\" VS Code extension will suggest you install pylint. Also, the example package is configured to use pytest with VS Code + Python extensions, so, install pylint and pytest:\n\n```bash\npip install pylint pytest\n```\n\n(It's likely you will be prompted to install them, if that's the case, you don't need to type and execute the command)\n\n**vscode.env**'s content is now `PYTHONPATH=/;src/;${PYTHONPATH}` which is good for Windows. If you use Linux or MacOS, you need to change it to `PYTHONPATH=/:src/:${PYTHONPATH}` (replacing `;` with `:`). If the PATH is not properly set, you'll see linting errors in test files and pytest won't be able to run **tests/test\\_\\*.py** files correctly.\n\nClose and reopen VS Code. You can now click the lab flask icon in the left menu and run all tests there, with pytest. pytest seems better than the standard unittest framework, it supports `unittest` thus you can keep using `import unittest` in your test files.\n\nThe example package also has a **.editorconfig** file. You may install VS Code extension \"[EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)\" that uses the file. With current configuration, the EditorConfig tool can automatically use spaces (4 spaces for .py, 2 for others) for indentation, set `UTF-8` encoding, `LF` end of lines, trim trailing whitespaces in non Markdown files, etc.\n\nIn VS Code, you can go to File -> Preferences -> Settings, type \"Python Formatting Provider\" in the search box, and choose one of the three Python code formatting tools (autopep8, black and yapf), you'll be prompted to install it. The shortcuts for formatting of a code file are <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows); <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Option (Alt)</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS); <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Linux).\n\n### Write your package\n\nIn **src/examplepy/** (`examplepy` should have been replaced by your module name) folder, rename **module1.py** and write your code in it. Add more module .py files if you need to.\n\n### Write your tests\n\nIn **tests/** folder, rename **test_module1.py** (to **test\\_\\*.py**) and write your unit test code (with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)) in it. Add more **test\\_\\*.py** files if you need to.\n\n<details><summary><strong>The testing tool `tox` will be used in the automation with GitHub Actions CI/CD. If you want to use `tox` locally, click to read the \"Use tox locally\" section</strong></summary>\n\n### Use tox locally\n\nInstall tox and run it:\n\n```bash\npip install tox\ntox\n```\n\nIn our configuration, tox runs a check of source distribution using [check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/) (which requires your repo to be git-initialized (`git init`) and added (`git add .`) at least), setuptools's check, and unit tests using pytest. You don't need to install check-manifest and pytest though, tox will install them in a separate environment.\n\nThe automated tests are run against several Python versions, but on your machine, you might be using only one version of Python, if that is Python 3.9, then run:\n\n```bash\ntox -e py39\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIf you add more files to the root directory (**example_pypi_package/**), you'll need to add your file to `check-manifest --ignore` list in **tox.ini**.\n\n<details><summary><strong>Thanks to GitHub Actions' automated process, you don't need to generate distribution files locally. But if you insist, click to read the \"Generate distribution files\" section</strong></summary>\n\n## Generate distribution files\n\n### Install tools\n\nInstall or upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel`:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel\n```\n\n(If `python3` is the command on your machine, change `python` to `python3` in the above command, or add a line `alias python=python3` to **~/.bashrc** or **~/.bash_aliases** file if you use bash on Linux)\n\n### Generate `dist`\n\nFrom `example_pypi_package` directory, run the following command, in order to generate production version for source distribution (sdist) in `dist` folder:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\n### Install locally\n\nOptionally, you can install dist version of your package locally before uploading to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/):\n\n```bash\npip install dist/example_pypi_package-0.1.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n(You may need to uninstall existing package first:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall example_pypi_package\n```\n\nThere may be several installed packages with the same name, so run `pip uninstall` multiple times until it says no more package to remove.)\n\n</details>\n\n## Upload to PyPI\n\n### Register on PyPI and get token\n\nRegister an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), go to [Account settings § API tokens](https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens), \"Add API token\". The PyPI token only appears once, copy it somewhere. If you missed it, delete the old and add a new token.\n\n(Register a [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) account if you are uploading to TestPyPI)\n\n### Set secret in GitHub repo\n\nOn the page of your newly created or existing GitHub repo, click **Settings** -> **Secrets** -> **New repository secret**, the **Name** should be `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and the **Value** should be your PyPI token (which starts with `pypi-`).\n\n### Push or release\n\nThe example package has automated tests and upload (publishing) already set up with GitHub Actions:\n\n- Every time you `git push` your `master` or `main` branch, the package is automatically tested against the desired Python versions with GitHub Actions.\n- Every time a new release (either the initial version or an updated version) is created, the package is automatically uploaded to PyPI with GitHub Actions.\n\n### View it on pypi.org\n\nAfter your package is published on PyPI, go to [https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/](https://pypi.org/project/example-pypi-package/) (`_` becomes `-`). Copy the command on the page, execute it to download and install your package from PyPI. (or test.pypi.org if you use that)\n\n<details><summary><strong>If you publish the package to PyPI manually, click to read</strong></summary>\n\n### Install Twine\n\nInstall or upgrade Twine:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install --user --upgrade twine\n```\n\nCreate a **.pypirc** file in your **$HOME** (**~**) directory, its content should be:\n\n```ini\n[pypi]\nusername = __token__\npassword = <PyPI token>\n```\n\n(Use `[testpypi]` instead of `[pypi]` if you are uploading to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/))\n\nReplace `<PyPI token>` with your real PyPI token (which starts with `pypi-`).\n\n(if you don't manually create **$HOME/.pypirc**, you will be prompted for a username (which should be `__token__`) and password (which should be your PyPI token) when you run Twine)\n\n### Upload\n\nRun Twine to upload all of the archives under **dist** folder:\n\n```bash\npython -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*\n```\n\n(use `testpypi` instead of `pypi` if you are uploading to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/))\n\n### Update\n\nWhen you finished developing a newer version of your package, do the following things.\n\nModify the version number `__version__` in **src\\examplepy\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py**.\n\nDelete all old versions in **dist**.\n\nRun the following command again to regenerate **dist**:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nRun the following command again to upload **dist**:\n\n```bash\npython -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*\n```\n\n(use `testpypi` instead of `pypi` if needed)\n\n</details>\n\n## References\n\n- [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)'s sample project](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject)\n- [PyPA's Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)\n- [Stackoverflow questions and answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41093648/how-to-test-that-pypi-install-will-work-before-pushing-to-pypi-python)\n- [GitHub Actions Guides: Building and testing Python](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python)",
