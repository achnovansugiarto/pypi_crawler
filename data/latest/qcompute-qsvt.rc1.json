All Rights Reserved.*\n\n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-green)](./LICENSE) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green)]() ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v0.1.1-red)\n\n## About QSVT Toolkit\n\n**QSVT** toolkit is a **Q**uantum **S**ingular **V**alue **T**ransformation toolkit based on [QCompute](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/opensource) and developed by the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com). It aims to implement quantum simulation and other algorithms on quantum devices or simulators more conveniently. Currently, it includes three main modules:\n\n+ **Quantum Singular Value Transformation** (QSVT) is used for implementing singular value transformations of quantum operations, whose input and output are both block-encodings of quantum operations. \n\n+ **Symmetric Quantum Signal Processing** (SQSP) is used for encoding such transformation functions and completing such quantum circuits in QSVT. SQSP is introduced for implementing the encoding step more effectively.\n\n+ **Hamiltonian Simulation** is one of the most significant applications for QSVT, and even quantum computing. It provides functions to generate quantum circuits for time evolution operators of Hamiltonians.\n\nQSVT toolkit is based on [QCompute](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/opensource), a Python-based open-source quantum computing platform SDK also developed by [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com). It provides a full-stack programming experience for senior users via hybrid quantum programming language features and high-performance simulators. You can install QCompute via [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/qcompute/). When you install QSVT toolkit, the dependency QCompute will be automatically installed. Please refer to QCompute's official [Open Source](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/opensource) page for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Create Python Environment\n\nWe recommend using Anaconda as the development environment management tool for Python3. Anaconda supports multiple mainstream operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux). It provides Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, and many other scientific computing and drawing packages. Conda, a virtual environment manager, can be used to install and update the latest Python packages. Here we give simple instructions on how to use conda to create and manage virtual environments.\n\n1. First, open the command line (Terminal) interface: Windows users can enter ``Anaconda Prompt``; macOS users can use the key combination ``command + space`` and then enter ``Terminal``.\n\n2. After opening the Terminal window, enter\n\n    ```bash\n    conda create --name qsvt_env python=3.9\n    ```\n\n    to create a Python 3.9 environment named ``qsvt_env``. With the following command, we can activate the virtual environment created,\n\n    ```bash\n    conda activate qsvt_env\n    ```\n\nFor more detailed instructions on conda, please refer to the [Official Tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).\n\n### Install QSVT Toolkit\n\nQSVT toolkit is compatible with 64-bit Python 3.9, on Linux, macOS (10.14 or later) and Windows. We recommend installing it with ``pip``. After Activating the conda environment, then enter\n\n```bash\npip install qcompute-qsvt\n```\n\nThis will install the QSVT toolkit binaries as well as the QSVT toolkit package. \n\nFor those using an older version of QSVT toolkit, update by installing with the `--upgrade` flag. The new version includes additional features and bug fixes.\n\n### Run Examples\n\nNow, you can try to write a simple program to check whether QSVT toolkit has been successfully installed. For example, run the following program,\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom QCompute import *\nfrom qcompute_qsvt.Application.HamiltonianSimulation import func_HS_QSVT\n\nfunc_HS_QSVT(list_str_Pauli_rep=[(1, 'X0X1'), (1, 'X0Z1'), (1, 'Z0X1'), (1, 'Z0Z1')],\n             num_qubit_sys=2, float_tau=-np.pi / 8, float_epsilon=1e-6, circ_output=False)\n```\n\nwe will operate a time evolution operator on initial state $|00\\rangle$ for Hamiltonian $X\\otimes X + X\\otimes Z + Z\\otimes X + Z\\otimes Z$ and time $-\\pi/8$ with precision `1e-6`, and then measure such final state.\n\nNote that more examples are provided in the [source codes](https://github.com/baidu/QCompute/tree/master/Extensions/QuantumSingularValueTransformation), [tutorials](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/docs/qsvt) and [API documentation](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/docs/qsvt/). You can get started from there.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nQSVT toolkit provides [quick start](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-quickstart) for using the Hamiltonian Simulation module, as well as a [brief introduction](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-introduction) to the theories for users to learn and get started. The current content of the following tutorial is organized as follows, and it is recommended that beginners read and study in order:\n\n- [Brief Introduction](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-introduction)\n- [Quantum Signal Processing](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-qsp)\n- [Block-Encoding and Linear Combination of Unitary Operations](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-be)\n- [Quantum Eigenvalue and Singular Value Transformation](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-qet)\n- [Hamiltonian Simulation](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qsvt/tutorial-hs)\n\nWe will supply more detailed and comprehensive tutorials in the future. \n\n## API Documentation\n\nFor those who are looking for explanation on the python classes and functions in QSVT toolkit, please refer to our [API documentation](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/docs/qsvt/).\n\n## Feedbacks\n\nUsers are encouraged to contact us via email quantum@baidu.com with general questions, unfixed bugs, and potential improvements. We hope to make QSVT toolkit better together with the community!\n\n## Research based on QSVT Toolkit\n\nWe encourage researchers and developers to use QSVT toolkit to explore quantum algorithms.
