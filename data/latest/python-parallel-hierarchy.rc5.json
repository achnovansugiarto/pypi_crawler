This factory takes as input a class from an original model, and outputs\na new class in a new parallel inheritance structure.\n\nMore information at https://gitlab.com/joel.larose/python-parallel-hierarchy/-/blob/master/README.rst\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n.. code::\n\n    pip install https://gitlab.com/joel.larose/python-parallel-hierarchy.git\n\nor\n\n.. code::\n\n    pip install python-parallel-hierarchy\n\n",
