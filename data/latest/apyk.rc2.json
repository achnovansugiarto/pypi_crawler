    "description": "## APyK - APK Backup\n\nAPyK is a program with which you will be able to backup your applications from your computer, **FREE** and better yet **WITHOUT BEING ROOT**. Without further ado, let's get started.\n\n## üíª - Pre-requisites\n\nHave basic knowledge of **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**, you will need to install it, add it to the environment variables and authorize your computer to access the device.\n\nAPyK was tested and programmed with **ADB version 1.0.32 Revision eac51f2bb6a8-android**.\n\n\n\n## üêç - Installation from Python\n\nYou can use **APyK** from Python.\n\n```bash\npip install APyK\n```\n\nAfter install type **apyk** and press **Enter**\n\n<p align=\"center\"><b>OR</b></p>\n\n## ‚¨áÔ∏è - Download executable\n\nDownload the latest version of **APyK** for **Windows** from [**HERE**](https://github.com/Jalkhov/apyk/releases/latest). After downloading extract and run the **apyk.exe** file located in the extracted folder. You will see many command line windows opening and closing in some processes, we will see if we can suppress them in future versions.\n\n## üìò - Usage\n\n<details>\n  <summary>üîΩ <span style=\"color:red\"><b>Click here to expand tutorial!</b></span> üîΩ</summary>\n\n##### üëÄ Remember\n\n* Have ADB added to the system environment variables.\n* Have granted permissions to the computer to access the device.\n* Have the device in debug mode.\n* And (of course), have the device connected to the computer via USB.\n\n##### üîé App name lookup\n\n![1.Name_Lookup](https://i.imgur.com/E15SW4e.png)\n\nThis warning is due to the fact that when listing the applications installed on your device they will look approximately as follows:\n\n```text\norg.telegram.messenger\ncom.whatsapp\ncom.facebook.lite\n```\n\nEach app in the playstore has a **unique ID**, and these are the ones that will be displayed in the list of apps, as you can see there are some that can be easily identified, however there are others whose IDs have nothing to do with the original name and for some people it is difficult to know which app corresponds, such as **Tik Tok**:\n\n```text\ncom.zhiliaoapp.musically\n```\n\nAnyway, returning to the main point, if we decide to activate the option in question, APyK will look for the real name of the app based on the ID of this, and it will go from looking like we showed it before to look like this:\n\n```text\norg.telegram.messenger | Telegram\ncom.whatsapp | WhatsApp Messenger\ncom.facebook.lite | Facebook Lite\ncom.zhiliaoapp.musically | Tik Tok\n```\n\nPlease note that this option requires an internet connection, and depending on the speed of the internet connection the list of applications will be loaded.\n\n**NOTE**: As it says in the warning, apps that do not belong to the Play Store will not be affected, since as I mentioned before, the search is done based on the ID with which the app is registered.\n\nAt once I say that this option is courtesy of the library [**google-play-scraper**](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper), credits to its creator.\n\n##### üñ•Ô∏è Main Screen\n\nOnce you have made a decision regarding the above option, if you have the above **[HERE](#-remember)**, the program will automatically start searching for the installed applications, and if everything went well, it will display the respective list.\n\n![2.Main_Screen](https://i.imgur.com/vkgHYCo.png)\n\nOn the main screen we have (for now):\n\n* ID of the detected device\n* Field to filter the listed applications\n* List of applications\n* And some very obvious buttons\n\nA very intuitive interface, isn't it? Simple just select with a click the applications you want to back up, you can also use the filter bar to find more quickly those applications of which you have a notion of the name that has its package ID. Like the example you will see below:\n\n![3.Filter](https://i.imgur.com/BqZ9v16.png)\n\nWhen you select the applications the interface will change, and a new list will appear with the applications you have selected and the button to proceed with the backup.\n\n![4.Selected_Packages](https://i.imgur.com/l4Y8W0y.png)\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your selection, press the **Backup** button. You will instantly be prompted to browse and select the destination directory for the apks to be backed up. Note that if you cancel the directory selection, the backup process will also be cancelled. Once you have selected the destination directory the backup process will start, and at the end you will see the following screen:\n\n![6.Results](https://i.imgur.com/8m1hNFg.png)\n\n(For now) the resulting file names will be the package IDs of each application, so our final directory would look like this:\n\n![7.Folder.PNG](https://i.imgur.com/Jla0xbD.png)\n\n</details>\n\n## üí°- TODO\n\n* Restore or install APKs\n* Save each backed up apk with its application name (if available)\n* Support for other operating systems (Do you want to contribute?)\n\n\n\n## üí™ - Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\n\n\n## üìù - License\n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\n\n",
