    "description": "Protocol based timeout facility for urllib2.\n        \n        Currently only support HTTP and HTTPS.\n        \n        Achived by inheriting httplib.HTTPConnection and httplib.HTTPSConnection\n        classes and provide a timeout version for both. Timeout has been carefully\n        implemented per connection base. A HTTPConnectionTimeoutError or\n        HTTPSConnectionTimeoutError would be raised instead of the general socket.error\n        so that urlib2 wouldn't throw out URLError exception when timeout is hit.",
