    "description": "Symbolicator\nby Peter Hosey\n\nThis is a program to symbolicate crash logs generated on Mac OS X.\n\nWhen you receive a crash log, pipe it through the Symbolicator. You'll probably want to send the output into a pager or editor.\n\n\tsymbolicator < MyApp-2009-01-01-130145_My-Computer.crash | less \n\nThe Symbolicator will use Spotlight to find any dSYM bundles it needs, and dwarfdump to extract symbol information for the addresses in the crash log; it will then replace the bare addresses in the log text with the matching symbol information, and write the symbolicated text out to its standard output.\n\nThis means:\n\n- You do not need to tell the Symbolicator where your dSYM bundles are, nor to put your dSYM bundles into a special location. As long as Spotlight can find them, the Symbolicator will find them automatically.\n- You can use ThisService (http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/) to make a Symbolicator service. With this, you can select the entire text of a crash log, use your preferred graphical editor's New Window with Selection service to copy that text to a new document, and then select the crash log text there and run your Symbolicator service on it.",
