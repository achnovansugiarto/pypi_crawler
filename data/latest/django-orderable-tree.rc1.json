Optimised for fast insertion/moving of nodes around the tree.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Django 3.2+\n* Python 3.8+\n\n\n## Installation\n\n* Add `django_tree` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply extend the `BaseTreeNode` class in your application: e.g.\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nfrom django_tree.models import BaseTreeNode\n\n\nclass Category(BaseTreeNode):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n\n# Will contain an OrderedDict of categories organised into a tree structure.\ncategories = Category.objects.build_tree()\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Install dev dependencies: `poetry install`.\n2. Install a supported version of Django: `pip install django==3.2`\n3. Run the tests: `DB_NAME=\"django_tree\" python -m pytest tests .`\n",
