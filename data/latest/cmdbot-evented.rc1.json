    "description": "=================================\nCmdBot, a bot with `cmd` attitude\n=================================\n\n\nIntroducing CmdBot\n==================\n\nCmdBot is an IRC Bot written in Python. It consists of a core module that\ndefines a `Bot` class you can extend to fit your needs. It comes with a\n`Brain`, that is to say a simple instance of ``object`` that can contain\nany data you want. That's like a *memory* that lives as long as the Bot is\nworking.\n\nIt's far from being 100% perfect, but I think it takes the best of Python's\nintrospection mechanism.\n\nBy the way, why the name \"CmdBot\"? Because its function loading system has been\ninspired by the `Python's cmd module <http://docs.python.org/library/cmd.html>`_,\nthat uses class member introspection to catch the designated functions and\nexecute them.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis piece of software is published under the terms of the WTFPL  (Do What\nThe Fuck You Want License), that can be summed as its term \"0\":\n\n     0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.\n\nFor more information, go to : <http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/>\n\nThe extensive documentation\n===========================\n\nAn extensive documentation can be found at <http://readthedocs.org/docs/cmdbot/>\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nCmdBot is hosted on Github. If you want the latest code, go fetch it here:\n\nhttps://github.com/kyleterry/cmdbot-evented\n\nYou can install the program using::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nA cute \"ini\" file\n-----------------\n\nThe mandatory step: building an ini file. You can use the sample bot.ini file\nthat sits in the source code, or edit your own. You just have to know that only\ntwo variables **must** be set in it::\n\n    [general]\n    host = name.your.server\n    chan = #nameyourchan\n\nThe other vars are optional, and usually default values would suit.\n\nThe \"admin\" value\n#################\n\nIf you want some admin to take this bot over (and you surely need it at some point),\nset the value with a space-separated list of nicks... e.g.::\n\n    admins = nick1 nick2 nick3\n\nYou may use the \"@admin\" decorator in your extended classes to process the bot\nline **only** if the user that has send the order is in this nick list.\n\n\nWant to run the bot?\n--------------------\n\nIt's as simple as::\n\n    python cmdbot/core.py bot.ini\n\nBut... your bot won't be able to do much. Here is a sample \"dialog\"::\n\n    22:31 -!- cmdbot [~cmdbot@127.0.0.1] has joined #cdc\n    22:31 < cmdbot> Hi everyone.\n    22:31 < No`> cmdbot: help\n    22:31 < cmdbot> No`: you need some help? Here is some...\n    22:31 < cmdbot> Available commands: help, ping\n    22:32 < No`> cmdbot: ping\n    22:32 < cmdbot> No`: pong\n    22:32 -!- cmdbot [~cmdbot@127.0.0.1] has quit [EOF From client]\n\nWant a more clever bot?\n=======================\n\nHere's how:\n\n* Create a module / script with a bot that extends the core bot\n* add it a few \"do_[stuff]\" commands\n* make it more clever, by using its \"brain\"\n\nYou can see a few example of what a \"brainy bot\" can do in the `samples`\ndirectory.\n\nWhat's next?\n============\n\nWell... now, the sky is the limit. Extended bots can manipulate data, remember\nit, treat and process it... And you can still use this bot as a \"dumb\", if you\nwant!",
