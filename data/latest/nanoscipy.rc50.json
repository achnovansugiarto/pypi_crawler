    "description": "# nanoscipy\n\nnanoscipy has been made, to ease the data-handling, -processing, and - analysis. Additionally, it also provides a \nsimple way to perform numerical calculations with units.\nThis package is being readily updated at the moment, so be sure to keep up, as new and useful additions and fixes are \nvery likely to be included.\n\n## Installation and updating\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install nanoscipy like below. \nRerun this command to check for and install  updates .\n```bash\npip install nanoscipy\n```\nFor package updates, use:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade nanoscipy\n```\nNote that if you're using anaconda, you might have to install the module from the anaconda terminal instead (or use \nconda rather than pip)\n\n## Import\n<details><summary>Click for details</summary>\n<p>\nCurrently, the package consists of four distinct modules:\n```bash\nnanoscipy.functions\n```\nContains most of the practical functions of nanoscipy. \n\n```bash\nnanoscipy.modules\n```\nContains all classes of nanoscipy.\n\n```bash\nnanoscipy.util\n```\nContains all utility functions and lists used within nanoscipy. Different modules use functions from this module. \nNote that some of these functions may be of practical use, but many are simply throw-away functions to increase \nreadability.\n\n```bash\nnanoscipy.mathpar\n```\nThe module with the mathematical parser of nanoscipy. Specifically, this contains the practical function parser(), which\nis the collective parser itself.\n\n```bash\nnanoscipy.unitpar\n```\nContains a script that allows for computation with units. \n</p>\n</details>\n\n## Getting started with unit computations\n<details><summary>Click for details</summary>\n<p>\nThere are two main functions of concern here; `mathpar.parser()` and `unitpar.unit_parser()`, but the focus will be on \nthe module `modules.NumAn` as this is what is meant to be the 'calculator'. This section will serve as an explanation of how \nit works and how it may be used for different purposes.\n(Last updated: v3.0.8)\n\n### 1) The NumAn object\nWhen defining the NumAn object there are a few things to note. The `__init__()` function takes five different inputs, \nall of which are optional. The first is `cons` which is where initial constants can be defined so that they may be used \nin computations later on (by default no constants are defined), e.g.:\n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ncal1 = nsm.NumAn('A=234 kg, lambda=53 nm')\n```\nWill have the constants `A` and `lambda` defined with the values `234 kg` and `53 nm` assigned to them, respectively.\nConstants may also be defined via the attribute function `.add_cns()`, which works in much the same way, so that for\n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ncal2 = nsm.NumAn()\ncal2.add_cns('A=234 kg, lambda=53 nm')\n```\nthe same constants are defined as for the `cal1` object. \nThe add-constant attribute does, however, work slightly different, allowing for new constants to be defined with \npreviously defined constants, so\n```python\ncal2.add_cns('A2=4*A')\n```\nwould make it so that `A2=936 kg`. \nConstants may effectively have any desired name with a few exceptions: The constant must be a string, meaning that it \ncannot be converted to a float or int, so `B2=34` is allowed, but `22=34` is not. Be aware that constant-values are \nsubstituted before calculations are done, which means that if a constant `2H=4` is defined, and a calculation is done \nfor a string `'32H'` the result is `'3*2H=3*4=12'`.\n\nThe second parameter is `unit_identifier`. This defines an identifier for which units can be told apart from defined \nconstants by the different scripts. This can in principle be set to any symbol, but be smart about it. The default\nvalue used for this purpose is `' '`, which is illustrated in the examples above. Another example is seen below for \n`unit_identifier='~'`\n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ncal3 = nsm.NumAn(unit_identifier='~')\ncal3.add_cns('A=234~kg, lambda=53~nm')\ncal3.add_cns('A2=4*A')\n```\n\nThe third parameter is `units`. This tells the script whether units should be used or not (explicitly). Effectively, \nthis only affects natural constants used (see [More about constants](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy#2-more-about-constants)). \nTherefore, the default setting is `units=True` meaning that the script will act as computations should be done with units. \nSetting this to `False` will have the script do calculations without units (effectively). It must although be emphasized that this __only__ affects natural constants\nand so everything is still fine if no units are used initially, as long as no natural constants are used, unless it is \nby division or multiplication, in which case it is also fine.\n\nThe next parameter is `cprint`. This affects how the result from a computation is displayed (the console print), and affects all \ncomputations if not anything else is set specifically per computation (see [Calculations](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy#3-calculations)). \nThere are a few options here, but the main difference is between `'num'` and `'sym'`. If set to `'num'` the result will \nbe displayed as the `mathpar.parser()` reads the expression, i.e. with only numbers and mathematical symbols. If set to `'sym'` the \nexpression will be displayed with symbols/constants rather than numbers. A variance is `'symc'`, which displays the\nconstants used in the expression, along with the result. Subtypes are `'sym_ex'` and `'symc_ex'`, which will display\nthe main expression with explicit multiplication (if any implicit multiplication was used). If set to `None` or `False` \nno console print is done. Examples can be found in \n[Calculations](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy#3-calculations). The default setting is `'symc_ex'`.\n\nThe last parameter is `sf` which sets the significant figures for the console print. It is important to note that it \ndoes not change the significant figures of the calculation itself nor the result. It __only__ changes the console print.\nThis parameter takes integer values, and can be set to `None` if no evaluation is desired. The default value is 4. Note \nthat this feature works by using the `mpmath.workdps` function.\n\n### 2) More about constants\nThere has already been presented examples of how constants may be defined, but there are a few additional features to \nnote. A list of all the currently defined constants can be seen by calling the attribute function `.constants()`. Note\nthat if constants are defined with units, then they are _displayed_ with `' '` as the unit identifier, regardless of the \nvalue of `unit_identifier` in the `__init__()` call. When adding constants that have already been defined, the new \nconstant value will overwrite the old, and a prompt will be printed in the console. E.g.: \n```python\ncal1 = nsm.NumAn('A=234 kg, lambda=53 nm')\ncal1.add_cns('A=34 g')\n```\n```\n>>> Constant 'A = 234 kg' has been changed to '34 g'.\n```\nConstants may also be removed with the attribute function `.del_cns()`. Simply specify which constants should be removed \nin the call. E.g. from the example above: \n```python\ncal1.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n>>> | lambda = 53 nm\n>>> | A = 34 g\n```\n```python\ncal1.del_cns('A, lambda')\ncal1.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n```\n\nNote here that `.del_cns()` can also be used with multiple arguments, rather than with a single string, e.g.: \n```python\ncal1.del_cns('A', 'lambda')\ncal1.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n```\n\nConstants may also be defined from latest computed result by calling the attribute function `.add_res()` with the name \nof the constant, e.g. `.add_res('omega')` will add the latest result from computation as the constant `'omega'`.\n\nOther than the constants that can be defined by the user, there are some pre-defined natural constants, which may be \nused in all calculations, in which they might be needed. These are constants such as the Boltzmann constant `_k`, the \nPlanck constant `_h` or the speed of light in a vacuum `_c`. Note that all constants are denoted with an underscore.\nA full list of the supported units can be seen by calling the attribute `.supported_physical_constants`. \nDepending on whether `units` is set to `True` or `False`, these natural constants will either have associated units or will \nsimply be the natural constant value with SI units:\n\n```python\ntest = nsm.NumAn(units=False)\nprint(test.supported_physical_constants)\n```\n```\n>>> ('_hbar=1.0545718176461565e-34', ..., '_mp=1.67262192369e-27')\n```\n```python\ntest = nsm.NumAn(units=True)\nprint(test.supported_physical_constants)\n```\n```\n>>> ('_hbar=(1.0545718176461565e-34 J Hz^-1)', ..., '_mp=(1.67262192369e-27 kg)')\n```\n### 3) Calculations\nCalculations are performed via the `.calc()` attribute function. This effectively utilizes `unitpar.unit_parser()`, \nwhich utilizes `mathpar.parser()` to compute the numerical part of the expression. An example of basic usage is seen \nbelow: \n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ncal = nsm.NumAn()\ncal.calc('3*5+2^2')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 3·5+2^2 = 19\n19\n```\n\nThere are a few things to note here. As seen, the support for mathematical operators is slightly different compared to \nnormal python. Specifically, there is support for the operations; `+, -, *, /, ^, !` (currently, there is no support \nfor the usual way of denoting a power as `**`). There is also a 'prettifier' built-in, which automatically changes \nconstants and specific operations to be more in line with how it would look, when simply writing it out on a piece of \npaper. An example of this is with the use of constants; \n\n```python\ncal.add_cns('omega=34 s^-1, d=4 m')\ncal.calc('domega')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: d·ω = 136 m s^-1\n>>> | ω = 34 s^-1\n>>> | d = 4 m\n136\n```\n\nThis also illustrates a feature regarding implicit multiplication, as this is also read properly by the script (which\nis why caution must be made, when defining constants). Note also that the units will be in the displayed result from \nthe console, but they are not a part of the returned output (to obtain the unit, the attribute `.__ans_unit__` can be\ncalled). \nThe result from the calculation can be directly added to the list of constants by calling the attribute function \n`.add_res()` in the call with a specified name:\n\n```python\ncal.add_res('v')\ncal.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n>>> | omega = 34 s^-1\n>>> | d = 4 m\n>>> | v = 136 m s^-1\n```\nNote that a result may be directly added as a constant, by specifying the parameter `add_res` in the `.calc()` call: \n```python\ncal.calc('domega', 'v', cprint=None)\ncal.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n>>> | omega = 34 s^-1\n>>> | d = 4 m\n>>> | v = 136 m s^-1\n```\n\nThis also shows use of the `cprint` (local) kwarg. As opposed to setting the console print option in the `__init__()` \nwhen defining the function as described in [The NumAn object](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy#1-the-numan-object).\nWhen set in `.calc()` it only changes the console print for that single calculation, and all others will follow the \ndefault set in `__init__()`:\n\n```python\ncal.calc('2d/omega', cprint='num')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 2·(4 m)/(34 s^-1) = 0.2353 m s\n0.23529411764705882\n```\n\n```python\ncal.calc('2domega')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 2·d·ω = 272 m s^-1\n>>> | ω = 34 s^-1\n>>> | d = 4 m\n272\n```\n\nAs seen in the former calculation, the significant figures in the console print differs from the output. This is due to \ndescribed evaluation feature `sf` ([The NumAn object](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy#1-the-numan-object)). This\nparameter can also be set locally with a kwarg per calculation: \n\n```python\ncal.add_cns('m=12.3432 g, a=834.2325 m s^-2')\ncal.calc('ma')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: m·a = 10.3 N\n>>> | m = 12.34 g\n>>> | a = 834.2 m\n10.297098594\n```\n\n```python\ncal.calc('ma', sf=6)\n```\n```\n>>> Result: m·a = 10.2971 N\n>>> | m = 12.3432 g\n>>> | a = 834.233 m\n10.297098594\n```\n\nAs seen, the parameter also affects the displayed constants. Another example (also illustrating the use of natural \nconstants): \n\n```python\ncal.add_cns('T=293.15 K')\ncal.calc('T_k')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: T·kᴮ = 4.047e-21 J\n>>> | T = 293.1 K\n4.0473725435e-21\n```\n\nAnother thing to note is that there is native support for many mathematical functions such as the trigonometric functions, \nthe natural logarithm, etc. The full list of supported such functions (including the value of pi), can be found by calling\nthe attribute `.__exclusions__`. Some examples of use: \n\n```python\ncal.calc('sin(deg(45))')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: sin(deg(45)) = 0.8061\n0.8060754911159176\n```\n\n```python\ncal.add_cns('E=0.3 eV')\ncal.calc('exp(E/_kT)')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: exp(-E/(kᴮ·T)) = 6.958e-6 a.u.\n>>> | T = 293.1 K\n>>> | E = 0.3 eV\n6.95757565703751e-06\n```\n\n```python\ncal.calc('sin(2pi)')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: sin(2·π) = 0\n0\n```\nNote that the natural logarithm is denoted by `'ln()'`, whereas log10 is denoted as `'log()'`.\n\n### 4) The units\nA note must be made about the functionality of the units. In general, when computing the units, all given units\nare converted into their respective SI components and then reduced. At last, if they correspond to a _directly_ derived unit\nthe resulting unit will be changed into that derived unit. It is, however, currently quite limited, what the script can \nrecognize as a derived unit. Only the base units e.g. `N, K, J` and the inverse base units; `N^-1, K^-1, J^-1` can be \nfound. If the unit result cannot be recognized as a derived unit, it is simply given as SI units.\n\nThere is currently support for the vast majority of the SI unit derivatives, excluding the candela derived units. There \nis also special support for some other units such as the atomic mass unit (amu or u), Angstrom (Å), atmosphere (atm), etc.\nThe full list of supported units, can be seen by calling the attribute `.supported_units`. \n\nThere is also an important point to be made in regard to denotation of the units in an expression. The working principle\nof the units is that they are essentially multiplicative factors, and so all units act like they are just that. With one\nvery significant exception. When writing units in fractions, if the unit in the denominator consists of multiple units, \nonly the first of those will be read as being in the denominator. This is best illustrated with an example: \n\n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ntest = nsm.NumAn()\ntest.calc('23 m/2 s')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 23 m/2 s = 11.5 m s^-1\n11.5\n```\n```python\ntest.calc('23 m/2 s g')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 23 m/2 s g = 0.0115 m kg s^-1\n0.0115\n```\n\nAs seen in the latter, the expression `'23 m/2 s g'` is being read as `'(23* m/2* s)* g'` rather than `'23* m/(2* s* g)'`.\nDue to this, it is __always__ recommended to write expressions with units in parentheses (this is automatically handled, \nwhen defining constants and using them in expressions, as shown above, so that a constant defined as `'A=4 kg'` will be \nused by the script as `'A=(4 kg)`), especially as this odd functionality may change in the future, but as of now, the way\nto go is: \n\n```python\ntest.calc('23 m/(2 s g)')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: 23 m/(2 s g) = 1.15e+4 m s^-1 kg^-1\n11500\n```\n\nNote that there is currently no support for doing square-roots as `'sqrt(4 m^2)'`:\n```python\ntest.calc('sqrt(4 m^2)')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: sqrt(4 m^2) = 2 m^2\n2\n```\n\n```python\ntest.calc('(4 m^2)^(1/2)')\n```\n```\n>>> Result: (4 m^2)^(1/2) = 2 m\n2\n```\n\n\n### 5) Tips and tricks\nIt may be convenient to reduce the amount of code needed to do computations, especially if the script is run in a console\nenvironment rather than an IDE. This can be done by defining the attribute functions as short variables as follows:\n\n```python\nimport nanoscipy.modules as nsm\ncal = nsm.NumAn()\na = cal.add_cns\nd = cal.del_cns\nc = cal.calc\n```\n\nThen, when adding new constants simply run `a()`, when deleting constants, `d()` and when doing computations `c()`. E.g.: \n\n```python\na('theta=rad(74), gamma=3.412')\nc('gammacos(theta)')\nd('gamma')\ncal.constants()\n```\n```\n>>> Result: γ·cos(θ) = 0.9405\n>>> | θ = 1.292\n>>> | γ = 3.412\n>>> Currently defined constants:\n>>> | theta = 1.2915436464758034\n```\n\n### 6) Disclaimer\nNote importantly that this guide may not be completely up-to-date with the newest version of nanoscipy, as it takes a lot\nof time to re-write and keep an overview of what is in and what is missing. Therefore, I will always recommend to check \nout the [patch notes](https://github.com/nicholas12392/nanoscipy/releases). \nIt is noted in the beginning of the guide, which version the guide is currently up-to-date with. \n</p>\n</details>\n",
