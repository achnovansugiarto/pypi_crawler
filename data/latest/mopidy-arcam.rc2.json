    "description": "************\nMopidy-Arcam\n************\n\n`Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for controlling volume using an\nexternal Arcam amplifier. Developed and tested with an Arcam AVR-300.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall by running::\n\n    sudo pip install Mopidy-Arcam\n\nOr install the Debian/Ubuntu package from `apt.mopidy.com\n<http://apt.mopidy.com/>`_.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe Mopidy-Arcam extension is enabled by default. To disable it, add the\nfollowing to ``mopidy.conf``::\n\n    [arcam]\n    enabled = true\n\nThe Arcam amplifier must be connected to the machine running Mopidy using a\nserial cable.\n\nTo use the Arcam amplifier ot control volume, set the ``audio/mixer`` config\nvalue in ``mopidy.conf`` to ``arcammixer``. You probably also needs to add some\nproperties to the ``audio/mixer`` config value.\n\nSupported properties includes:\n\n``port``:\n    The serial device to use, defaults to ``/dev/ttyUSB0``. This must be\n    set correctly for the mixer to work.\n\n``source``:\n    The source that should be selected on the amplifier, like ``DVD``, ``PVR``,\n    ``VCR``, ``CD``, ``FM``, ``AM``, ``SAT``, ``DVDA``, etc. Leave unset if you don't want the\n    mixer to change it for you.\n\n``speakers-a``:\n    Set to ``on`` or ``off`` if you want the mixer to make sure that\n    speaker set A is turned on or off. Leave unset if you don't want the\n    mixer to change it for you.\n\n``speakers-b``:\n    See ``speakers-a``.\n\nConfiguration examples::\n\n    # Minimum configuration, if the amplifier is available at /dev/ttyUSB0\n    [audio]\n    mixer = arcammixer\n\n    # Minimum configuration, if the amplifier is available elsewhere\n    [audio]\n    mixer = arcammixer port=/dev/ttyAMA0\n\n    # Full configuration\n    [audio]\n    mixer = arcammixer port=/dev/ttyAMA0 source=aux\n\n\nProject resources\n=================\n\n- `Source code <https://github.com/TooDizzy/mopidy-arcam>`_\n- `Issue tracker <https://github.com/TooDizzy/mopidy-arcam/issues>`_\n- `Download development snapshot <https://github.com/TooDizzy/mopidy-arcam/tarball/develop#egg=Mopidy-Arcam-dev>`_\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nv0.1 (2013-10-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Initial version for the Arcam receiver; based on a fork from the NAD mixer.\n\nv0.2 (2013-10-29)\n-----------------\n- Now Mopidy will also handle if the volume of the amplifier is changed outside Mopidy. The volume is updated more or less instanyly and any client will get the updated volume when asking for the volume.",
