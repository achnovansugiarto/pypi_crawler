    "description": "# texonomy\n\n`texonomy`* is a Python tool that facilitates the generation of\nentity-relationship diagrams in $\\LaTeX$ using TikZ.\n\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/basseches/texonomy)](https://github.com/basseches/texonomy)\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/basseches/texonomy/workflows/Build%20Status/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/basseches/texonomy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Status%22)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/basseches/texonomy/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/basseches/texonomy)\n\n*An entity-relationship diagram is more of an ontology than a taxonomy, but\nwhen the shoe fits...\n\n## Overview\n\nWriting $\\LaTeX$ code can be tedious; `texonomy` makes it easier. This tool\ngenerates entity-relationship diagrams in $\\LaTeX$ using a beginner-friendly\nPython interface, so you can spend less time wrestling with missing semicolons.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo install `texonomy`, you'll need `python3.8` or higher and `pip`.\n\nIn order to output as a PDF, you'll need to install some software that includes\n`pdflatex`, like TeX Live (recommended):\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install texlive\nsudo apt-get install texlive-pictures # for TikZ\nsudo apt-get install texlive-plain-generic # for ulem\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall `texonomy` with the following command:\n\n```sh\npip install texonomy\n```\n\n### Example usage\n\nLet's create a very simple program with `texonomy`. First, we'll create\nan Entity object to represent a fruit:\n\n```py\nfruit = Entity(\"Fruit\", [\"SKU\", \"name\", \"price\", \"origin\"])\n```\n\nThe first argument is the entity's name, \"Fruit\". The second argument is a\nlist of the entity's attributes.\n\nLet's create a diagram that contains our fruit entity...\n\n```py\ndiag = ERDiagram(fruit)\n```\n\n...and output the generated $\\LaTeX$ to a file!\n\n```py\nwith open(\"fruit.tex\", \"w\") as er:\n    er.write(diag.to_latex())\n```\n\nThen, you can run `pdflatex` (or something similar) on the command line to\ngenerate a PDF from this $\\LaTeX$:\n\n```sh\npdflatex fruit.tex\n```\n\n<img width=\"150\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-26 at 8 18 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59753614/227814129-0fa23181-eb29-44a7-b2de-3028484a1396.png\">\n\nIt's that simple! Take a look at the programs in `texonomy/tests/integration_tests`\nfor more examples of API usage.\n",
