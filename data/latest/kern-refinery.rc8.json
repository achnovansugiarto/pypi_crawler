It provides an easy-to-use interface for weak supervision as well as extensive data management, neural search, and monitoring to ensure that the quality of your training data is as good as possible.\n\n_refinery_ doesn't get rid of manual labeling, but it makes sure that your valuable time is spent well.\n\n![Showcase GIF of _refinery_](refinery.gif)\n\n> **_DEMO:_**  You can interact with the application in a (mostly read-only) online playground. Check it out [here](https://demo.kern.ai)\n\n_refinery_ consists of multiple microservices to enable a scalable and optimized workload balance, so this is the central repository used to orchestrate the system. It builds on top of [🤗 Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to leverage pre-built language models for your NLP tasks, as well as [qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) for neural search. Our microservices natively support GPU acceleration.\n\n## Table of contents\n- [🧑‍💻 Why _refinery_?

Built for developers with collaboration in mind\nThere are already many other labeling tools out there, so why did we decide to build *yet another one*? \n\n### Open-source and developer-oriented\nWe believe that there is a lack of *open-source, developer-oriented* tools for data-centric NLP. In other terms: developers and scientists should be able to participate in the refinement of raw data to training data, but with the programmatic approach they love. That's why we made sure that integrations to tools like [🤗 Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) are as easy as possible.\n\n\n### For automation or quality control\nThe labeling workflow in _refinery_ is designed to integrate heuristics like labeling functions or active learning modules, which are combined via weak supervision. This way, you can either prototype the training data for your model from scratch, or improve existing training data continuously. We designed our workflow and data management such that you can do exactly that, and find the spots in your data that need to be re-visited.\n\n### Improving collaboration with subject matter experts\nWhile doing so, we aim to improve the collaboration between engineers and subject matter experts (SMEs). In the past, we've seen how our application was being used in meetings to discuss label patterns in form of labeling functions and distant supervisors. We believe that data-centric AI is the best way to leverage collaboration.\n\n### Integrations\nLastly, _refinery_ supports [SDK actions](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python) like pulling and pushing data. Data-centric AI redefines labeling to be more than a one-time job by giving it an iterative workflow, so we aim to give you more power every day by providing end-to-end capabilities, growing the large-scale availability of high-quality training data. Use our SDK to program integrations with your existing landscapes.\n\n\n### Your benefits\nYou gain better insights into the data labeling workflow, receive an implicit documentation for your training data (which you can use to discuss findings), and can ultimately build better models in shorter time.\n\nOur goal is to make labeling feel more like a programmatic and enjoyable task, instead of something tedious and repetitive. _refinery_ is our contribution to this goal. And we're constantly aiming to improve this contribution.\n\nIf you like what we're working on, please leave a ⭐! \n\n## 🤓 Features\n### (Semi-)automated labeling workflow for NLP tasks\n- Both manual and programmatic for classifications and span-labeling\n- Integration with state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks\n- Creation and management of lookup lists/knowledge bases to support during labeling\n- Neural search-based retrieval of similar records and outliers\n- Sliceable labeling sessions to drill-down on specific subsets\n- Multiple labeling tasks possible per project\n\n### Extensive data management and monitoring\n- Integration with [🤗 Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) to automatically create document- and token-level embeddings\n- JSON-based data model for up- and downloads\n- Overview of project metrics like label distributions and confusion matrix\n- Data accessible and extendable via our [Python SDK](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python)\n\n### Team workspaces in the [managed version](https://www.kern.ai/pricing/options)\n- Allow multiple users to label your data\n- Automated calculation of inter-annotator agreements\n\n## ☕ Installation\n\n### From pip\n```\npip install kern-refinery\n```\nOnce the library is installed, go to the directory where you want to store the data and run `refinery start`. This will automatically `git clone` this repository first if you haven't done so yet. To stop the server, run `refinery stop`.\n\n### From repository\n\n**TL;DR:**\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery.git\n$ cd refinery\n```\nIf you're on Mac/Linux:\n```\n$ ./start\n```\nIf you're on Windows:\n```\n$ start.bat\n```\n\nTo stop, type `./stop` (Mac/Linux) or `stop.bat`.\n\n_refinery_ consists of multiple services that need to be run together. To do so, we've set up a setup file, which will automatically pull and connect the respective services for you. The file is part of this repository, so you can just clone it and run `./start` (Mac/Linux) or `start.bat` (Windows) in the repository. After some minutes (now is a good time to grab a coffee ☕), the setup is done and you can access `http://localhost:4455` in your browser. To stop the server, run `./stop` (Mac/Linux) or `./stop.bat` (Windows).\n\n**You're ready to start! 🙌 🎉**\n\nIf you run into any issues during installation, please don't hesitate to reach out to us (see community section below).\n\n### Persisting data\nBy default, we store the data to the directory `refinery/postgres-data`. If you want to change that path, you need to modify the variable `LOCAL_VOLUME` of the `start` script of your operating system. To remove data, simply delete the volume folder. **Make sure to delete only if you don't need the data any longer - this is irreversible!**\n\n## 📘 Documentation and tutorials\nThe best way to start with _refinery_ is our [**quick start**](https://docs.kern.ai/docs/quickstart).\n\nYou can find extensive guides in our [README docs](https://docs.kern.ai/docs) and [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCru-6X24b76TRsL6KWMFEFg/videos) on our YouTube channel. We've also prepared a [repository with sample projects](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects) which you can clone.\n\nIf you need help writing your first labeling functions, look into our [template functions repository](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-template-functions).\n\nYou can find our changelog [here](https://docs.kern.ai/changelog).\n\n## 😵‍💫 Need help?\nNo worries, we've got you.

They don't have to be 100% accurate, heuristics can be e.g. simple Python functions expressing some domain knowledge. When you add and run several of these heuristics, you create what is called a noisy label matrix, that is matched against the reference data that you manually labeled. This allows us to analyze correlations, conflicts, overlaps, the number of hits for a data set, and the accuracy of each heuristic.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>How can I build an active learning model?</b></summary>\n    We use pre-trained models to create embeddings in the first place. Once this is done, the embeddings are available in the application (both for building active learning heuristics and neural search). In our active learning IDE, you can then build a simple classification or extraction head on top of the embedding, and we'll manage then execution in a containerized environment.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>How do I know whether my heuristic is good?</b></summary>\n    A heuristic can be “good” with respect to both coverage and precision. For coverage there basically is no limitation at all, for precision we generally recommend some value above 70%, depending on how many heuristics you have. The more heuristics you have, the more overlaps and conflicts will be given, the better weak supervision can work.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>If I can automate the labeling, why should I train a model at all?</b></summary>\n    Technically, you could use our _refinery_ for inference. However, best results are achieved if a supervised learning model is trained on the generated labels, as these models improve generalization. It’s just a best practice. If you want to use the model for inference, check out our open-source library <a href=\"https://github.com/code-kern-ai/weak-nlp\">weak-nlp</a>.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>I have less than 1,000 records - Do I need this?</b></summary>\n    You can definitely use the system for smaller datasets, too! It now only shines via programmatic labeling, but also has a simple and beautiful UI. Go for it 😁\n</details>\n\n### Technical questions\n<details>\n    <summary><b>Help!! I forgot my password!</b></summary>\n    No worries, you can send a reset link even on your local machine. However, the link isn't sent to your email, but to the mailhog. Access it via <a href=\"http://localhost:4436\">http://localhost:4436</a>.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>I want to install a library for my labeling function</b></summary>\n    For this, we need to change the requirements.txt of the <a href=\"https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-lf-exec-env\">lf-exec-env</a>, the containerized execution environment for your labeling functions. Please just <a href=\"https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery/issues\">open an issue</a>, and we'll integrate your library as soon as possible.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>Which data formats are supported?</b></summary>\n    We’ve structured our data formats around JSON, so you can upload most file types natively. This includes spreadsheets, text files, CSV data, generic JSON and many more.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>How can I upload data?</b></summary>\n    We use <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\">pandas</a> internally for matching your data to our JSON-based data model. You can upload the data via our UI, or via our <a href=\"https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python\">Python SDK</a>.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>How can I download data, and what format does it have?</b></summary>\n    You can download your data in our UI or via the <a href=\"https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python\">Python SDK</a>, where we also provide e.g. adapters to <a href=\"https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa\">Rasa</a>.

It can be used not only to automate data labeling, but generally as an approach to improve your existing label quality. \t|\n| Neural search  \t| Embedding-based approach to retrieve information; instead of telling a machine a set of constraints, neural search analyzes the vector space of data (encoded via e.g. pre-trained neural networks). Can be used e.g. to find nearest neighbors.  \t|\n| Active learning  \t| As data is labeled manually, a model is trained continuously to support the annotator. Can be used e.g. stand-alone, or as a heuristic for weak supervision.  \t|\n| Vector encoding (embedding)  \t| Using pre-trained models such as transformers from [🤗 Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co), texts can be transformed into vector space. This is both helpful for neural search and active learning (in the latter case, simple classifiers can be applied on top of the embedding, which enables fast re-training on the vector representations). \t|\n\nMissing anything in the glossary?
