It is intended to be a\ntool for exploring simulationist approaches to character-driven emergent\nnarratives. Neighborly's simulation architecture is inspired by roguelikes\nsuch as _Caves of Qud_ and _Dwarf Fortress_.\n\nCurrently, Neighborly works best as a narrative data generator. It models\ncharactersâ€™ lives, jobs, routines, relationships, and life\nevents. All of these parts are harnessed to produce\nemergent character backstories as they interact with each other, grow, and\nchange. You can even specify custom characters, businesses, residences,\noccupations, life events, social rules, and more. Neighborly is meant to\nbe customized to the narrative setting of your creative vision. Check out the\nsamples directory to see how we modeled the popular anime, _Demon Slayer_.\n\nNeighborly was inspired by lessons learned from working with\n[_Talk of the Town_](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)\nand aims to give people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more\nopportunities for extension and content authoring.\n\n# Core Features\n\n- Data-driven\n- Add custom character prefabs\n- Add custom business prefabs\n- Define life events and actions to drive narrative generation\n- Define social rules for how characters should feel about each other\n- Define rules for where characters what locations characters should frequent\n- Specify goal-driven behaviors using behavior trees and utility AI\n- Can model various relationship facets like romance, friendship, trust, and respect\n- Collect and export data about agents using Pandas DataFrames\n- Commandline interface (CLI) tool\n- Create plugins to modularize and share custom content\n- Export simulation state to JSON\n- Could be integrated with roguelike development tools like [tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod)\n\n## Not yet supported features\n\n- Generating characters with a subset of character traits randomly selected from a\n  pool of traits\n\n# Installation\n\nNeighborly is available to install from\n[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/neighborly/). This will install the latest\nofficial release.\n\n```bash\npip install neighborly\n```\n\nIf you want to install the most recent changes that have not been uploaded to\nPyPI, you can install it by cloning the main branch of this repo and installing that.\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly.git\n```\n\n## Installing for local development\n\nIf you wish to download a Neighborly for local development or want to play around with\nany of the samples, you need to clone or download this repository and install\nusing the _editable_ flag (-e). Please see the instructions below. This will install\na Neighborly into the virtual environment along with all its dependencies and a few\naddition development dependencies such as _black_ and _isort_ for code formatting.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Clone Repository\ngit clone https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly.git\n\n# Step 2a: Create and activate python virtual environment\ncd neighborly\n\n# Step 2b: For Linux and MacOS\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\n\n# Step 2b: For Windows\npython -m venv venv\n./venv/Scripts/Activate\n\n# Step 3: Install local build and dependencies\npython -m pip install -e \".[development,testing]\"\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nIf you want examples of how to use Neighborly and how to extend it\nwith custom content, please refer to\n[Neighborly's docs](https://shijbey.github.io/neighborly/) and the sample scripts\nin the [`samples` directory](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/tree/main/samples).\n\n## Using as a library\n\nNeighborly can be used as a library within a Python script or package.\nThe `samples` directory contains python scripts that use Neighborly this\nway. Please refer to them when creating new Plugins and other content.\n\n## Writing plugins\n\nUsers can extend Neighborly's default content/behavior using plugins.\nA few default plugins come prepackaged with Neighborly to help people get\nstarted. Plugins are implemented as Python packages or modules and are\nimported by passing their name in the `plugins` section of the configuration.\n\nPlease see the [Plugins](https://shijbey.github.io/neighborly/plugins.html)\nsection of the documentation for more information about authoring plugins.\n\n## Running the CLI\n\nNeighborly can be run as a module `$ python -m neighborly` or commandline `$ neighborly`\nscript. If you require additional help while running, please use\n`$ python -m neighborly --help` or `$ neighborly --help`.\n\nBy default, Neighborly runs a builtin version of **Talk of the Town**. However, you can\nconfigure the simulation settings by creating a `neighborlyconfig.yaml` file in\nthe same directory where you're running the CLI.\n\nWhen world generation concludes, Neighborly can write the final simulation data\nto a JSON file with the seed used for world generation.\n\n## Running the Samples\n\nNeighborly provides sample simulations to show users how to customize\nit to create new story world themes.\n\n```bash\n# Make sure that you've activated your python virtual environment\n# Replace <sample_name>.py with the name of the\n# sample you want to run\npython ./samples/<sample_name>.py\n```\n\nThe samples in the `notebooks` directory require Jupyter to be installed. So you will\nneed to run the following command to install all the needed dependencies.\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install -e \".[samples]\"\n```\n\nThen start Jupyter and pass the relative path to the `notebooks` directory. The following\nassumes that the command is being run from the root of the project.\n\n```bash\nnotebook ./samples/notebooks\n```\n\n## Running the Tests\n\nTesting is very important. It is how we are able to ensure that new changes don't\nbreak anything. I do my best to keep tests updated, but some tests may be out of\ndate and refer to systems and logic that no longer exist in Neighborly.\n\nFeel free to contribute tests by forking the repo, adding your test(s), and\nsubmitting a pull request with a description of your test cases. Your commits\nshould only contain changes to files within the `tests` directory. If you\nchange any files in other parts of the project, your PR will be rejected.\n\nPlease follow the steps below to run Neighborly's test suite. Neighborly uses\n[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) to handle unit testing.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Install dependencies for tests\npython -m pip install -e \".[testing]\"\n\n# Step 2: Run Pytest\npytest\n\n# Step3 : (Optional) Generate a test coverage report\npytest --cov=neighborly tests/\n```\n\n# Documentation\n\nThe most up-to-date documentation can be found [here](https://shijbey.github.io/neighborly/)\n\nNeighborly uses [Numpy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)\ndocstrings in code. When adding docstrings for existing or new bits of code please use the following\nreferences for how to format your contributions:\n\n- [Sphinx Napoleon Plugin for processing Numpy Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)\n- [Example Numpy Style Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html#example-numpy)\n\n## Building the documentation\n\nNeighborly's docs are built using Sphinx. Below are instructions for building the docs\n\n```bash\n\n# Install the documentation dependencies\npython -m pip install -e \".[docs]\"\n\n# Build docs as HTML\nsphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/module_docs/ src/neighborly\nsphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html\n```\n\nIf you happen to have _npm_ installed, you can use the `package.json` configuration file to\nrun build, clean build output, and run a test HTTP server.\n\n# Contributing\n\nHere are some ways that people can contribute to Neighborly:\n\n1. Proposing/Implementing new features\n2. Fixing bugs\n3. Providing optimizations\n4. Filing issues\n5. Contributing tutorials and how-to guides\n6. Fixing grammar and spelling\n7. Creating new samples and plugins\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to Neighborly, there are multiple ways to get\ninvolved, and not all of them require you to be proficient with GitHub. Interested\nparties can contribute to the core code base of Neighborly and create new content\nin the way of plugins. I love feedback, and if you have any questions, create a new\nissue, and I will do my best to answer. If you want to contribute to the core code,\nfree to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull-request with a\ndescription of your contribution. Please keep in mind that this project is a\ntool for creativity and learning. I have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to\nencourage healthy collaboration, and will enforce it if I need to.\n\n# Code Style\n\nNeighborly uses [_Black_](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to handle code style\nand sorts imports using [_isort_](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).\n\n# DMCA Statement\n\nUpon receipt of a notice alleging copyright infringement, I will take whatever action it\ndeems appropriate within its sole discretion, including removal of the allegedly\ninfringing materials.\n\nThe repo image is something fun that I made. I love _The Simpsons_, and I couldn't think\nof anyone more neighborly than Ned Flanders. If the copyright owner for _The Simpsons_\nwould like me to take it down, please contact me. The same takedown policy applies to\nany code samples inspired by TV shows, movies, and games.\n",
