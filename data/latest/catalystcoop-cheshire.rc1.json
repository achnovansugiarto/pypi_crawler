It contains a lot of infrastructure surrounding a minimal Python package named\n``cheshire`` (the cat who isn't entirely there...).\n\nCreate a new repository from this template\n=======================================================================================\n\n* Choose a name for the new package that you are creating.\n* The name of the repository should be the same as the name of the new Python package\n  you are going to create. E.g. a repository at ``catalyst-cooperative/cheshire`` should\n  be used to define a package named ``cheshire``.\n* Fork this template repository to create a new Python project repo.\n  `See these instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template>`__.\n* Clone the new repository to your development machine.\n* Run ``pre-commit install`` in the newly clone repository to install the\n  `pre-commit hooks <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ defined in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``\n* Create the ``cheshire`` conda environment by running ``conda env create`` or\n  (preferably) ``mamba env create`` in the top level of the repository.\n* Activate the new conda environment with ``conda activate cheshire``.\n* Run ``tox`` from the top level of the repository to verify that everything is working\n  correctly.\n\nRename the package and distribution\n=======================================================================================\n\nOnce you know that your forked version of the ``cheshire`` package is working as\nexpected, you should update the package and distribution names in your new repo to\nreflect the name of your new package. The **package name** is determined by the name of\nthe directory under ``src/`` which contains the source code, and is the name you'll use\nto import the package for use in a program, script, or notebook. E.g.:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import cheshire\n\nThe **distribution name** is the name that is used to install the software using a\nprogram like  ``pip``, ``conda``, or ``mamba``. It is often identical to the package\nname, but can also contain a prefix namespace that indicates the individual or\norganization responsible for maintaining the pacakge. See :pep:`423`\n`PEP 423 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0423/>`__ for more on Python package naming\nconventions. We are using the ``catalystcoop`` namespace for the packages that we\npublish, so our ``pudl`` package becomes ``catalystcoop.pudl`` in the\nPython Package Index (PyPI) or on ``conda-forge``. Similarly the ``cheshire`` package\nbecomes the ``catalystcoop.cheshire`` distribution. The distribution name is determined\nby the ``name`` argument in the call to ``setup()`` in ``setup.py``.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  pip install catalystcoop.cheshire\n\nThe package and distribution names are referenced in many of the files in the template\nrepository, and they all need to be replaced with the name of your new package. You can\nuse ``grep -r`` to search recursively through all of the files for the word ``cheshire``\nat the command line, or use the search-and-replace functionality of your IDE / text\neditor. The name of the package directory under ``src/`` will also need to be changed.\n\n* Supply any required tokens, e.g. for CodeCov\n* Rename the ``src/cheshire`` directory to reflect the new package name.\n* Search for ``cheshire`` and replace it as appropriate everywhere. Sometimes\n  this will be with a distribution name like ``catalystcoop.cheshire``\n  (the package as it appears for ``pip`` or ``PyPI``) and sometimes this will be the\n  importable package name (the name of the directory under ``src`` e.g. ``cheshire``)\n* Create the new project / package at Read The Docs.\n\nWhat this template provides\n=======================================================================================\n\nPython Package Skeleton\n-----------------------\n* The ``src`` directory contains the code that will be packaged and deployed on the user\n  system. That code is in a directory with the same name as the package.\n* Using a separate ``src`` directory helps avoid accidentally importing the package when\n  you're working in the top level directory of the repository.\n* A simple python module (``dummy.py``), and a separate module providing a command line\n  interface to that module (``cli.py``) are included as examples.\n* Any files in the ``src/package_data/`` directory will also be packaged and deployed.\n* What files are included in or excluded from the package on the user's system is\n  controlled by the ``MANIFEST.in`` file and some options in the call to ``setup()`` in\n  ``setup.py``.\n* The CLI is deployed using a ``console_script`` entrypoint defined in ``setup.py``.\n* We use ``setuptools_scm`` to obtain the package's version directly from ``git`` tags,\n  rather than storing it in the repository and manually updating it.\n* ``README.rst`` is read in and used for the pacakge's ``long_description``. This is\n  what is displayed on the PyPI page for the package. For example, see the\n  `PUDL Catalog <https://pypi.org/project/catalystcoop.pudl-catalog/0.1.0/>`__ page.\n* By default we create at least three sets of \"extras\" -- additional optional package\n  dependencies that can be installed in special circumstances: ``dev``, ``docs```, and\n  ``tests``. The packages listed there are used in development, building the docs, and\n  running the tests (respectively) but aren't required for a normal user who is just\n  installing the package from ``pip`` or ``conda``.\n* Python has recently evolved a more diverse community of build and packaging tools.\n  Which flavor is being used by a given package is indicated by the contents of\n  ``pyproject.toml``. That file also contains configuration for a few other tools,\n  including ``black`` and ``isort``, described in the section on linters and formatters\n  below.\n\nPytest Testing Framework\n------------------------\n* A skeleton `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_ testing setup is included in the\n  ``tests/`` directory.\n* Tests are split into ``unit`` and ``integration`` categories.\n* Session-wide test fixtures, additional command line options, and other pytest\n  configuration can be added to ``tests/conftest.py``\n* Exactly what pytest commands are run during continuous integration controlled by Tox.\n* Pytest can also be run manually without using Tox, but will use whatever your\n  personal python environment happens to be, rather than the one specified by the\n  package. Running pytest on its own is a good way to debug new or failing tests\n  quickly, but we should always use Tox and its virtual environment for actual testing.\n\nTest Coordination with Tox\n--------------------------\n* We define several different test environments for use with Tox in ``tox.ini``\n* `Tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`__ is used to run pytest in an isolated Python\n  virtual environment.\n* We also use Tox to coordinate running the code linters, building the documentation,\n  and releasing the software to PyPI.\n* The default Tox environment is named ``ci`` and it will run the linters, build the\n  documentation, run all the tests, and generate test coverage statistics.\n* ``tox.ini`` also contains sections near the bottom which configure the behavior of\n  ``doc8``, ``flake8``, ``pytest``, and ``rstcheck``.\n\nGit Pre-commit Hooks\n--------------------\n* A variety of sanity checks are defined as git pre-commit hooks -- they run any time\n  you try to make a commit, to catch common issues before they are saved. Many of these\n  hooks are taken from the excellent `pre-commit project <https://pre-commit.com/>`__.\n* The hooks are configured in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``\n* For them to run automatically when you try to make a commit, you **must** install the\n  pre-commit hooks in your cloned repository first. This only has to be done once.\n* These checks are run as part of our CI, and the CI will fail if the pre-commit hooks\n  fail.\n* We also use the `pre-commit.ci <https://pre-commit.ci>`__ service to run the same\n  checks on any code that is pushed to GitHub, and to apply standard code formatting\n  to the PR in case it hasn't been run locally prior to being committed.\n\nCode Formatting\n---------------\nTo avoid the tedium of meticulously formatting all the code ourselves, and to ensure as\nstandard style of formatting and sytactical idioms across the codebase, we use several\nautomatic code formatters, which run as pre-commit hooks. Many of them can also be\nintegrated direclty into your text editor or IDE with the appropriate plugins. The\nfollowing formatters are included in the template ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``:\n\n* `Use only absolute import paths <https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/absolufy-imports>`__\n* `Standardize the sorting of imports <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`__\n* `Remove unneccesary f-strings <https://github.com/dannysepler/rm_unneeded_f_str>`__\n* `Upgrade type hints for built-in types <https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade>`__\n* `Upgrade Python syntax <https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade>`__\n* `Deterministic formatting with Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__\n* We also have a custom hook that clears Jupyter notebook outputs prior to committing.\n\nCode & Documentation Linters\n----------------------------\nTo catch errors before commits are made, and to ensure uniform formatting across the\ncodebase, we also use a bunch of different linters. They don't change the code or\ndocumentation files, but they will raise an error or warning when something doesn't\nlook right so you can fix it.\n\n* `bandit <https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ identifies code patterns known\n  to cause security issues.\n* `doc8 <https://github.com/pycqa/doc8>`__ and `rstcheck\n  <https://github.com/myint/rstcheck>`__ look for formatting issues in our docstrings\n  and the standalone ReStructuredText (RST) files under the ``docs/`` directory.\n* `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`__ is an extensible Python linting\n  framework, with a bunch of plugins.\n* `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`__ Does static type checking,\n  and ensures that our code uses type annotations.\n* `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`__ has a collection of built-in checks that `use\n  pygrep to search Python files <https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks>`__ for\n  common problems like blanket ``# noqa`` annotations, as well as `language agnostic\n  problems <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks>`__ like accidentally\n  checking large binary files into the repository or having unresolved merge conflicts.\n\nTest Coverage\n-------------\n* We use Tox and a the pytest `coverage <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.2/>`__\n  plugin to measure and record what percentage of our codebase is being tested, and to\n  identify which modules, functions, and individual lines of code are not being\n  exercised by the tests.\n* When you run ``tox`` or ``tox -e ci`` (which is equivalent) a summary of the test\n  coverage will be printed at the end of the tests (assuming they succeed). The full\n  details of the test coverage is written to ``coverage.xml``.\n* There are some configuration options for this process set in the ``.coveragerc`` file\n  in the top level directory of the repository.\n* When the tests are run via the ``tox-pytest`` workflow in GitHub Actions, the test\n  coverage data from the ``coverage.xml`` output is uploaded to a service called\n  `CodeCov <https://about.codecov.io/>`__ that saves historical data about our test\n  coverage, and provides a nice visual representation of the data -- identifying which\n  subpackages, modules, and individual lines of are being tested. For example, here are\n  the results\n  `for the cheshire repo <https://app.codecov.io/gh/catalyst-cooperative/cheshire>`__.\n* The connection to CodeCov is configured in the ``.codecov.yml`` YAML file.\n* In theory, we should be able to automatically turn CodeCov on for all of our GitHub\n  repos, and it just Just Work, but in practice we've had to turn it on in the GitHub\n  configuration one-by-one. Open source repositories are also supposed to be able to\n  upload to the CodeCov site without requiring authentication, but this also hasn't\n  worked, so thus far we've needed to request a new token for each repository. This\n  token is stored in ``.codecov.yml``.\n* Once it's enabled, CodeCov also adds a couple of test coverage checks to any pull\n  request, to alert us if a PR reduces overall test coverage (which we would like to\n  avoid).\n\nDocumentation Builds\n--------------------\n* We build our documentation using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__.\n* Standalone docs files are stored under the ``docs/`` directory, and the Sphinx\n  configuration is there in ``conf.py`` as well.\n* We use `Sphinx AutoAPI <https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to\n  convert the docstrings embedded in the python modules under ``src/`` into additional\n  documentation automatically.\n* The top level documentation index simply includes this ``README.rst``, the\n  ``LICENSE.txt`` and ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`` files are similarly referenced. The only\n  standalone documentation file under ``docs/`` right now is the ``release_notes.rst``.\n* Unless you're debugging something specific, the docs should always be built using\n  ``tox -e docs`` as that will lint the source files using ``doc8`` and ``rstcheck``,\n  and wipe previously generated documentation to build everything from scratch. The docs\n  are also rebuilt as part of the normal Tox run (equivalent to ``tox -e ci``).\n* If you add something to the documentation generation process that needs to be cleaned\n  up after, it should be integrated with the Sphinx hooks. There are some examples of\n  how to do this at the bottom of ``docs/conf.py`` in the \"custom build operations\"\n  section. For example, this is how we automatically regenerate the data dictionaries\n  based on the PUDL metadata whenever the docs are built, ensuring that the docs stay up\n  to date.\n\nDocumentation Publishing\n------------------------\n* We use the popular `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.io>`__ service to host our\n  documentation.\n* When you open a PR, push to ``dev`` or ``main``, or tag a release, the associated\n  documentation is automatically built on Read the Docs.\n* There's some minimal configuration stored in the ``.readthedocs.yml`` file, but\n  setting up this integration for a new repository requires some setup on the Read the\n  Docs site.\n* Create an account on Read the Docs using your GitHub identity, go to \"My Projects\"\n  under the dropdown menu in the upper righthand corner, and click on \"Import a\n  Project.\" It should list the repositories that you have access to on GitHub. You may\n  need to click on the Catalyst Cooperative logo in the right hand sidebar.\n* It will ask you for a project name -- this will become part of the domain name for the\n  documentation page on RTD and should be the same as the distribution name, but with\n  dots and underscores replaced with dashes. E.g. ``catalystcoop-cheshire`` or\n  ``catalystcoop-pudl-catalog``.\n* Under Advanced Settings, make sure you\n  `enable builds on PRs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html>`__.\n  This will add a check ensuring that the documentation has built successfully on RTD\n  for any PR in the repo.\n* Under the Builds section for the new project (repo) you'll need to tell it which\n  branches you want it to build, beyond the default ``main`` branch.\n* Once the repository is connected to Read the Docs, an initial build of the\n  documentation from the ``main`` branch should start.\n\nDependabot\n----------\nWe use GitHub's `Dependabot <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates>`__\nto automatically update the allowable versions of packages we depend on. This applies\nto both the Python dependencies specified in ``setup.py`` and to the versions of the\n`GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`__ that we employ. The dependabot\nbehavior is configured in ``.github/dependabot.yml``\n\nGitHub Actions\n--------------\nUnder ``.github/workflows`` are YAML files that configure the `GitHub Actions\n<https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`__ associated with the repository. We use GitHub\nActions primarily to:\n\n* Run continuous integration using `tox <https://tox.wiki>`__ on several different\n  versions of Python.\n* Build a Docker container with `repo2docker <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repo2docker-action>`__\n  which encapsulates the conda environment defined by the top level ``environment.yml``\n  Note that for this action to succeed, you will need to\n  `create a personal access token on Docker Hub <https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/>`__\n  and create new repository secrets to store your username and token called\n  ``DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`` and ``DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`` and make sure that the Docker Hub\n  repository you're trying to push to exists.\n\nAbout Catalyst Cooperative\n=======================================================================================\n`Catalyst Cooperative <https://catalyst.coop>`__ is a small group of data\nwranglers and policy wonks organized as a worker-owned cooperative consultancy.\nOur goal is a more just, livable, and sustainable world. We integrate public\ndata and perform custom analyses to inform public policy (`Hire us!\n<https://catalyst.coop/hire-catalyst>`__).
