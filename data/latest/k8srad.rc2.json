With the usage of pre-given component a lot of development tasks are omitted which rapidly accelerates the software development.\n\nYOTRON put this development principles one step ahead and uses a **Kubernetes-ready Rapid Application Development** framework.\nThe Kubernetes deployment is integrated part of the software development, means the software we provide for you is Kubernetes-Ready out-of-the-box.\n\nThis is the default application, which is the starting point of the Rapid Application Development. Please see the [description](https://www.yotron.deblog/kuberentesreadyrad/).\n\n## URLs\nThe project contains code, build packages, container ... . Below an overview:\n\n| Type                  | Provider                        | URL                                                            |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kubernetes-Ready RAD  | yotron.de                       | https://www.yotron.de/blog/kuberentesreadyrad/                 |\n| Container             | hub.docker.com                  | https://hub.docker.com/r/yotronpublic/k8srad                   | \n| Python Package (PyPi) | pypi.org                        | https://pypi.org/project/k8srad/                               |  \n| HELM package          | artifacthub.io / helm.yotron.de | https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/yotron-helm-charts/k8srad |\n\n## Installation\nWe provide two installation methods. A native installation on any OS which supports Python3 and a installation in Kubernetes via HELM.\nPer default, K8SRAD runs on a sqlite database. Sqlite is recommended only for testing and on a standalone installation.\n\nIn production, you should use a PostgreSQL database for a better data persistency and to allow a HA setup with more K8SRAD nodes.\n\nThe K8SRAD has no TLS-termination (\"https\"). We recommend to use a Reverse Proxy like NGINX or Apache Web Server in front of K8SRAD Web App for TLS termination.\n\nThe HELM project of K8SRAD for Kubernetes contains all needed and recommended components. You can optionally install a NGINX Reverse Proxy and a PostgreSQL database with the project,\nbut you can also use separated applications.\n\n### Native\n#### Prerequisites\n- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)\n- [Python-pip](https://pip.pypa.io) for dependency installation\n- OpenLDAP for LDAP authentication\n- SSL for secured LDAP authentication\n- recommended: python3-venv to create a virtual environment for Python3\n- recommended: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database for the K8SRAD metadata\n- recommended: A reverse proxy with TLS termination (e.g. NGINX).\n\n#### Prerequisites Python and pip\nK8SRAD supports all current Python3 versions. It is tested with Python 3.9.x and 3.10.x\n\nTo check which Python version is running:\n```\nvagrant@bullseye:~$ python3 -V\nPython 3.9.2\n``` \nTo check which Pip version is running:\n``` \nvagrant@bullseye:~$ pip3 -V\npip 20.3.4 from /home/vagrant/k8srad/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)\n``` \n\nIt is possible, that in your distribution Python must be called with `python` and `pip`.\n\nIf you need a Python installation from the scratch. Python3, Pip3 and python3-venv are available in the main OS distribution.\n\nFor Debian/Ubuntu:\n`sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`\n\nFor RedHat/CentOS:\n`sudo yum install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`\n\n#### Prerequisites OpenLDAP and SSL\nFor authentication packages for authentication like OpenLDAP and SSL are needed  \nFor Debian/Ubuntu:\n`sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev`\n\nFor RedHat/CentOS:\n`sudo yum install python-devel openldap-devel`\n\n#### Installation\nThere are a lot of variants how to start a Python web project. We use a Python virtual environment for setting up K8SRAD on a virtual environment. \nDepend on your environment and knowledge in Python the process can be different.\n\n1. Create a virtual environment of Python\n \n   1. Create a virtual environment for K8SRAD\n   \n      ```\n      vagrant@bullseye:~$ python3 -m venv venv\n      ```\n\n   2. Activate your virtual environment\n\n      This steps is to repeat every time you want to restart K8SRAD.\n   \n      ```\n      vagrant@bullseye:~$ source venv/bin/activate\n      (venv) vagrant@bullseye:~$\n      ```\n\n3. Install all Python dependencies needed for the project:\n\n   ```   \n   (k8srad) vagrant@bullseye:~$ pip install k8srad --upgrade\n   ```\n\n4. Start K8SRAD server\n   ```   \n   (k8srad) vagrant@bullseye:~$ k8srad-run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080\n   2022-10-06 15:21:07,382:INFO:flask_appbuilder.base:Registering class View on menu \n   ...\n   2022-10-10 11:18:22,385:INFO:flask_appbuilder.baseviews:Registering route / ('GET',)\n   2022-10-10 11:18:22,424:INFO:waitress:Serving on http://0.0.0.0:8080\n   ```\n\n4. Open Browser and start K8SRAD with one of the IPs mentioned above:\n\n   ![Login Site of K8SRAD](https://www.yotron.de/k8srad/login.png)\n\n   Your will automatically redirected to http://x.x.x.x:8080/login\n\n5. Login as a admin user\n   \n   The default credentials for the admin user are:\n \n   **Username**: admin\n\n   **Password**: admin\n\n   ![Dashboard of K8SRAD](https://www.yotron.de/k8srad/dashboard_item_empty.png)\n\n   Please see the [manual](https://www.yotron.de/k8srad/) to allow access to buckets.\n\n\n### HELM\nYou find the installation instructions for Kubernetes [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/yotron-helm-charts/k8srad)\n\n## Manual\nThe manual for K8SRAD you find [here](https://www.yotron.deblog/kuberentesreadyrad/)\n\n## Configuration\n### The dotenv file and `K8SRAD_CONF_FILE` variable\nYou can customize K8SRAD with a setting defined in a dotenv file. The dotenv file can be chosen freely and you can put the file in a folder of your choice but \nthe file must be reachable by the K8SRAD App. \n\nAdditionally, you need a environment variable `K8SRAD_CONF_FILE` with the path to your config file.\n\nFor example, for Linux you can set the environment variable with:\n```\nexport K8SRAD_CONF_FILE=/etc/k8srad/.k8srad\n```\nwith `.k8srad` as the dotenv file name.\n\nThe file contains setting to the following topics:\n- customization of your K8SRAD\n- Authentication\n\n### The parameter of the config file\n#### Kubernetes RAD\n\n| name                   | example                              | description                                                                                                            | possible values                    | default |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| K8SRAD_APP_NAME        | My Fancy Kuberrentes App             | The name of your K8SRAD.
