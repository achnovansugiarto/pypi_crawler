    "description": "# Description\n\nA python module for driving the CAD-to-Solution workflow based on [refine](https://github.com/nasa/refine) with [Engineering Sketch Pad](https://acdl.mit.edu/ESP/).\n\n# Installation\nIf you will be creating custom drivers, controller, etc., it is recommended that you\nclone the pyrefine repository and do a developer (in place) installation of pyrefine:\nfrom the root directory do `pip install -e .`. This allows you to edit pyrefine without\nhaving to reinstall to get new changes.\n\nOtherwise, you can use `pip install pyrefine`.\n\n## Post processing scripts\nWhile not required, for the main pyrefine package, some of the post processing and adaptation monitoring GUIs use [plotly and the open-source version of dash](https://plotly.com/).\nTo use these utilities, you'll need to `pip install plotly dash` or `conda install plotly dash`.\n\n# Documentation\n[Documentation is hosted using Github Pages](https://nasa.github.io/pyrefine/)\n\nThe pyrefine documentation is generated from the source code with Sphinx.\nIf you do not already have sphinx installed, you can use `pip` or `conda` to install it.\nOnce you have installed or added pyrefine to your PYTHONPATH, the documentation is built by running `make html` in the docs directory.\nThe generated documentation will be in `docs/build/html`.\n\n\n# Quick Start\n\nAfter installation,\n\n```\ncd examples/onera_m6/geometry\n./om6ste.sh\ncd ../steady_sa\n```\n\nOn the NASA K cluster, run:\n```\npython adapt.py\n```\n\nOn pfe, set your group name in `adapt_nas.py` then run the script:\n```\npython adapt_nas.py\n```\nIn both cases the scripts are run from the login nodes and will launch pbs jobs for refine, fun3d, etc.\n\n\n# License Notices and Disclaimers\n\nNotices: Copyright 2022 United States Government as represented by the\nAdministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
