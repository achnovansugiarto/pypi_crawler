The reward in this game is proportional to your score (i.e., number of plants eaten).\n  - In \"Match Word Puzzle\", your goal is to find matching pairs of words out of all tiles on the board as fast as possible.\n  The reward in this game is inversely proportional to your time taken to match all pairs of words.\n  - In \"Match-3 Game\", your goal is to swap tiles to get matching tiles (tiles can be removed after at least 3 \n  consecutive matching tiles are present).
