Is\nspecially indicated for high-demand instances and for when there are custom\nprocesses that take long to complete. Essentially, `senaite.queue` reduces the\nchance of transaction commits by handling tasks asynchronously, in an\nunattended and sequential manner.\n\nOnce installed, this add-on enables asynchronous processing of those tasks that\nusually have a heavier footprint regarding performance, and with highest chance\nof transaction conflicts:\n\n* Assignment of analyses to worksheets\n* Assignment of worksheet template to a worksheet\n* Creation of a worksheet by using a worksheet template\n* Workflow actions (submit, verify, etc.) for analyses assigned to worksheets\n* Recursive permissions assignment on client contacts creation\n\nThis add-on neither provides support for workflow transitions/actions at Sample\nlevel nor for Sample creation. However, this add-on can be extended easily to\nmatch additional requirements.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n* https://senaitequeue.readthedocs.io\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nWe want contributing to SENAITE.QUEUE to be fun, enjoyable, and educational\nfor anyone, and everyone.

Most of the base code has been refactored\nkeeping in mind the following objectives:\n\n* Less complexity: less code, better code\n* Less chance of transaction commit conflicts\n* Boost performance: better experience, with no delays\n\nAll these changes also makes the add-on easier to extend and maintain. The\ndownside is that old legacy storage is no longer used and therefore, tasks that\nwere queued before the upgrade will be discarded.\n\n* Be sure there are no remaining tasks in the queue before the upgrade\n* If you have your own add-on extending ``senaite.queue``, please review the changes\n  and check if some parts of your add-on require modifications\n\nA queue server has been introduced. Therefore, two zeo clients are recommended:\none that acts as the server and at least another one in charge of consuming\ntasks. Also, this version now depends on three additional packages: ``requests``,\n``senaite.jsonapi`` and ``cryptography``. Please read the installation\ninstructions and run buildout to download the dependencies.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIs strongly recommended to have a SENAITE instance setup in ZEO mode, because\nthis add-on is especially useful when a reserved zeo client is used to act as\na queue server and at least one additional zeo client for tasks consumption.\n\nIn standalone installation, only one CPU / CPU core can be used for processing\nrequests, with a limited number of threads (usually 2). With a ZEO mode setup,\nthe database can be used by multiple zeo clients at the same time, each one\nusing it's own CPU. See `Scalability and ZEO`_ for further information.\n\nCreate a new reserved user in SENAITE instance (under */senaite/acl_users*). The\nrecommended username is *queue_consumer*.\n\nThis user will be used by the consumer to pop tasks from the queue server in a\nsequential manner. The consumer will eventually process the task, but acting as\nthe user who initially triggered the process. However, the reserved user\nresponsible of dispatching must have enough privileges. Assign this user to\nthe group \"Site Administrator\" and/or \"Manager\".\n\nFirst, add this add-on in the `eggs` section of your buildout configuration file:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    [instance]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        senaite.queue\n\n\nThen, add a two clients (a consumer and the server) in your buildout\nconfiguration:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    # Reserved user for dispatching queued tasks\n    # See https://pypi.org/project/senaite.queue\n    queue-user-name=queue_consumer\n    queue-user-password=queue_consumer_password\n\n    parts =\n        ....\n        queue_consumer\n        queue_server\n\n\nand configure two reserved clients:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [queue_consumer]\n    # ZEO Client reserved for the consumption of queued tasks\n    <= client_base\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    http-address = 127.0.0.1:8089\n    zope-conf-additional =\n        <clock-server>\n            method /senaite/queue_consume\n            period 5\n            user ${buildout:queue-user-name}\n            password ${buildout:queue-user-password}\n            host localhost:8089\n        </clock-server>\n\n    [queue_server]\n    # ZEO Client reserved to act as the server of the queue\n    <= client_base\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    http-address = 127.0.0.1:8090\n\n.. note:: These clients will listen to ports 8089 and 8090. They should not be\n          accessible to regular users. Thus, if you use a load-balancer\n          (e.g HAProxy), is strongly recommended to not add these clients in\n          the backend pool.\n\nIn most scenarios, this configuration is enough. However, senaite.queue supports\nmulti consumers, that can be quite useful for those SENAITE installations that\nhave a very high overload. To add more consumers, add as many zeo client\nsections as you need with the additional `clock-server` zope configuration. Do\nnot forget to set the value `host` correctly to all them, because this value is\nused by the queue server to identify the consumers when tasks are requested.\n\nThe maximum number of concurrent consumers supported by the queue server is 4.\n\nRun `bin/buildout` afterwards. With this configuration, buildout will download\nand install the latest published release of `senaite.queue from Pypi`_.\n\n.. note:: If the buildout fails with a ``ImportError: cannot import name aead``,\n          please update OpenSSL to v1.1.1 or above. OpenSSL v1.0.2 is no longer\n          supported by ``cryptography`` starting from v3.2. Please, read the\n          `changelog from cryptography`_ for further information. Although not\n          recommended, you can alternatively stick to version 3.1.1 by adding\n          ``cryptography=3.1.1`` in ``[versions]`` section from your buildout.\n\nOnce buildout finishes, start the clients:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ sudo -u plone_daemon bin/client1 start\n    $ sudo -u plone_daemon bin/queue_server start\n    $ sudo -u plone_daemon bin/queue_client start\n\n.. note:: ``plone_daemon`` is the default user created by the quick-installer\n          when installing Plone in ZEO cluster mode. Please check\n          `Installation of Plone`_ for further information. You might need to\n          change this user name depending on how you installed SENAITE.\n\nThen visit your SENAITE site and login with a user with \"Site Administrator\"\nprivileges to activate the add-on:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/senaite/prefs_install_products_form\n\n.. note:: It assumes you have a SENAITE zeo client listening to port 8080\n\nOnce activated, go to `Site Setup > Queue Settings` and, in field \"Queue Server\",\ntype the url of the zeo client that will act as the server of the queue.\n\nhttp://localhost:8090/senaite\n\n.. note:: Do not forget to specify the site id in the url (usually \"senaite\")\n\n\n..
