Overview\n\nSparsify is an easy-to-use UI tool that simplifies the deep learning model [sparsification](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/main/source/getstarted.html#sparsification) process to rapidly achieve the best combination of size, speed, and accuracy. \nIt sparsifies and benchmarks models informed by industry research insights for ML practitioners, including ML engineers and operators, who need to deploy performant deep learning models fast and at scale. \nSparsify shows visual performance potential for your model, including a sliding scale between performance and recovery, ultimately speeding up the model sparsification process from weeks to minutes.\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify) contains the package to locally launch Sparsify where you can create projects to load and sparsify your deep learning models. \nAt the end, you can export sparsification recipes to integrate with your training workflow.\n\n<img alt=\"Sparsify Flow\" src=\"https://docs.neuralmagic.com/docs/source/infographics/sparsify.png\" width=\"960px\" />\n\n## Highlights\n\n- [User Guide](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsify/source/userguide/01-intro.html)\n\n## Tutorials\n\nComing soon!\n\n## Installation\n\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.7-3.9, Linux/Debian systems, and Chrome 87+.\nIt is recommended to install in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep your system in order.\n\nInstall with pip using:\n\n```bash\npip install sparsify\n```\n\nDepending on your flow, PyTorch, Keras, or TensorFlow must be installed in the local environment along with Sparsify to export recipes through the UI.\n\n## Quick Tour\n\nA console script entry point is installed with the package: `sparsify`.\nThis enables easy interaction through your console/terminal.\n\nNote, for some environments the console scripts cannot install properly.\nIf this happens for your system and the `sparsify` command is not available,\n`scripts/main.py` may be used in its place.  Documentation is provided in the\nscript file.\n\nTo launch Sparsify locally, open up a console or terminal window and enter the following:\n\n```bash\nsparsify\n```\n\nThe Sparsify server will begin running locally on the machine and can be accessed through a web browser.\nThe default host:port Sparsify starts on is `0.0.0.0:5543`.\nTherefore, after starting Sparsify with the default commands, you may enter the following into a web browser to begin using Sparsify: `http://0.0.0.0:5543`.\n\nIf you are running Sparsify on a separate server from where the web browser is located,\nthen you will need to substitute in the proper IP address for that server in place of `0.0.0.0`.\nAdditionally, confirm that the networking rules on your server allow for access to port 5543.\n\nAfter visiting `http://0.0.0.0:5543` in a web browser, the home page for Sparsify will load if configured correctly:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_1.jpg\" width=\"960px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\nA quick start flow is given below. For a more in-depth read, check out [Sparsify documentation](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsify/).\n\n### New Project\n\nTo begin sparsifying a model, a new project must be created.\nThe New Project button is located in the lower right of Sparsify's home screen.\nAfter clicking, the create project popup will be displayed:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_7.jpg\" width=\"512px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\nSparsify only accepts [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) model formats currently.\nTo easily convert to ONNX from common ML frameworks, see the [SparseML repository.](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml)\n\n**Compatibility/Support Notes**\n- ONNX version 1.5-1.7\n- ONNX opset version 11+\n- ONNX IR version has not been tested at this time\n\nTo begin creating a project use one of the following flows:\n\n- Upload your model file through the browser by clicking on `Click to browse`.\n- Download your model file through a public URL by filling in the field `Remote Path or URL`.\n- Move your model file from an accessible file location on the server by filling in the field `Remote Path or URL`.\n\nContinue through the popup and fill in information as specified to finish creating the project.\n\n### Analyzing a Model\n\nAfter model creation, sensitivity analysis for the model are shown under the `Performance Profiles` and `Loss Profiles` in the left navigation.\n\nThe profiles will show the effects that different types of algorithms and degrees of those algorithms have on both the models inference speed and the baseline loss.\n\nPerformance Profiles:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_14.jpg\" width=\"960px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\nLoss Profiles:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_20.jpg\" width=\"960px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\n### Optimizing a Model\n\nClick on the `Optimization` in the left navigation or the `Start Optimizing` button on the analyzing pages to begin sparsifying your model.\nAfter clicking, the sparsification creation popup will be displayed:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_26.jpg\" width=\"512px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\nFill in the information as required in the modal.\nOnce completed, Sparsify's autoML algorithms will choose the best settings it can find for optimizing your model.\nThe resulting recipe will be displayed along with estimated metrics for the optimized model.\nThe recipe can then be further edited if desired:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_28.jpg\" width=\"960px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\n### Exporting a Recipe\n\nCurrently Sparsify is focused on training-aware methods; these allow much better loss recovery for a given target performance.\nA future release will enable the option of one-shot sparsification with limited to no retraining.\n\nGiven that the recipe is created with training-aware algorithms, it must be exported for inclusion in your original training pipeline using [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).\nSparseML enables this inclusion with only a few lines of code for most training workflows.\n\nOn the optimization page, click the `Export` button in the bottom right.\nThis will open up the export popup:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/main/docs/source/userguide/images/image_60.jpg\" width=\"512px\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\" /><br>\n\nSelect the framework the model was originally trained in on the upper right of the popup.\nOnce selected, either copy or download the recipe for use with SparseML.\nIn addition, some sample code using SparseML is given to integrate the exported sparsification recipe.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Learning More\n\n- Documentation: [SparseML,](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparseml/) [SparseZoo,](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsezoo/) [Sparsify,](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparsify/) [DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/)\n- Neural Magic: [Blog,](https://www.neuralmagic.com/blog/) [Resources](https://www.neuralmagic.com/resources/)\n\n### Release History\n\nOfficial builds are hosted on PyPI\n\n- stable: [sparsify](https://pypi.org/project/sparsify/)\n- nightly (dev): [sparsify-nightly](https://pypi.org/project/sparsify-nightly/)\n\nAdditionally, more information can be found via [GitHub Releases.](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/releases)\n\n### License\n\nThe project is licensed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Community\n\n### Contribute\n\nWe appreciate contributions to the code, examples, integrations, and documentation as well as bug reports and feature requests!

One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.} \n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{\n    singh2020woodfisher,\n    title={WoodFisher: Efficient Second-Order Approximation for Neural Network Compression}, \n    author={Sidak Pal Singh and Dan Alistarh},\n    year={2020},\n    eprint={2004.14340},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n```",
