    "description": "===============================\nJVZoo.com integration for Plone\n===============================\n\nA Plone add-on that integrates `JVZoo <http://jvzoo.com>`_ digital\nproducts retailer system with `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ to enable paid\nmemberships on your site.\n\n* `Source code @ GitHub <https://github.com/niteoweb/niteoweb.jvzoo>`_\n* `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/niteoweb.jvzoo>`_\n* `Documentation @ ReadTheDocs <http://readthedocs.org/docs/niteowebjvzoo>`_\n* `Continuous Integration @ Travis-CI <http://travis-ci.org/niteoweb/niteoweb.jvzoo>`_\n\n\nHow it works\n============\n\n#. Visitor comes to ``yoursite.com/order`` (or similar) and clicks `Order` link.\n#. Visitor is sent to JVZoo's order form (on ``http://jvzoo.com``),\n   where he enters his personal information and performs payment.\n#. JVZoo calls-back a special view on your plone site (``/@@jvzoo``),\n   which reads POST data from JVZoo, verifies it against your\n   ``Secret Key`` and creates a new member.\n#. The following information is stored in member data for later use:\n\n    ``product_id``\n        JVZoo's `Product ID` of the purchased item.\n\n    ``product_name``\n        JVZoo's `Product Name` of the purchased item.\n\n    ``affiliate``\n        Affiliate who referred the buyer.\n\n    ``last_purchase_id``\n        JVZoo's `Receipt ID` of the last purchase. This field gets updated\n        on every recurring payment.\n\n    ``last_purchase_timestamp``\n        Exact timestamp of the last purchase. This field gets updated on every\n        recurring payment.\n\n#. Upon creating a new member, Plone sends an email with login password.\n#. An ``IMemberCreateEvent`` is emitted upon creating a new member.\n#. The new member can now login and use the site.\n#. It is possible to create a ``product_id`` to ``group_name`` mapping in\n   Plone Control Panel. This means that if a member purchased a product which\n   is listed in this mapping, the member will also be added to a group mapped\n   to this product.\n\n.. note::\n\n    If a member already exists in Plone, then the ``@@jvzoo`` view simply\n    updates ``last_purchase_id`` and ``last_purchase_timestamp`` member fields.\n    The member will also be added to the new product group, but also kept in\n    the old.\n\n\nDemo\n====\n\nYou can see this product in action at\n`BigContentSearch <http://bigcontentsearch.com/>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install ``niteoweb.jvzoo`` you simply add\n``niteoweb.jvzoo`` to the list of eggs in your buildout, run\nbuildout and restart Plone. Then, install `niteoweb.jvzoo` using the\nAdd-ons control panel.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nJVZoo\n-----\n\nGo to `JVZoo.com <http://jvzoo.com>`_ and use ``Sellers`` ->\n``Add a Product`` to add a new `Product`.\n\nThen check the option ``External Program Integration``. For `URL`\nset ``http://yoursite.com/@@jvzoo``. Under the ``My Account`` page\nset the ``JVZIPN Secret Key``.\n\n\nPlone\n-----\n\nGo to ``Site Setup`` -> ``jvzoo`` control panel form and configure\nthe ``Secret Key`` field by pasting in the `Secret Key` you defined above.\n\nYou can also configure the ``product_id`` to ``group_name`` mapping. This comes\nin effect when member purchases a product which is listed in this mapping, the\nmember will also be added to a group mapped to this product.\n\nFor example, imagine you have the following in your mapping::\n\n    1|basic-members\n    2|premium-members\n\nMembers purchasing the product with id ``1`` will be added to the\n``basic-members`` group, whose purchasing ``2`` will be added to the\n``premium-members`` group. For others, nothing will be done.\n\nWhen switching products, an updated member will be added to new product\ngroup, but also kept in the old group. No information is removed/deleted.\n\n\nTest it\n=======\n\nYou are now ready to do a test buy! Go back to ``Sellers`` and click\n``Test Purchases``. Select a product, click ``Create Test Purchase Code`` and\nfinish by clicking the link in ``Buy / Link`` column in the table below. In\norder for the purchase link to work, the product needs to be activated in\n``Sellers Dashboard`` (select a product and check ``Allow Sales``).\n\nBefore you finish the transaction, you of course need to set up your Plone\nsite to receive JVZoo server notifications.\n\nConfirm by logging-in to http://jvzoo.com and checking to see if there were any\npurchases (on ``Sellers`` tab). Also check if your received an email with\nusername and password for accessing your site and try to login with them.\n\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\n* If members stop paying for monthly or yearly subscriptions, you have to\n  manually delete them from your Plone site.\n\n* The same as above goes for any chargebacks or refunds. You have to manage\n  them manually.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.3 (2012-12-03)\n----------------\n\n- When a member is cancelled, send notification email to site administrator.\n  [matejc]\n\n- If \"ctranstime\" is empty, set current time.\n  [matejc]\n\n- Support for handling 'RFND' requests from JVZoo.\n  [matejc]\n\n\n0.2 (2012-11-06)\n----------------\n\n- Add functionality for auto cancelation and tests.\n  [matejc]\n\n0.1 (2012-10-16)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [matejc, zupo]\n\nLicense (3-clause BSD)\n======================\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, NiteoWeb Ltd.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n  documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of NiteoWeb Ltd. nor the names of its contributors may\n  be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n  without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
