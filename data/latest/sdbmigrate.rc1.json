    "description": "# SdbMigrate tool\n\nsdbmigrate - easy-peasy tool for applying set of SQL migration on PostgreSQL or MySQL. Supports sharding out of the box.\n\n\nSupported Python versions:\n\n    - 2.7.X\n    - 3.8.X\n\nSupported PostgreSQL versions:\n\n    - 9.6.X\n    - 10.X\n    - 11.X\n    - 13.X\n\nSupported MySQL versions:\n\n    - 5.7.X\n    - 8.0.X\n\n## Main features\n\n- work both for PostgreSQL and MySQL\n- schema versions out of the box\n- transactional and non-transactional steps\n- sharded migration steps\n- dry-run for transactional steps\n- ability to apply stored procedures/functions\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install sdbmigrate migrate you also need to install proper database connection library.\nFor Postgres it is \"psycopg2\", for MySQL it is \"mysqlclient\".\n\nUse one of the following recepies.\n\n1. Install for Postgres:\n```\npip install sdbmigrate[postgres]\n```\n2. Install for Mysql:\n```\npip install sdbmigrate[mysql]\n```\n3. Install for both Postgres and MySQL:\n```\npip install sdbmigrate[postgres,mysql]\n```\n\n## Getting started guide with sdbmigrate and PostgreSQL\n\n0. Install sdbmigrate\n\n```\npip install sdbmigrate[postgres]\n```\n\nor clone this repo.\n\n1. Install PostgreSQL on your system, see https://www.postgresql.org/download/\n\n2. Create PostgreSQL user, e.g. test/test:\n\n```\nsudo -u postgres createuser -p 5432 test --pwprompt\n```\n\n3. Create database for applying migrations, e.g. :\n\n```\nfor i in `seq 1 3` ; do echo $i ; sudo -u postgres createdb -p 5432 test_db$i ; done\n```\n\n4. Create YAML-config for sdbmigrate :\n\n```\n# a total number of shards for sharded tables\nshard_count: 16\n\n# shard distribution mode:\n# \"auto\" - sdbmigrate migrate distribute shard across DB servers before initial\n#          migration and then continue to use this distribution for all\n#          sharded migrations. shard_on_db/shard_count and databases info\n#          is used for such process.\n# \"manual\" - shard distribution is specified by shards params inside databases\n#            section\nshard_distribution_mode: auto\n\n# amount of shard perf DB master, used with shard_distribution_mode: \"auto\"\nshard_on_db: 8\n\n# information about database masters and their connection info\ndatabases:\n    - name: test_db1\n      host: 127.0.0.1\n      port: 5432\n      # supported DB types: [\"postgres\", \"mysql\"]\n      type: postgres\n      user: test\n      password: test\n\n    - name: test_db2\n      host: 127.0.0.1\n      port: 5436\n      # supported DB types: [\"postgres\", \"mysql\"]\n      type: postgres\n      user: test\n      password: test\n\n```\n\n5. Run sdbmigrate with test DB :\n\n```\nsdbmigrate.py -c sdbmigrate.yaml -d demo/test_migrations\n```\n\n6. See migrations on disk\n\n```\n$ ls -l demo/test_migrations\ntotal 24\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr  244 Jul 18 09:46 V0000__TRX_PLAIN__initial_types.sql\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr  902 Jul 18 09:42 V0001__TRX_PLAIN__initial_tables.sql\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr 3781 Jul 18 09:48 V0002__TRX_SHARD__initial_tables.sql\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr 1257 Jul 18 09:50 V0003__TRX_PLAIN__initial_procedures.sql\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr  133 Jul 23 08:08 V0004__NOTRX_SHARD__extra_indices.sql\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 dr dr   76 Jul 23 08:15 V0005__NOTRX_SHARD__drop_indices.sql\n\n$ cat demo/test_migrations/V0000__TRX_PLAIN__initial_types.sql\nCREATE TYPE item_type AS ENUM ('ownership', 'access');\nCREATE TYPE item_value_type AS ENUM ('durable', 'consumable');\nCREATE TYPE item_amount_unit AS ENUM ('number', 'time_seconds');\nCREATE TYPE operation_type AS ENUM ('deposit','withdrawal');\n\n```\n\n7. Inspect DB using psql or other tool:\n\n```\n$ sudo -u postgres psql -p 5432 test_db2\n=# \\d+\n...\n```\n\nSee more info about sdbmigrate internals in docs/internals.md\n\n## Running tests locally using Docker\n\n```\ncd src\nmake test\n```\n\n\n## Running tests locally\n\n1. Setup Postgres\n\n    Mac OS:\n    ```\n    brew install postgres\n    brew services start postgres\n    createuser -s postgres\n    psql -U postgres\n    ```\n\n    Create user and databases\n    ```\n    CREATE USER test_behave WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'test_behave';\n    CREATE DATABASE sdbmigrate1_behave OWNER test_behave;\n    CREATE DATABASE sdbmigrate2_behave OWNER test_behave;\n    ```\n\n2. Setup MySQL\n\n    Mac OS:\n    ```\n    brew install mysql\n    brew services start mysql\n    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p\n    <enter>\n    ```\n\n    Create user and databases\n    ```\n    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sdbmigrate1_behave;\n    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sdbmigrate2_behave;\n    CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'test_behave'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'test_behave';\n    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sdbmigrate1_behave.* TO 'test_behave'@'%';\n    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sdbmigrate2_behave.* TO 'test_behave'@'%';\n    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n    ```\n\n3. Setup python 2.7 and python 3.8 on your local machine.\n\n    Mac OS:\n    ```\n    brew install python@2.7 python@3.8\n    ```\n\n4. Install dev requirements.\n    ```\n    pip install -r src/requirements_dev.txt\n    ```\n\n5. Run tests\n    ```\n    make -C src test_local\n    ```\n",
