Anything MAY change at any time. This public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.\n\n* There is the `routeviews.peeringdb` package that has some great methods for interfacing with the PeeringDB API.\n* There is the `routeviews.yaml` module that can load and save YAML config files (without rearranging them).\n    * Depends on the [`ruamel.yaml` package](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/)\n* There is the `routeviews.ansible` package, that can load, modify, and save the Route Views Ansible Inventory.\n* There is the `routeviews.bgpsummery` module, that defines a `BGPSummary` class as well as functions for retrieving a `BGPSummary` from any collector.\n* There is the (start of a) `routeviews.api` module/package, for interfacing with the Route Views API/DB (undocumented).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Release Notes\n\nThis project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\n> Notice: Major version \"Zero\" (0.y.z) is for initial development. Today, anything MAY change with each minor release.\n\n## 0.3.6\n\n- Refactor `rvm-bgp-status` to make InfluxDB Tags more useful.\n    - `state` is now a Tag rather than a Field.\n    - Why? We would like to \"GROUP BY\" state in our InfluxDB queries!\n\n## 0.3.5\n\n- Upgrade `rvm-bgp-status` to add \"VTY Latency\" to the `bgp_status` InfluxDB measurement.\n    - `vty_latency_sec` field has been added when running `rvm-bgp-status --influxdb`\n    - Nice to get an idea of FRRouting's performance over time!\n- Refactor `rvm-bgp-status` to make InfluxDB Tags more useful.\n    - `state` is now a Tag rather than a Field.\n    - Why? We would like to \"GROUP BY\" state in our InfluxDB queries!\n- Remove redundant \"collector\" tag from InfluxDB measurements.\n    - InfluxDB automatically tags data with the \"host\" tag. So, the \"collector\" tag was redundant.\n\n## 0.3.4\n\n- Fix `rvm-latest-mrt` to always get the *LATEST* MRT files.\n    - For some reason, sorting MRT archives by 'latest change timestamp (ctime)' seems to be non-deterministic! As a result, this tool was prioritizing MRT files from as old as 2019 for some collectors!\n    - Solution: Sort alphabetically instead of using ctime. \n    Route Views' MRT Archives use a consistent \"YYYY-MM-DD\" naming scheme which works perfectly when sorted alphabetically!\n\n## 0.3.3\n\n- Fix `routeviews-peer-requests` to use consistent vertical whitespace.\n\n\n## 0.3.2\n\n* Upgrade `routeviews-peer-requests` to print the, \"effected Collector's(es) IP Addresses\" after updating the Ansible inventory.\n    * For Maintainers to copy or reference when completing peer requests.\n\n## 0.3.1\n\n* Fix `routeviews-peer-requests` to ignore 'non-operational' Routers/Collectors.\n    * Some Route Views collectors are non operational today.\n\n## 0.3.0\n\n> **⚠ NOTE:** Renamed `routeviews-build-peer` CLI Tool to `routeviews-peer-request`.\n> (Updated throughout this project's documentation)\n\n* Upgrade `routeviews-peer-requests` with full feature set! 🎉\n    - Add `--show-options` flag that can be used by ANYONE to check their potential peerings (at Internet Exchanges) with Route Views.\n    - Add `--multihop-index` argument, to create BGP multihop peering config on Route Views' Multihop Collectors.\n* `rvm-haproxy-stats` will fallback to `nc` if `socat` unavailable.\n\n\n## 0.2.6\n\n* Fix `rvm-haproxy-stats` CLI tool.\n    * InfluxDB line protocol was broken.\n    * Fixed a typo in the code that printed the InfluxDB line protocol.\n\n## 0.2.5\n\n* Add `rvm-haproxy-stats` CLI tool.\n    * Get stats from HAProxy Stick Tables on a Route Views collector.\n\n## 0.2.4\n\n* Add `--zipped` flag to `rvm-latest-mrt`.\n    * Only report files that have the \".bz2\" file extension.\n    * *Why?* Ubuntu seems to continually update the MRT update file.\n    This had made the 'age_sec' metric in InfluxDB pretty much useless.\n\n## 0.2.3\n\n* Update `rvm-latest-mrt` InfluxDB line protocol to be simpler.\n    * Updates and RIBs are separate concerns, so send up separate measurements instead of combining them into one line.\n    \n\n## 0.2.2\n\n* Create a 'GitHub Release' after delivering package to PyPI.org\n\n## 0.2.1\n\n* Add many InfluxDB tags to `rvm-latest-mrt`, and remove 2 fields (that were turned to tags).\n    * Using tags enables more useful and efficient querying in Grafana!\n\n## 0.2.0\n\n* Add a set of `rvm` (Route Views Monitor) CLI tools.\n    > **ℹ Tip:** The `rvm` tools listed below can run on any FRR-based Route Views collector.\n    * `rvm-latest-mrt`: Get metrics about the latest MRT Dump files on a Route Views collector.\n    * `rvm-bgp-status`: Get info about BGP Peerings on a Route Views collector.\n    * `rvm-bmp-status`: Get info about BMP sessions on a Route Views collector.\n* Add `--sudo` flag to CLI tools where appropriate.\n    * CLI tools that depend on `vtysh` will only use raise privileges when running `vtysh`.\n* Extract 'InfluxDB Line Protocol' logic into `routeviews.influx` module.\n    * Generate InfluxDB Line Protocol -- useful when using CLI tools as [Telegraf Exec Input Plugins](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec).\n* Extract 'TextFSM Template Parsing' logic into the `routeviews.parse.template_parse` function.\n    * See additional [discussion of TextFSM in our Design Docs](./design.md#textfsm-conventions)\n\n## 0.1.3\n\n* Fix Bug: `routeviews-peer-request` CLI tool rearranges the 'Route Views Peer Config' in the Ansible Inventory.\n    * Now we track the 'order' of attributes whenever loading any `routeviews.ansible.NeighborConfig` class from a YAML file.\n    That 'order' is then used when subsequently dumping the data, thus ensuring that nothing is rearranged unnecessarily!\n\n## 0.1.2\n\n* Bug: `routeviews-peer-request` CLI tool rearranges the 'Route Views Peer Config' in the Ansible Inventory.\n\n* Fix PeeringDB Authentication!\n    * See the [relevant GitHub Issue](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/1206#issuecomment-1202550667) where we discovered the following details about PeeringDB API Basic Authentication:\n    > 1. Do NOT base64 encode\n    > 2. Username/Password Must be space-separated (e.g., must not be colon \":\" separated)\n    > 3. Username when using API tokens is \"Api-Key\"\n    > 4. Ensure \"www\" is in all API requests!\n* Enable using PeeringDB API Key instead of username/password.\n    * Exposed via `--peeringdb-key` argument in `routeviews-peer-request` CLI tool (or as env var: `PEERINGDB_KEY`).\n* Add the filepath to the exception message when `routeviews.yaml` encounters a `ParseError`.\n    * This enables fixing syntax issues very quickly.\n    * \"Unable to parse `<filepath>`\" is the added message, seen below:\n    ```\n    ... omitted traceback for brevity...\n    routeviews.yaml.ParseError: while parsing a block mapping\n        in \"<unicode string>\", line 1, column 1:\n            short_name: decix\n            ^ (line: 1)\n    expected <block end>, but found '-'\n        in \"<unicode string>\", line 109, column 1:\n            - peer_as: 8888\n            ^ (line: 109)\n    Unable to parse <working-tree>/ansible/inventory/host_vars/route-views.decix.routeviews.org\n    ```\n* Ensure that PyVCR cassettes do not contain HTTP Basic Authentication secrets.\n    * Rotated the (randomly generated) Base64 encoded password that was previously exposed via HTTP Basic Authentication Headers. \n\n## 0.1.1\n\n* Fix Bug: Package failed to declare some critical dependencies. \n\n## 0.1.0\n\n> Bug: Package failed to declare some critical dependencies. \n> Was missing `uologging` and `raumel.yaml` dependencies deceleration in \"setup.py\".\n\nThe first release of the routeviews package contains some core CLI tools, as well as some functions/classes that might be useful to routeviews maintainers.\n\n### CLI Tools\n\nProvide new CLI tools! 🎉\n\n* [`routeviews-peer-request` CLI tool](./user-guide.md#routeviews-peer-request-cli-tool): automation of updating [\"Route Views Ansible inventory\"](https://github.com/routeviews/infra), toward 'adding BGP peers to XYZ collectors'.\n* [`routeviews-email-peers` CLI tool](./user-guide.md#routeviews-email-peers-cli-tool): get list of email addresses actively peered with a Route Views Collector.\n\n### Libraries\n\n* There is the `routeviews.peeringdb` package that has some great methods for interfacing with the PeeringDB API.\n* There is the `routeviews.yaml` module that can load and save YAML config files (without rearranging them).\n    * Depends on the [`ruamel.yaml` package](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/)\n* There is the `routeviews.ansible` package, that can load, modify, and save the Route Views Ansible Inventory.\n* There is the `routeviews.bgpsummery` module, that defines a `BGPSummary` class as well as functions for retrieving a `BGPSummary` from any collector.\n* There is the (start of a) `routeviews.api` module/package, for interfacing with the Route Views API/DB (undocumented).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
