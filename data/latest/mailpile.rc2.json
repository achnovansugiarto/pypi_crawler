    "description": "# Welcome to Mailpile! #\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/mailpile/Mailpile/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mailpile/Mailpile)\n\n\n## Introduction ##\n\nMailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client\nwith user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of\nMailpile is funded by\n[a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)\nand all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI\napproved Free Software license.\n\nMailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user\ninterface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to\nmake it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed\ne-mail.\n\nMailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic\ncommand-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology\nfor the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop\napplication (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a\nremote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.\n\nThe core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal\nwith large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine\nallows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and\nthe application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail\neither based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.\n\n**Note:** We are currently \"in beta\", which means the app's basic\nfeatures are (mostly) in place and packages are available for popular\noperating systems, for people who would like to help test and debug.\nFor more details\n[follow @MailpileTeam on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MailpileTeam)\nor [read our blog](https://www.mailpile.is/blog/).\n\n\n### Trying Mailpile\n\nWe have live demos up and running [on our\nwebsite](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what\nMailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.\n\n\n### Installing Mailpile\n\nNote that Mailpile is still in development and is not suitable for\nproduction or end-user use. However, developers and early adopters are\nencouraged to give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and\ndevelop new features.\n\nPlease see our [download page](https://www.mailpile.is/download/) or read\n[the Getting Started guide on our wiki](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/wiki/Getting-started).\n\n\n## Credits and License ##\n\nBjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>) created this!  If you think\nit's neat, you should also check out PageKite: <https://pagekite.net/>.\nAt some point Bjarni, that crafty fellow, convinced\n[Sm√°ri](<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>) and\n[Brennan](https://brennannovak.com) to start working on the project as\nwell.\n\nThe GMail guys get mad props for creating the best webmail service out\nthere. Wishing the Free Software world had something like it is what\ninspired Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. Edward Snowden also gets\nmad props for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for journalists\nand everday folks!\n\nContributors:\n\n- Bjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>)\n- Brennan Novak (<https://brennannovak.com/>)\n- Smari McCarthy (<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>)\n- Lots more, run `git shortlog -s` for a list! (Or see the list\n  [on Github](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/graphs/contributors).)\n\nAnd of course, we couldn't do this without [our community of\nbackers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community).\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of either the GNU Affero General Public License as\npublished by the Free Software Foundation or the Apache License 2.0 as\npublished by the Apache Software Foundation.
