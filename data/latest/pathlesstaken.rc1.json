taking a look at the [fndec][pathless-6] project I\ncreated in Golang and using utilities from Richard Lehane's\n[Siegfried][pathless-7]. More info after the jump.\n\n[pathless-6]: https://github.com/exponential-decay/fndec\n[pathless-7]: https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried\n\n## Docs\n\nAll docs are available in [docs](docs).\n\n```manpage\nDESCRIPTION\n    Module that implements checks against the Microsoft Recommendations for\n    file naming, plus additional recommended analyses documented below.\n\n    First created based on the recommendations here:\n        http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx\n\n    First available in:\n        https://github.com/exponential-decay/droid-siegfried-sqlite-analysis-engine\n\n    Methods defined here:\n     |\n     |  complete_file_name_analysis(self, string, folders=False, verbose=False)\n     |      Run all analyses over a string object. The analyses are as follows:\n     |\n     |      * detect_non_ascii_characters\n     |      * detect_non_recommended_characters\n     |      * detect_non_printable_characters\n     |      * detect_microsoft_reserved_names\n     |      * detect_spaces_at_end_of_names\n     |      * detect_period_at_end_of_name\n     |\n     |  detect_microsoft_reserved_names(self, string)\n     |      Detect names that are considered difficult on Microsoft file\n     |      systems. There is a special history to these characters which can be\n     |      read about on this link below:\n     |\n     |          * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx\n     |\n     |  detect_non_ascii_characters(self, string, folders=False)\n     |      Detect characters outside of an ASCII range. These are more\n     |      difficult to preserve in today's systems, even still, though it is\n     |      getting easier.\n     |\n     |  detect_non_printable_characters(self, string, folders=False)\n     |      Detect control characters below 0x20 in the ASCII table that cannot\n     |      be printed. Examples include ESC (escape) or BS (backspace).\n     |\n     |  detect_non_recommended_characters(self, string, folders=False)\n     |      Detect characters that are not particularly recommended. These\n     |      characters for example a forward slash '/' often have other meanings\n     |      in computer systems and can be interpreted incorrectly if not handled\n     |      properly.\n     |\n     |  detect_period_at_end_of_name(self, string, folders=False)\n     |      Detect a full-stop at the end of a name. This might indicate a\n     |      missing file extension.\n     |\n     |  detect_spaces_at_end_of_names(self, string, folders=False)\n     |      Detect spaces at the end of a string. These spaces if ignored can\n     |      lead to incorrectly matching strings, e.g. 'this ' is different to\n     |      'this'.\n     |\n```\n\n### License\n\nThis unique parts of this code is licensed using [GPLv3](LICENSE)\n\n\n",
