    "description": "Gloopy provides the following services:\n\n- Creation and manipulation of 3D, flat-surfaced, polyhedra, using the\n  Shape class.\n- Factory functions to produce particular shapes, such as Cube or Icosahedron.\n- Some basic algorithms to modify existing shapes, such as by subdividing or\n  extruding their surfaces.\n- Conversion of shapes into Glyph instances, which\n  manage vertex arrays stored in a VBO.\n- A simple Render class which renders glyphs\n  with given positions and orientations.\n- A camera attribute on the single Gloopy instance,\n  that can be positioned, oriented, or told to look at a particular item or\n  position.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nWritten mostly on Windows, tested occasionally on Ubuntu.\n\n- Python 2.7\n- Pyglet 1.1.4\n- PyOpenGL 3.0.1\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nIn the Gloopy source, see gloopy/docs/html/index.html\n\nand the scripts in the 'examples' directory.\n\nDocumentation is not currently available online.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nGloopy is released under the New BSD License, the text of which is to be found\nin the project's LICENSE.txt. Alternatively, you may use it under the terms of\nany other OSI-approved license.\n\n\nStatus & Known Issues\n---------------------\n\nIt works for me, but has not been used any real projects. The API is\na mess and may change substantially in later releases.\n\nNo issue tracker is currently maintained, but the major shortfalls as\nI percieve them are:\n\n- Some algorithmic modifiers, such as face subdivision, extrusion, stellation,\n  do not currently work on MultiShapes. This is because these modifiers rely\n  on modifying attributes of the given shape in place, such as by inserting\n  new entries in the .faces collection. However, MultiShapes provide many of\n  these attributes by using generators to form a composite stream of their\n  children. I guess I ought to make all shape modifiers functional.\n- The supplied 'directional lighting' shader is broken - rotating an object\n  does not modify the apparent illumination of its surfaces.\n- No attempt is made to handle textures. All faces are plain colors.\n- We don't currently handle multiple shaders within a single scene.\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\n`PyWeek <http://pyweek.org>`_ participants 'Scav' and 'Threads' for showing me\nhow it should be done, and PyWeek message board users donal.h, Cosmologicon,\nRB[0], PyTM30, Tee and saluk for cajoling me into accepting the merit of\nallowing people to bring pre-existing codebases into PyWeek so long as they\nare public.",
