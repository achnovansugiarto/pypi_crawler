Redistribution.

The contents\r\n\t          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n\t          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n\t          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n\t          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n\t          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n\t          as modifying the License.\r\n\t\r\n\t      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n\t      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n\t      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n\t      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n\t      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n\t      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\t\r\n\t   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n\t      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n\t      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n\t      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n\t      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n\t      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n\t      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\t\r\n\t   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n\t      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n\t      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n\t      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\t\r\n\t   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n\t      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n\t      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n\t      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n\t      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n\t      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n\t      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n\t      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n\t      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\t\r\n\t   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n\t      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n\t      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n\t      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n\t      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n\t      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n\t      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n\t      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n\t      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n\t      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n\t      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\t\r\n\t   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n\t      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n\t      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n\t      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n\t      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\r\n\t      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\r\n\t      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\r\n\t      identification within third-party archives.\r\n\t\r\n\t   Copyright 2021 Clowd Haus, LLC.\r\n\t\r\n\t   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n\t   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n\t   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\t\r\n\t       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\t\r\n\t   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n\t   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n\t   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n\t   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n\t   limitations under the License.\r\n\t",
