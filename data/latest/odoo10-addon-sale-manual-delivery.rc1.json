If activated,\na sale order won't direcly impact directly the stock. It will not make a reservation on the stock.\nIt allows the delivery and the impact on stock to be done manually when needed.\nThe goal is to be used on long term projects where not all the material is shipped at once.\nAs you make many shipments, every time you make a new delivery, you can choose an new carrier as well\nas a planned date. A wizard helps you to chose what to deliver by showing you how much you already \nplanned to ship.\n\nIn many cases, is the warehouse user the one that goes to the SO and ship. This\nusually is a pain because there are many shipments and finding the proper one\nis complicated. For those reasons it is very useful to have a menu in Inventory\nto create the delivery directly and also do it at sale order line level. \n\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n* Add Screenshots\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues>`_.
