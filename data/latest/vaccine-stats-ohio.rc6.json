IN NO EVENT SHALL THE\nAUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,\nOUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE\nSOFTWARE.\n\n# Installation\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.\n\n```bash\npip install vaccine-stats-ohio\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n## Initialize data\n\nTo get started, import the `Vax_Stats` class and initialize it. Vaccine statistics are automatically downloaded from the [Ohio Department of Health website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccination-dashboard) and stored in a temporary file.\n\n```python\nfrom vaccine_stats import Vax_Stats\n\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    ...\n```\n\nNote that you may also want to import the date class, as it is used frequently in data lookups.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n```\n\n## Find the latest date for which data is published\n\nODH updates their data approximately daily. You can use the `odh_latest` function to determine what day the latest data is for. Note that data for the current day is usually incomplete, therefore it is wise to look back at least a day or two for accurate statistics.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    latest_date = data.odh_latest()\nprint(latest_date)\n\n# Output: 2021-02-23\n```\n\n## Look up vaccination data\n\nVaccine data can be browsed by county and date using the `lookup` function. Statistics are returned as a tuple of integers mirroring the ODH data file. The first item is the number of vaccines started (i.e., the number of people who got their first dose) and the second item is the number of vaccines completed (i.e., the number of people who got their second dose). It is unclear how results will be reported if a vaccine that only requires one dose is distributed (we can cross that bridge when we get to it).\n\nBy default, data is returned cumulatively for all counties up through the current date.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    n = data.lookup()\nprint(n)\n\n# Output: (1474872, 707396)\n# There were 1.47 million vaccination series started, with 0.71 million having been completed, in the state of Ohio as of the date this was run.\n```\n\nData can also be returned for inidividual counties and/or through a past date.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    n = data.lookup(county=\"Cuyahoga\", date=date(2021, 2, 1))\nprint(n)\n\n# Output: (94757, 24969)\n# There were a total of 95k vaccination series started, with 25k having been completed, in Cuyahoga county as of February 1, 2021.\n```\n\nData can also be displayed for an individual date (not cumulatively) using the `cumulative=False` argument.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    n = data.lookup(\n        county=\"Cuyahoga\",\n        date=date(2021, 2, 1),\n        cumulative=False\n        )\nprint(n)\n\n# Output: (2065, 2804)\n# There were 2,065 first vaccines and 2,804 second vaccines given in Cuyahoga county on February 1, 2021.\n```\n\n## See changes over time\n\nThe `delta` function takes two dates and returns a tuple in the same format as the `lookup` function, but with numbers indicating the percent change in *cumulative* vaccinations between two dates.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    p = data.delta(\n        back_date=date(2021, 2, 7),\n        front_date=date(2021, 2, 14)\n        )\nprint(p)\n\n# Output: (18.4, 48.6)\n# There were 18.4% more vaccination series started and 48.6% more vaccination series completed on February 14 compared to a week prior.\n```\n\nThe `delta` function can also output raw vaccination numbers instead of percentages using the `percent=False` argument.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    n = data.delta(\n        back_date=date(2021, 2, 7),\n        front_date=date(2021, 2, 14),\n        percent=False\n        )\nprint(n)\n\n# Output: (208761, 162962)\n# There were 209k more vaccination series started and 163k more vaccination series completed on February 14 compared to a week prior.\n```\n\nThe `delta` function also takes `county` as an argument, defaulting to `county=\"All\"`.\n\n## Find the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated\n\nThe percentage of the population that has been vaccinated can be found using the `percent_vaccinated` function. This defaults to showing the current totals for all counties. The function can be customized using the `county` and `date` arguments as per above.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    p = data.percent_vaccinated()\nprint(p)\n\n# Output: 6.1\n# A total of 6.1% of Ohio's population has completed their COVID vaccine series as of the date the program was run.\n```\n\nData can also be displayed based on the number of people who received at least one dose of the vaccine rather than just those who have completed a vaccination series using the `fully_vaccinated=False` argument. \n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    p = data.percent_vaccinated(fully_vaccinated=False)\nprint(p)\n\n# Output: 12.6\n# A total of 12.6% of Ohio's population has received at least one COVID vaccine as of the date the program was run.\n```\n\n## Predict when herd immunity will be reached\n\nThe `predict_herd_immunity` function attempts to estimate a date at which herd immunity will be significantly reached based on current vaccination trends.\n\n> ### **Caution**\n> This function makes a number of assumptions that must be carefully considered.\n>\n> * The `r_0` (r<sub>0</sub>) argument defaults to 6.5. This is based on reports from medical literature and the media in the context of the now-predominant delta variant.<sup>1,2</sup>\n> * The use of r<sub>0</sub> is inherently flawed because if assumes a completely susceptible population.<sup>3</sup> In other words, it does not account for individuals becoming less susceptible due to previous infection or vaccination. Previous estimates of r<sub>0</sub> also do not account for changes in transmissibility due to emerging vaccine variants.\n> * The model currently assumes that a complete vaccination with a booster confers 93% protection against COVID-19 (`booster_efficacy=0.93`), complete vaccination without a booster confers 48% protection (`full_efficacy=0.48`), and a single dose confers 10% protection (`started_efficacy=0.1`).<sup>4,5</sup> The efficacy of a single dose has not been studied in the context of the predominant delta variant, so this number is a guess. The model does not take into account the time it takes for immunity to be reached after vaccination and does not account for immunity waning over time.\n> * The model calculates the rate at which people are being vaccinated using the `delta` function and extrapolates this into the future assuming a linear vaccination rate. In reality, vaccination rates may be nonlinear or otherwise fluctuate based on a number of factors including product availability, emergency use authorization of novel vaccines, and prevailing attitudes towards vaccination.\n> * Because data is analyzed in aggregate for the state of Ohio, the assumption is that vaccination pravalence and incidence are homogenous across the state. This is not the case. Because of differences in geographic vaccination rates, many areas may see herd immunity slower than predicted.\n>\n> Because of these limitations, output from this function should be viewed with a high degree of skepticism. It constitutes a best effort attempt at predicting when herd immunity will be reached, but with a high degree of variability that is itself difficult to quantify. See Disclaimer above.\n\n```python\nwith Vax_Stats() as data:\n    d = data.predict_herd_immunity()\nprint(d)\n\n# Output: 2022-01-13\n# The predicted immunity date is January 13, 2022 as of the date the program was run.\n```\n\n# Contributing\nPull requests are welcome.
