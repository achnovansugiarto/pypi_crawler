    "description": "# thirdparty.builder.assist\n\nTool for automatically building code on save.\n\n## Usage Synopsis\n\n```\nassist -p <path to watch> -- <command to run>\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nInotify (i.e. inotifywait) and other file change notification systems will send many events all at once about how a file is being accessed or changed. You can't you these raw events to trigger a build because you'd start running the build prematurely.\n\nThis script is designed to watch for only mutation events (i.e. it ignores opens, accesses, and close with nowrite). When using an editor like VSCode, it is constantly accessing file meta data to determine if it needs to reread files. We should not build everytime VSCode merely reads the metadata of a file path.\n\nThe script waits for the inotify events to settle before running the build again. For example, you may run a formatter that modifies many files in the source directory. You don't want the build command to be executed after only the first file has been written, you need to wait until all files have been touched. This settlement is detected with a simple timeout. It waits for a given duration of no events after an event before running the given reaction command.\n\nThe script will not queue commands to run while changes are incoming. If the given command takes a while to run, changes might be made to the source while the command is running. The last change time is recorded and this is checked against the last time the command was executed. If the difference is greater than the given settlement duration it'll rerun the command.\n\nThe script has a signal handler to catch Ctrl-C. Ctrl-C is the expected way to exit the watcher.py while its waiting for updates. I don't know what the behavior of the system is if you Ctrl-C/SIGINT while the given user command is being executed.\n\n## Install\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade thirdparty-builder-assist\n```\n\n## CLI Usage\n\nThirdparty Builder Assist includes a console script `assist`. The intended use for this is to run a file watcher for a source directory and automatically run a build and/or test command after there have been no changes to any files for 1 second.\n\nIf your current working directory is `/project`, and this project is a make project will all source stored in `/project/src`, you can use `assist` to automatically run `make` using a command like the following:\n\n```\nassist -p src -- make\n```\n\n## API Usage\n\nThirdparty Builder Assist comes with an API that allows your code to react to inotify events the same way the `assist` console script does. Using the same example above, here is an example Python snippet prints a message when change events are detected.\n\n```\nfrom thirdparty.builder.assist import start_watching\nfrom time import sleep\n\n# Fire up builder.assist thread.\nassist_context = start_watching('/project/src')\n\nwhile True:\n    sleep(0.1)\n    if assist_context.is_event():\n        print(\"Detected changes.\")\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contributions and feature requests are welcome!
